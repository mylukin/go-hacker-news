## MCP-B: A Protocol for AI Browser Automation

- 原文链接: [MCP-B: A Protocol for AI Browser Automation](https://mcp-b.ai/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44515403)

MCP-B is a new tool that lets AI interact with websites much faster and easier. Instead of acting like a robot that clicks buttons and reads screens, MCP-B gives AI real access to a website’s functions.

The main idea is simple: add about 50 lines of code to your website, and AI assistants can use your site’s APIs with no extra setup. Unlike old methods, MCP-B does not need API keys or OAuth—AI can use your website just like a real user, using the browser’s existing authentication. This makes tasks run in milliseconds instead of seconds or minutes. There’s a live demo showing how fast and smooth it is, and the extension works on all major browsers. The MCP-B server runs inside the web page, using your current login and permissions, so there is no need for extra security steps.

With MCP-B, there’s no screen-scraping or clicking on UI elements, so things won’t break when the website changes its look. AI assistants get direct, structured data from the site, making automation fast and reliable. The setup process is very easy for developers: install the package, create the server, and you’re done. For users, there’s nothing special to do—just use the browser as normal, and AI tools work right away.

The protocol is also designed to be secure and private. All processing happens on your device, and your data does not leave your computer unless you allow it. MCP-B supports cross-application workflows and lets other AI extensions connect, so it can be extended for more uses. It is open-source and community-driven.

In the comments, many people are excited about how simple MCP-B makes browser automation. Some think it could become the new standard for letting AIs work with web apps. Others worry about security, asking what happens if a bad extension uses MCP-B to get private data. A few developers say they want to try it because it could save time on complex OAuth setups. Some are unsure if website owners will want to add the MCP-B code, since it means more access for AI tools. One user says this might not work on very locked-down apps, but others reply that using browser authentication is both clever and practical. There is also discussion about possible misuse, but supporters point out that MCP-B respects existing permissions and does not give more access than the user already has. Overall, people like the speed, ease of setup, and the new approach to browser AI automation.

## Tree Borrows

- 原文链接: [Tree Borrows](https://plf.inf.ethz.ch/research/pldi25-tree-borrows.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44510600)

Tree Borrows is a new idea for handling ownership and pointer safety in the Rust programming language, especially when using unsafe code. The article explains that Rust normally gives strong safety guarantees through its type system, but sometimes programmers need to use “unsafe” code, which can break these guarantees if not used carefully.

The main problem is: how can the Rust compiler make powerful optimizations without being tricked by unsafe code that does things it shouldn’t? An older model called Stacked Borrows tried to set clear rules, but it was too strict and blocked some code that real Rust programmers often write. Also, it didn’t work well with some newer features in Rust.

Tree Borrows is a new model that replaces the “stack” from Stacked Borrows with a “tree.” This small change makes a big difference. It lets the system accept more real-world Rust code—when tested on 30,000 popular Rust projects, it rejected 54% fewer cases than Stacked Borrows. Tree Borrows still allows most of the same compiler optimizations, and even enables some new ones, like reordering read operations. The team behind Tree Borrows also proved, using a tool called Rocq, that these rules are sound. Because of its impact, this work won a Distinguished Paper Award at PLDI’25.

In the Hacker News comments, some people are excited about the improvements, saying Tree Borrows could finally make Rust’s unsafe code easier to use and reason about. Others point out that while the model is more permissive, it may also be harder to understand or teach, which could make writing correct unsafe code more confusing. Some users worry about the complexity of the rules and whether tool support, like for the Miri interpreter, will keep up. Others ask if this will help with common Rust problems like aliasing or FFI (foreign function interface) issues. There are also debates about whether making the rules looser will let in more bugs, or if it just recognizes how people actually write code. A few people want to know if this will affect stable Rust soon, or if it’s just for academics. Some see this as a natural next step as Rust matures, while others are cautious and want to see more real-world testing. Overall, most agree that it’s a useful and important update for the Rust language.

## A Typology of Canadianisms

- 原文链接: [A Typology of Canadianisms](https://dchp.arts.ubc.ca/how-to-use)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44515101)

This article explains how the DCHP-3, a dictionary of Canadian English, sorts words and meanings called “Canadianisms.” It breaks these into six types, like words that started in Canada, words kept in Canada but lost elsewhere, or words that changed meaning in Canada. For example, “garburator” (a kitchen device) began in Canada, “pencil crayon” is still used in Canada but not in the US, and “toque” changed from meaning a chef’s hat to a warm winter hat. Some words are special to Canadian culture, like “universal healthcare,” hockey terms, or “eh.” Others are used much more often in Canada, like “washroom” instead of “restroom.” There’s also a type for words that remind people of sad or dark history, like “residential school.” If a word was once thought Canadian but isn’t, it gets marked as “Non-Canadian.” The dictionary gives each word a label, shows where it’s used, and includes examples from real Canadian writing or speech. Charts show how often and where words are used, and labels explain if words are slang, formal, old, or used in certain places or groups. There are also labels for topics like weather, sports, law, and regions like Alberta or Quebec.

In the comments, some people say this is a great resource for anyone learning about Canadian English or culture. Others are surprised at some of the words, like “pencil crayon,” because they thought everyone used them. A few note that some words, like “washroom,” are common in other places too, so it’s not always clear if they’re only Canadian. Some users share their own stories about moving to Canada and learning new words, while others point out that language changes fast and words can shift categories over time. There are comments about how the dictionary helps keep track of both fun and serious parts of Canadian life, and some wish more countries had similar resources. A few debate whether certain words really count as “Canadianisms” or if they’re just rare in the US. Others ask about the methods for counting word frequency and what makes a word truly Canadian. Overall, people seem interested in how language shows history and culture, and many want to see more examples or updates.

- 原文链接: [Show HN: FlopperZiro – A DIY open-source Flipper Zero clone](https://github.com/lraton/FlopperZiro)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44512763)

This article is about FlopperZiro, a simple, do-it-yourself copy of the Flipper Zero device, but made to be cheap and open source. The creator made it for fun, not for professional use, and used the Arduino IDE to program it.

The project uses common electronic parts like an STM32 microcontroller, a radio transmitter and receiver, an RFID/NFC chip, an IR LED, a small OLED display, a micro SD card slot, push buttons, a battery, and a battery charger. The device can read and copy signals from infrared (IR) or radio frequency (RF) remotes, save them, and send them out again. It also partly supports RFID/NFC (this part is still being finished). You can save and load data from an SD card, see battery and memory info, and control everything with simple menus. The shell can be 3D printed, but the design is not done yet.

Software tasks left include fixing SD card bugs, finishing the RF and IR features, improving menus, and making the RFID part work better. For hardware, the creator wants to improve the printed circuit board (PCB) and try a different RFID chip. There is also a need to add more documentation.

The whole project is open source and uses the GPL-3.0 license. The creator is clear that this is just a hobby project and not meant to replace a real Flipper Zero.

In the Hacker News comments, some people are excited and say it’s great to see a low-cost, open clone of the Flipper Zero. A few users think this is a good learning tool, especially for people who want to understand hardware and coding. Others note that the Flipper Zero is hard to buy now, so a DIY version is welcome.

Some users worry that the project could be used for bad things, but most agree that learning and experimenting should not be blocked. A few comment on the creator’s funny, simple English and like the light-hearted style. Several people ask how hard it is to build and if there are full guides or kits to help beginners. Others suggest ways to improve the hardware or code, and share their own hacks and ideas for using the device.

Overall, the community seems positive, with many thanking the creator for sharing this open project, and some even offering to help make it better. There are also suggestions to make the documentation clearer, so more people can try building their own FlopperZiro.

## The jank programming language

- 原文链接: [The jank programming language](https://jank-lang.org/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44482273)

The article talks about a new programming language called jank, which is similar to Clojure but runs on C++ and LLVM instead of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). jank wants to give users the interactive and functional style of Clojure, but with faster native code and smaller runtimes.

jank is still being made, so not all features are finished. The language is very close to Clojure, using the same code-as-data ideas and macro system. It supports persistent, immutable data structures, but when you need to change data, it has safe tools for multi-threaded work.

One big feature is the ability to use C++ code directly inside Clojure files. You can call C++ functions and mix Clojure and C++ in the same file. jank uses LLVM for Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, so your code can run fast and create small programs. The article shows how jank has much faster start times than Clojure on JVM.

Error messages in jank are clear, not long and confusing like JVM stack traces. The language plans to support popular tools like Leiningen, Language Server Protocol (LSP), and nREPL, making it easy for developers to use with their favorite editors.

The article gives several code examples: looping over game state, calling OpenGL functions with C++, making a movie genre index, converting bytes to human-readable sizes, truncating strings, and redefining functions for tests. These examples show that jank can do real work and is good for both functional and more traditional programming styles.

jank’s data structures are immutable, but you can work with data easily using built-in tools. The language lets you change variable definitions in a safe way for testing, so you can avoid side effects. There is also a strong focus on good developer experience, with useful error handling and easy-to-use tools.

In the Hacker News comments, many people are excited to see a new Clojure-like language that does not need the JVM. Some say they have wanted something like this for years, especially for smaller programs or games. They like the fast startup and the chance to write both Clojure and C++ together.

Others are cautious, pointing out that making a new language is a huge task. They wonder if jank can really keep up with JVM Clojure’s many libraries and mature ecosystem. Some users ask about Windows support, since many Clojure tools focus on Linux or macOS.

A few comments praise the clear error messages and say this is something Clojure has needed. Some people are not sure if mixing C++ and Clojure in one file is a good idea, since it might make code harder to read or debug. Others think it is powerful, especially for systems programming or when you need speed.

There is also talk about tooling. Some users hope jank will have good editor support and easy debugging from the start. A few are worried about the language changing too quickly, since it is still under heavy development. But overall, the mood is hopeful, with many saying they will watch the project and maybe try it for their own work.

- 原文链接: [Show HN: MCP server for searching and downloading documents from Anna's Archive](https://github.com/iosifache/annas-mcp)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44514753)

This project is a tool that helps people search and download documents from Anna’s Archive using an MCP server. The software connects Anna’s Archive with MCP clients, such as Claude Desktop, making it easy to find and get documents—like books or papers—directly to your computer.

The main features are simple: you can search for documents by typing in what you want, and you can download any document you find through the search. To use the tool, you need an MCP client, an API key from Anna’s Archive (which you get by donating), and you must set up two environment variables: one for your API key and one for the folder where downloads go. The setup is easy if you follow the example in the README, and there is even a screenshot showing how it looks in Claude Desktop. The project is written mostly in Go, with some shell scripts, and has a clear folder structure. The author also says the tool is only for legal use—respecting copyright and using the API for things like public domain materials or Creative Commons works.

In the Hacker News comments, some users are happy to see a tool that makes Anna’s Archive easier to use, especially together with other apps. Others ask about the legal risks and point out that Anna’s Archive has both legal and illegal content, so users must be careful. There are questions about why an API key and donation are needed, with replies explaining this helps support the archive and stops abuse. A few people share tips for running the tool on different systems or using it for research. Some worry about the project’s future if Anna’s Archive faces legal problems. Others like how open source makes it possible to keep the project going even if the main site goes down. One user wonders if this approach could help other archives or digital libraries.

## Show HN: Petrichor – a free, open-source, offline music player for macOS

- 原文链接: [Show HN: Petrichor – a free, open-source, offline music player for macOS](https://github.com/kushalpandya/Petrichor)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44515266)

Petrichor is a new, free, open-source music player for macOS that works offline. The creator built it because they missed having a good offline music player, especially after using Swinsian, which hasn’t seen updates in a long time.

Petrichor lets you map music folders, browse your library, create playlists, and manage your play queue. You can pin albums, artists, or playlists to the sidebar for quick access. There’s a folder view, and you can quickly search even large libraries. The app uses macOS features like playback controls in the menu bar and dock, and it supports dark mode. You can right-click a track to jump to its album or artist. Petrichor works best if your music files have good metadata, since it relies on this information to organize your library. The app is built with Swift and SwiftUI, uses a SQLite database with full-text search, and plays music using Apple’s AVFoundation framework. It does not change your files; it just indexes and reads them. Planned features include smart playlists, AirPlay 2 support, a mini player, online album info, and more.

To install, you just download the DMG file, drag Petrichor into Applications, and open it. You need macOS 14 or later. There are also instructions for developers who want to build the app themselves. The project is licensed under MIT and gives credits to various open-source tools and tutorials used.

Hacker News users had many thoughts. Some people were excited to see a new offline music player, saying there aren’t many good options for macOS. A few users worried about needing macOS 14, since some older Macs can’t upgrade. Others liked that the app doesn’t change their music files and respects their folder structure. Some users asked about features like gapless playback or support for more file formats, while others suggested adding things like Last.fm scrobbling or lyrics support. There were questions about how well the app handles large libraries, and some users pointed out the importance of good metadata. A few people mentioned they still use iTunes or Swinsian, while others hoped Petrichor could become a strong alternative. Some praised the clean interface and open-source nature, while others wondered if an iOS version might come in the future. Overall, the community seemed happy to see new life in this space, but also offered many ideas and requests for future updates.

## A fast 3D collision detection algorithm

- 原文链接: [A fast 3D collision detection algorithm](https://cairno.substack.com/p/improvements-to-the-separating-axis)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44510282)

This article talks about a new, faster way to detect if two 3D shapes are colliding. The main idea is to improve the Separating Axis Test (SAT) used in games and physics engines.

The author explains that SAT checks if two convex shapes touch by testing many possible separating directions (axes). Usually, these directions come from the faces and edges of the shapes. The author noticed that if you use the Gauss map—a way to show all face normals on a sphere—it’s possible to find which faces or edges matter for collision, and skip many extra calculations. You don’t need to check every axis with a slow “support function” (a way to find the farthest point in a shape along a direction). Instead, you can do one full support check, then walk across the “graph” of the Gauss map, updating your answer cheaply as you move to new regions.

The author goes into detail about how the SAT works for both 2D and 3D shapes. They show that the hard part of the problem happens at the “kinks” in the support function, which are found at the face normals of the shapes. By moving from region to region on the sphere, you only have to do heavy math once—then you cheaply update your answer as you go. The article also shares practical advice: use a half-edge data structure to keep track of faces and edges, sort your edges well, and be careful with the shape quality for best results.

Tests show that this new method is 5–10 times faster than the old SAT if your shapes have lots of faces. For shape vs triangle, it’s about 1.2 times faster. The author also built a demo you can try. There are some small bugs left, but they can be fixed.

In the comments, many people are excited about the speed boost and want to try the code. Some note that this could really help in games and 3D modeling tools. Others ask about problems with edge cases, shapes with many faces, or floating-point errors. A few share that similar ideas have been used in other physics engines, but this version is clearer and easier to follow.

Some readers like the new “optimization” way of thinking, instead of just geometry. Others say the article is a bit math-heavy, but the code helps them understand. A few worry about handling special cases, like flat or very thin shapes. Some want more details about how to build the hulls and keep them “clean” for the algorithm.

A couple of commenters share links to old papers with similar ideas and ask if the author knows about them. Others mention that in real games, the biggest speed gains come from skipping checks when shapes are far apart, not from optimizing the SAT itself. Still, most agree that this is a clever and useful improvement, and they hope to see it in more open-source projects.

## Would You Like an IDOR With That? Leaking 64m McDonald's Job Applications

- 原文链接: [Would You Like an IDOR With That? Leaking 64m McDonald's Job Applications](https://ian.sh/mcdonalds)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44513940)

This article talks about a big security problem found in McHire, the job application system used by most McDonald’s restaurants. The writers tested the system after seeing people complain online about its chatbot giving strange answers.

They found two serious issues: first, the admin login used a very weak default password—just “123456” for both username and password. Second, there was a security flaw called an “IDOR” (Insecure Direct Object Reference) in the system’s API. This allowed anyone with access to an account to see the personal details of any job applicant, just by changing a number in the web address.

The job application process included a chat with a bot named Olivia and a personality test with simple questions. The researchers tried to trick the chatbot but found it was locked down. However, by logging in as an admin using the weak password, they could see how the system worked from the restaurant’s side.

While looking at candidate data, they discovered that by changing the “lead_id” in the API request, they could see the information of any of the 64 million people who had applied for a job. This included names, email addresses, phone numbers, addresses, work preferences, and chat messages. They realized this was a huge privacy problem.

The writers quickly tried to contact Paradox.ai, the company running McHire, even though it was hard to find the right people. Once the company was reached, they fixed the problems fast and promised to check for other issues. The article includes a clear timeline showing how quickly the company responded.

In the comments, many people were shocked that such weak passwords were allowed for admin accounts. Some said that using “123456” shows very poor security practices, especially for a company handling so much personal data. Others pointed out that IDOR problems are common and often missed because they are easy to overlook in testing.

Some readers blamed the use of third-party systems and chatbots for making security risks worse, saying companies should build better, more secure tools. Others felt that the fast response from Paradox.ai was good, but worried about all the personal data already leaked. A few questioned why such systems need so much information from job applicants in the first place. Some developers said that finding and fixing these bugs should be a bigger part of software development. There was also talk about how hard it is to report bugs to big companies, and how security researchers sometimes get ignored. Finally, people debated if companies like McDonald’s should be punished for these mistakes, or if fast fixes are enough.
