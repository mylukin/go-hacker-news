Hello everyone, this is the 2025-10-01 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have three stories for you: a new AI model for time series data, the October “Who is hiring?” thread, and an article about how top performers use daily life as practice.

First, let’s talk about OpenTSLM, a new kind of AI model that is getting attention. OpenTSLM is made for time series data, such as heartbeats or stock prices. In our world, a lot of information changes over time, but most AI models today are not good at understanding these patterns. OpenTSLM introduces something called Time-Series Language Models, or TSLMs. These models are special because they can work with both text and time series as their main focus. This means you can use natural language to ask questions about patterns, get explanations, or make predictions about things that change step by step.

The team behind OpenTSLM says their models are much better at understanding events in order, and they do not need as much computer power as older models. There are two main types of OpenTSLM: open base models trained on public data, and advanced models for special business needs. The open models are free, so any developer or researcher can use them. The advanced models are more powerful and can be used in fields like healthcare, robotics, or managing big systems.

The creators come from top universities and tech companies. Their goal is to help AI make better decisions by understanding time, not just text or images. They hope TSLMs will become a universal tool, helping in many fields by letting AI see how things change over time.

In the comments, many people are excited about this idea. They say AI models that work with time series could help in health monitoring, finance, and controlling machines. Some are curious about how TSLMs compare to older models like LSTMs or transformers, and if they really work better. A few users wonder if the free models will be strong enough for real problems, or if only the paid versions will be useful. There are also questions about the data: how much is public, and how much is private? Some people want to know if there will be good tools and guides for using the models. Others warn against too much hype and want to see real results first, since working with time series has always been hard. One comment points out that mixing time series with text is a new idea, and it could open new ways to understand data. Overall, most people are hopeful but careful, waiting to see if OpenTSLM can really deliver.

Next, let’s look at the monthly “Who is hiring?” thread on Hacker News. This is where companies and startups post job openings for October 2025. It’s a big event for job seekers in tech and for employers looking for talent. The thread starts with a simple question: who is hiring, and for what roles? Many companies reply, listing jobs for software engineers, product managers, designers, and data scientists. Some companies are large and famous, while others are startups. Jobs are offered in many places—some are remote, some are in certain cities, and some let you work from anywhere. Each post tells you what the company does, what kind of person they want, and how to apply. Some mention salary or benefits, while others ask you to email for more details. A few companies want very special skills, like machine learning or low-level systems programming. Others welcome people with different backgrounds or even those looking for their first tech job.

Because the thread is long, many users use keywords or search tools to find jobs that fit them. In the comments, people share tips, like applying quickly because good jobs get many applicants. Some remind companies to include clear details—location, salary, and remote options—to help job seekers. There is also talk about how the job market is changing. Some see more remote jobs, while others notice more contract work. People give advice on how to stand out, saying you should write a short, clear resume and show real code or projects. Some discuss age bias or the hard parts for newcomers in tech. Others thank the thread for helping them find jobs before. A few warn about scams and say to check companies before sharing personal information. Overall, the thread is very active and full of practical advice for both employers and job seekers.

Our third story is about how top performers get better by making practice part of their whole life, not just during official training times. The article starts with the story of Sofia Polgar, a chess champion who practiced everywhere, even on the bathroom floor at night. Her family trained hard, but much of her progress came from playing and thinking about chess outside of normal practice. The article says people often think talent is the main reason for success, but the real secret is practice—even small bits of practice during daily life.

The writer gives more examples. George Orwell, the writer, practiced by making up stories in his head all day, even though he hated writing. The physicist Richard Feynman taught imaginary students while walking. Chess master Bobby Fischer played chess in his mind everywhere, even using ceiling tiles as chessboards. These people did not just practice at set times—they turned daily life into practice.

The article then gives tips: look for small ways to practice that need no tools, like thinking through problems in your head. Use waiting time to imagine perfect performance, like athletes do. Mix practice with chores or walks. Build habits that let your mind work on your skill in the background. Finally, use limits or odd situations to find new ways to practice, like shadowboxing while dancing.

In the comments, some readers love the idea and share their own ways to sneak practice into daily life, for things like coding, music, or languages. Others say it is not easy for everyone, and some people may get tired if they try to practice all the time. Some say you cannot force yourself to love something enough to practice everywhere, and rest is also important. A few wonder if this idea works for all skills—maybe for sports, official training is still key. Most agree that finding more ways to practice, even in small ways, can help people improve faster.

That’s all for today’s episode. Thank you for listening to Hacker News Daily Podcast. See you next time.
