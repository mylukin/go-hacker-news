Hello everyone, this is the 2026-01-04 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we bring you stories from the world of software, tech culture, and some curious moments from both the law and the café.

Let’s start with a strange event from North Dakota. The state passed a new law to help develop critical minerals, but someone added two fake minerals—“friezium” and “stralium”—to the law. These names seem to come from the last names of two coal industry lawyers, Christopher Friez and David Straley, who worked on the bill. Both lawyers say they did not add the fake names, and no one knows who did. Some people think it was a joke, a mistake, or maybe someone wanted to embarrass the lawyers. The Agriculture Commissioner found the fake minerals while preparing for a meeting and said it could be embarrassing for the state. The fake minerals were added very late, just before the bill passed, when lawmakers were rushing. The main sponsor, Rep. Dick Anderson, said he didn’t add them and wishes he had checked better. The staff who prepare the laws said they just use what lawmakers send them and are not experts in minerals. Earlier, another fake mineral, “docterium,” named after another lawmaker, was caught and removed before the bill passed. The president of the coal industry group called this an unfortunate mistake, but said the main goal—developing real critical minerals—is still very important.

People in the comments had mixed reactions. Some found the story funny and were surprised that fake names made it into a real law. Others saw it as a sign that lawmakers do not always read or understand what they are voting on, which worries them. There was talk about how easy it is for mistakes or jokes to end up in official documents when work is rushed. Some pointed out this shows why careful review is important before passing new laws. A few users wondered if this kind of thing happens more often than people know. Others felt embarrassed for North Dakota and said it could make the state look bad. Some thought it was just harmless fun, while others thought it showed bigger problems in government. Finally, a few joked that “friezium” and “stralium” should now be real elements in the periodic table.

Next, we look at a new tool for AWS users called “taws.” Taws lets you view and manage AWS resources right from your terminal. It gives a fast, keyboard-driven way to browse things like EC2, Lambda, S3, and many other AWS services, without using the web console. The idea is to make AWS work feel more like using Vim or k9s for Kubernetes. Taws supports switching between different AWS profiles and regions easily. You can work with over 94 resource types from more than 60 AWS services, like starting or stopping EC2 instances straight from the terminal. The tool gives real-time updates, and you can refresh views with a single key. Navigation uses keys like “j” and “k” to move up and down, and “:” to pick resource types. You can filter resources by name, view details in JSON or YAML, and use autocomplete to find things quickly.

It is easy to install on macOS, Linux, or Windows, with pre-built binaries or by using Cargo if you have Rust. You need to have your AWS credentials set up, and your account must have enough permissions to see the resources. The README shows key bindings, supported services, and how to configure the tool. If you need a service that is not supported, you can ask for it to be added. The project is inspired by k9s and built with Rust libraries.

In the comments, some people are excited about having a fast, terminal-based way to manage AWS, saying it feels less heavy than the web console. Others wish there were more tools like this for cloud platforms, and they like the Vim-style navigation. A few point out that tools like this are great for people who live in the terminal and want to avoid using a mouse. Some mention similar tools, like “aws-nuke” or “aws-tui,” and compare features. One person warns about being careful with commands that can destroy resources, suggesting a “confirm” step for dangerous actions. Another asks about security and if it supports session tokens or MFA. There are questions about extending support to more AWS services. A few users mention that while this is great for individuals, many companies still use strict permissions and may not allow such tools, but others say it’s great for small teams and indie hackers. Overall, people are positive and interested to see the project grow.

Now, a story about coding from a phone using cloud tools and AI. The writer explains how they do all their coding work from an iPhone, using Termius to connect to a rented cloud VM. The VM is only paid for when used, about $0.29 per hour, and is protected by Tailscale, firewalls, and fail2ban. The writer uses mosh for stable sessions and tmux to keep multiple coding tasks open. Each Claude Code agent runs in its own tmux window, so the writer can work on many features at once. Push notifications tell the writer when Claude needs input, so work can continue without staring at the terminal. The VM is kept safe from production, and the cost is limited—even if something goes wrong, the loss is small. The setup works from anywhere: while waiting for coffee, on a train, or watching TV. Parallel development is easy using git worktrees and different ports for each feature branch.

In the comments, people are impressed with the clever use of mobile and cloud tools. Some praise the security choices, like Tailscale and firewalls. Others point out that mosh and tmux are great for keeping mobile sessions alive. A few ask about battery life and typing speed on a phone, saying it might be hard to do serious work without a real keyboard. There are questions about the cost—some think $7 a day is good for flexible work, while others wish for even cheaper options. Some worry about trusting Claude with code changes, but agree the VM isolation helps. A few hackers share their own setups, like coding on iPads or with portable keyboards. Others wonder if this could work for larger teams, or if it’s best for solo developers. Many like the push notification trick, saying it helps make async work feel smooth. Overall, readers find the approach interesting, practical, and a good example of remote, flexible coding in action.

Moving on, we have an article about personality change. The writer wanted to see if they could change their own personality in six weeks, using new psychology research. They started with a personality test and found themselves high in neuroticism and openness, strong in conscientiousness, average in agreeableness, and low in extraversion. Old research said personality is fixed by age 30, but new studies show people can change traits if they try. The writer did daily meditation, gratitude journaling, met new people, practiced kindness, and tried to relax perfectionist habits. Some activities felt awkward at first, like making small talk or saying positive things, but got easier. Meditation helped calm their mind. After six weeks, the writer felt more sociable and less anxious. Retaking the personality test, their extraversion and agreeableness went up, and neuroticism dropped. Their partner, who didn’t try to change, stayed the same. The writer notes that real change is possible, but it takes effort and desire.

Hacker News commenters have mixed reactions. Some are impressed that research now supports the idea of changing personality and like the “fake it till you make it” approach. Others are skeptical, saying that six weeks is too short and test results might just reflect a good mood or recent events, not real change. A few point out that personality tests are not always reliable and can be affected by how you feel that day. Many agree that small, daily actions—like talking to strangers or keeping a journal—can really help people grow. Some share their own stories of becoming less shy or anxious over time by pushing themselves into new situations. There is debate about how much of personality is “hardwired” versus shaped by experience. Some users say lasting change is slow and takes years, while others believe that even small improvements can make life better. A few warn that trying too hard to change might cause stress or make someone act inauthentic. Overall, most commenters think being open to change and trying new things is a good idea, even if results are not huge or fast.

Next, we have 21 lessons from 14 years as a Google software engineer. The author says being a great engineer is not just about code—it’s about solving real user problems and working well with people. Start simple and ship your work, even if it’s not perfect. Clear and simple code is better than clever code because others need to understand it later. Only use new tools when you really need them; they add work in the future. Your code does not speak for you—people do, so make sure others know your impact. Sometimes, the best code is the code you never write. At a big company, even your bugs can become features if users depend on them. If a team is slow, it’s usually because people are not aligned, not because they are lazy. Focus on what you can control. Abstractions just hide complexity—they don’t remove it. Teaching others helps you learn better. “Glue work” like documentation and helping others is important, but it can be invisible, so make it noticeable. Winning every argument can cause silent resistance from your team. Metrics can be gamed, so use more than one to get a real picture. Admitting what you don’t know creates a safer team. Your network at work is more valuable than any single job. Most speed improvements come from removing extra work, not making things more clever. Good processes help reduce risk. As you get older, time becomes more important than money. There are no shortcuts to learning, but small improvements add up.

In the comments, many people agree these lessons are important, especially for engineers moving from junior to senior roles. Some say advice about focusing on people and communication is the hardest to learn, but the most valuable. Others point out the lesson about only using new technology when needed, saying too much novelty causes problems later. Some share stories about trying to be the smartest in the room but now focusing more on teamwork. “Glue work” is often overlooked in promotions, and some wish companies would reward it more. A few discuss the point about metrics, sharing examples of chasing the wrong numbers. Others say that their best job offers came from old connections. Finally, some readers say that admitting what you don’t know is freeing and helps teams grow. Most find the lessons helpful and honest.

Now let’s talk about linear least squares fits and why regression lines sometimes look “off.” When you use ordinary least squares (OLS), the method tries to make the vertical distances between data points and the line as small as possible. This means it only cares about errors in the y-direction. The line always goes through the average point, but may not follow the main direction where the data spreads out the most. The article compares this to principal component analysis (PCA), which points in the direction where the data has the biggest spread. If you draw a line along this direction, it often looks more “central” to the data. OLS and PCA do different things: OLS gives the best guess for y if you know x, while PCA is about the overall shape of the data. There’s also “total least squares” (TLS) or “orthogonal regression,” which treats errors in both x and y. This method usually gives a line closer to the main axis of the data cloud, matching what people often expect.

In the comments, some point out that OLS is supposed to work this way—it’s not really “biased,” just doing what it’s designed for. Others say our brains like to see the “main axis” as the best fit, which is why the OLS line can look wrong to us. Some suggest using total least squares or Deming regression if you want a line that fits the overall data shape, not just y given x. Others add that if you fit x as a function of y, you’d get another line, and both cross at the mean point, but neither matches the “main axis” unless the data is very special. People discuss that OLS is popular because it is simple and matches many real-world problems where x is not noisy, but sometimes you need a more symmetric method. In short, the “bias” is not a bug, but a feature of how OLS works. If you want a line that matches your visual sense of the data’s direction, you should look at total least squares or PCA methods.

Next up, a story about AI chatbot security. Eurostar’s public chatbot was found to have serious security problems. The chatbot uses a REST API, sending the whole conversation history with every new message. The server checks only the newest message with a “guardrail” for safety, but does not re-check older messages. If the latest message passes, it gets a special signature; if not, it returns a fixed, polite refusal. The server does not check if older messages were changed, or if the chat and message IDs are correct. Four main problems were found: You could bypass the guardrails by making the last message harmless and changing earlier messages to do something bad. Prompt injection could reveal secret prompts or details about the AI model. The chatbot would show any HTML it received, so an attacker could make it run code in the user’s browser. The server accepted any chat or message IDs, even fake ones, without checking. None of these bugs allowed access to other users’ data, but they could become dangerous if the chatbot is given more power in the future.

Reporting these issues was hard. The researcher emailed Eurostar but got no answer for weeks. When they tried LinkedIn, Eurostar told them to use the same process that had not worked. Later, Eurostar even suggested they were being blackmailed, though no threats were made. The problems were finally fixed, but the process was slow and confusing.

In the comments, some say this is a classic example of old web security mistakes showing up in new AI tools. They point out that adding AI does not remove the need for basic checks like input validation and server-side controls. Others are surprised that companies still miss these basics. Some commenters think the guardrail design was too trusting of the client. A few developers share similar stories of vulnerability disclosure going badly or being ignored by companies. Some defend Eurostar, saying it’s hard to manage security as products change quickly, and that outsourcing disclosure programs can cause confusion. Others remind everyone that if the chatbot ever handled personal data, these bugs could have been very serious. Many agree that companies should treat AI features just like any other part of their website—do the basics well and test often. Finally, a few people note how important it is for companies to have clear, working channels for security reports and to respond quickly and politely.

Now, a story from classic video games. In Street Fighter II, the subtitle “World Warrior” was misspelled as “World Warrier” right before the game shipped. The main graphics designer, Akiman, found the error too late—the graphics chip had already been made, so the art could not be changed. Akiman could still change how the game displayed things using the code, but not the pictures. He tried to cover up the mistake by layering other pieces of art on top of the wrong letter to make the “e” look like an “o.” He borrowed tiles from the word “World” and swapped them in, making the title read “Warrlor.” But now the “l” looked wrong—it was supposed to be an “i.” Akiman used a small piece of another character’s sprite—Guile’s leg—which had just one pixel. By using the right color palette, he placed this tiny tile over the “l” to make a dot. This is why, for years, the “i” looked a bit strange in the logo. Later versions fixed the art, but the subtitle was changed anyway, so the new tiles were never used.

In the comments, some readers were impressed by the creative solution, saying it showed real problem-solving skills under pressure. Others joked about how many people must have seen the title and not noticed the odd-looking “i.” Some said they work in games and know how last-minute fixes like this are part of the job. A few wondered why nobody caught the typo earlier, while others pointed out that hardware limits in old games often led to these kinds of clever workarounds. Some shared similar stories from their own projects. A couple of people also expressed respect for the attention to detail and the effort to fix even small errors, even when time was short. Some said this story made them appreciate the art and effort behind classic games even more.

Next, let’s talk about modern memory systems. The writer explains that while old computers used simple, straight memory spaces, new systems keep adding layers and fixes to stay compatible, making things much more complex and slow. On CPUs like Apple’s M1 and IBM’s s390x, every new generation adds more extensions and buffers. This makes the original, clean design hard to see and work with. Both ARM and x86 CPUs suffer from this, especially when translating virtual addresses to physical ones. Modern systems use many levels of page tables, making memory access slower and sometimes causing strange errors. The reason for linear address spaces is mostly history—early computers needed them, and we keep using them for compatibility. The author gives an example from history: the Rational R1000 computer, which used a different system—memory was an object cache, not a linear space. Each memory address was really an object plus offset, and the hardware handled types and data together. This made things fast and safe, even with 64-bit addresses, and the design was used in defense systems.

He then talks about new ideas like CHERI, a project from ARM and Cambridge University. CHERI makes pointers and integers different in hardware, so you can’t turn data into an address by mistake. This would have prevented about 43% of Microsoft’s reported security problems in 2019. The author says that linear address spaces are unsafe and that we need hardware protections like CHERI, or even better, a return to object-based memory like the R1000.

In the comments, some people agree that modern memory management is too complex and risky. They like the idea of object-based memory and hardware-enforced safety. Others think that changing to new memory models is too hard because of all the old software that expects linear addresses. Some point out that object-based systems have their own problems, like making debugging and low-level programming more difficult. A few mention that while ideas like CHERI are good for safety, they might slow down programs or make hardware more expensive. Several readers discuss how much of this is due to the need for backward compatibility. They say that most users don’t care about these details as long as their programs work. Some believe that strong software tools and safe programming languages would solve most problems, so changing hardware isn’t needed. Others worry that adding more hardware safety could lead to new kinds of bugs or security issues if not done carefully. Overall, many people want better, safer memory systems, but see big challenges in changing how computers work.

Finally, let’s end on a quiet note. One article talks about the happiness of sitting alone in a café without a phone, laptop, or other distractions. The writer spends some days just walking with their dog and sitting in a café, trying to slow down and enjoy the moment. At first, they feel nervous and anxious, but soon start to feel free. They find not being able to contact anyone or look things up helps their mind relax. Drinking coffee slowly from a porcelain cup, instead of rushing with a paper one, feels special. The writer pays attention to the café’s sounds, the people, and the staff’s routines. They start to see details they never noticed before, like how people worry or how the staff talks to regular customers.

Sitting alone also makes the writer think about how we can’t control what others think about us. Being alone in public can feel scary, but also powerful—others may be curious or even a bit jealous of this quiet joy. The writer also tries writing by hand in the café. Using a pen and paper, instead of typing, forces them to slow down even more. It feels challenging but rewarding.

In the comments, many people share their love for sitting alone in cafés. Some say it’s a great way to relax and watch life happen. Others talk about how hard it is to disconnect from phones, but agree it’s worth it. A few mention feeling self-conscious at first, but getting used to it over time. Some users point out that cafés are not just for groups—many people go alone to read, think, or just enjoy the atmosphere. Others say that being alone in a public place can make them feel connected to the world, even without talking to anyone. Some people like to write or draw while sitting alone, just like the author. Others say they miss this kind of slow, peaceful time because their lives are so busy. A handful of users worry about being judged or seen as lonely, but most agree that it’s a small price to pay for the joy of quiet and reflection. Some even say they have made friends or met interesting people while sitting alone in a café. Overall, the comments show that many people value quiet time alone, even in busy places, and that being alone does not always mean being lonely.
