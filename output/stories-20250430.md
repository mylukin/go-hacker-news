The article talks about downloading all of Hacker News using a custom tool. The author created a new tool to collect data from Hacker News, even though other tools exist, for the fun of using new programming features in Go.

The tool can download all posts and comments, which are called "items," from the beginning of Hacker News to now. The author managed to download about 20 GiB of data. They then used DuckDB, a fast database tool, to analyze the data. DuckDB made it easy to perform queries, like checking how often specific programming languages are mentioned over time. They used SQL to find trends in mentions of languages like Python, JavaScript, and Rust.

In the comments, some people were impressed by the project and interested in the technical details. Others discussed the ethics and potential uses of such a large data set. A few were worried about privacy and the implications of having all this data in one place. Some also joked about the idea of replacing human content with bot-generated text. Overall, the project sparked curiosity and a mix of technical and ethical debates.

The article talks about how SentinelOne, a cybersecurity company, deals with different types of cyber threats. It focuses on attacks from nation-state actors, like North Korean IT workers, ransomware groups, and Chinese state-sponsored hackers. These threats target cybersecurity companies like SentinelOne because compromising them can provide access to many other networks and systems.

The main points of the article include SentinelOne's experience with North Korean IT workers pretending to apply for jobs to infiltrate the company. They use fake identities and applications to try and gain insider access. SentinelOne has developed systems to detect and interact with these fake applicants to gather intelligence and stop infiltration. They also face threats from ransomware groups that aim to access and abuse their security platforms. These groups often use social engineering to gain access to security tools. Another threat comes from Chinese state-sponsored actors targeting SentinelOne's infrastructure and their clients. The article highlights the importance of sharing threat intelligence across teams and using automation to detect and block suspicious activities.

In the comments, users discuss different aspects of cybersecurity and the challenges companies face. Some find the article more like a marketing piece for SentinelOne, mentioning that it suggests hiring them for protection. Others discuss the broader issue of cybersecurity, like the difficulty of securing operating systems and the role of data diodes. There's also mention of high-security environments requiring thorough background checks. People also talk about the use of front companies by adversaries to acquire security tools for malicious purposes. Some users express skepticism about the effectiveness of current security measures and discuss the importance of continuous improvement in cybersecurity practices. The conversation reflects a mix of technical insights and opinions on the state of cybersecurity today.

Xiaomi's MiMo project is all about creating a small, powerful language model designed for reasoning, especially in math and code. They introduced MiMo-7B, which is a model series focused on reasoning tasks, and claimed it even outperforms some larger models. The MiMo-7B models use a mix of pre-training and post-training techniques to boost their reasoning abilities. Pre-training involves optimizing data and generating synthetic reasoning data, while post-training uses a large set of curated math and code problems to fine-tune the model. The models are available for free, and Xiaomi hopes they will help the wider community.

In the Hacker News comments, one user was interested in how Xiaomi used unit testing during training, which is a method to ensure code problems are solvable. Another commenter asked why many Chinese companies create English-first AI models, questioning if it’s because English is the main language for AI benchmarks. Some noted that English is the most common language in the datasets used for training these models. A few users discussed how English has become the main language for scientific research and AI work. There was also curiosity about how Xiaomi managed to create such a strong model with only 7 billion parameters, as it performs well against much larger models. A discussion emerged about the challenges of creating a good language model in Chinese due to the closed nature of the Chinese internet, and whether the language's complexity adds difficulty in training models.

## Linux in Excel

A new GitHub project lets you run Linux inside Microsoft Excel using a tool called LinuxInExcel. This project uses an emulator called mini-rv32ima, which is loaded as a DLL by a VBA macro. The macro calls the emulator, gets the output, and writes it into Excel cells. This setup is more of a fun experiment rather than a serious tool, and it's noted to be quite buggy. The creator mentions that the emulator wasn't rewritten in VBA or Excel formulas, which might be seen as a shortcut.

In the comment section, there's a mix of humor and curiosity. Some users joke about embedding different AI models in Excel cells, while others recall similar quirky projects like running Doom in unexpected places. A few commenters express disappointment, expecting the project to use Excel cells themselves as a computational platform, rather than just displaying output from an external emulator. There’s also a discussion about Excel's limitations, with a few users noting that Excel doesn't run the same on different platforms like Windows or Mac, and it can't run on Linux directly. A user humorously suggests running Excel on Linux in Excel, while others reminisce about other surprising uses of Excel or similar projects. Overall, the comments reflect a playful appreciation for the creativity and novelty of running Linux in an unexpected environment like Excel.
