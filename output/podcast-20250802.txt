Hello everyone, this is the 2025-08-02 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have seven stories to share, covering electric trucks, AI coding tools, road safety, a programming book club, YouTube video archiving, changes at AnandTech, nuclear fusion, and a new open-source graphics editor.

Let’s get started.

Our first story is about the Telo MT1, a new small electric truck designed for city life and weekend trips. The MT1 is about the size of a MINI Cooper but can carry as much as a Toyota Tacoma. It uses modern electric technology and safety features, with a five-seat cab and a five-foot bed. You can change the bed to carry large items like plywood sheets or add more seats for up to eight people. The truck is quick, going from 0 to 60 mph in 4 to 5 seconds, and offers up to 350 miles of range on a single charge. It has a 106 kilowatt-hour battery that can fast-charge from 20% to 80% in about 20 to 30 minutes. The MT1 is small—just over 12 feet long—but the bed can be extended. It can carry up to 2,000 pounds and comes in two-wheel or all-wheel drive.

On Hacker News, many users like the idea of a small, city-friendly electric truck. Some say it’s good to see a truck that is not so big, while others worry about safety because it is much smaller than most trucks. People ask about price, battery life, and whether the company can really build the truck at scale. Some users discuss the simple design—some like it, while others think it is too plain. The flexible seating and bed get a lot of praise, especially for families and city use. There are questions about towing and if the MT1 can really replace larger trucks. Some compare it to other electric trucks and wonder if it will succeed in a market where most buyers still want bigger vehicles. A few users point out the risks for the company in such a tough industry. Overall, people are interested but cautious, hoping Telo can deliver on its promises.

Next, we look at a developer’s six-week experience using Claude Code, an AI coding tool, at Puzzmo. The author says Claude Code has changed how he works, making it faster to handle big tasks like updating libraries or fixing tech debt. Instead of writing every line by hand, he tells the tool what he wants, reviews the output, and makes changes. This lets him try out ideas quickly, write tests, and build prototypes. Using two code clones, he can work on several things at once.

Claude Code is especially useful in game development at Puzzmo, where designers can get a working prototype online in just a few hours. The tool is even used live during meetings to test quick fixes. The author says Claude Code is best for people with some coding experience and works well with modern codebases. He notes it’s hard to measure speed by lines of code, but the feeling of progress is much higher.

For safety, he sometimes limits what the tool can do, but often lets it run with fewer checks. He suggests junior developers use Claude Code as a learning partner: write their own code first, then compare and learn. Side projects are now much easier, as tasks that once took a weekend now take just a few hours. Claude Code is not perfect—it struggles with tasks that need memory or big-picture understanding—but it helps a lot.

In the comments, readers are excited about the speed and freedom this tool brings. Some compare it to how photography changed painting. Others worry about over-reliance on AI and the risk of not learning the basics. Many agree that experienced engineers are still needed to review and guide the tool’s output. There are questions about security, project fit, and whether hiring will change to focus more on people who can manage and guide AI. Most agree that tools like Claude Code are changing programming, but skill and judgment are still key.

Our third story is from Helsinki, where the city has gone a full year with zero deaths from traffic accidents. This is the first time Helsinki has reached this goal, and city officials say it comes from years of planning and safer streets. Speed limits are now mostly 30 km/h, especially near schools. Roads are safer for walking and cycling, with new layouts and more police patrols. Public transport is good, so fewer people need to drive. Cars are also safer.

In the late 1980s, Helsinki had about 1,000 injuries and up to 30 deaths from traffic accidents each year. Last year, there were only 277 injuries and no deaths. The city uses good data to plan, and special rules protect children, cyclists, and walkers. Electric scooters are controlled by speed limits, parking rules, and signs. This all fits with the EU’s “Vision Zero” plan for no deaths by 2050.

Hacker News users are surprised and impressed. Many say it shows what cities can do with real effort. Some point out that lower speed limits and better street design work better than blaming drivers. Others ask if this could work in bigger cities or if Helsinki is special because of its size and good public transport. Some wish their own cities would follow Helsinki’s example, while a few doubt it would be easy. Overall, the comments are positive and hopeful about making streets safer.

The next story is about a book club reading “The Art of Multiprocessor Programming, 2nd Edition.” This classic book covers building software for computers with more than one processor. The club will read one chapter each week and discuss by email—no video calls. Each week, one member starts the talk with a short email, and others reply. The goal is to share real experiences, not just repeat the book. Anyone can join, but a Google account is needed.

In the comments, many call the book a classic for learning about multicore programming. Some note the code is in Java, but the ideas work in any language. A few wish the club used a more open platform. Others share tips for reading, such as building the code yourself or finding extra resources online. Group discussion is seen as helpful, and the organizer says all levels are welcome. Some suggest other books, but most agree this is the best place to start. People are excited and supportive, with some worried about keeping up, but others think the pace is good.

Our fifth story is about a Firefox extension and a local Go backend for saving YouTube videos. The extension detects when you visit a YouTube video page, grabs the video ID, and sends it to the backend. The backend uses yt-dlp to download the video and ffmpeg to convert it to MOV format. It can also download English subtitles, though this is still being improved. Most downloads happen automatically, but you can also use a popup to check or start downloads.

To use it, you run the backend with Go, install the extension, and visit any YouTube video. Videos are saved to a folder on your computer. The system depends on yt-dlp, ffmpeg, and Go.

Hacker News users like the idea, saying it is useful for archiving talks, courses, or news videos, since YouTube videos can disappear. Some raise privacy and legal questions, as downloading videos may break YouTube’s rules. Others worry about disk space and suggest features like skipping ads, handling playlists, or choosing formats. Some ask about support for other browsers or sites. There are concerns about making it easier to use and keeping the backend secure. Many users suggest improvements, such as better subtitle support or using Docker for setup. Overall, comments are positive, and people see this as a good tool for personal archiving.

Next, we have news about AnandTech. The main AnandTech website now redirects all visitors to its forums, instead of the usual tech news and reviews. The forums are still active, with many sections for discussing hardware, software, deals, and more. Topics include CPUs, graphics cards, displays, laptops, networking, and even health and cars. The community is large and active, even though the main site content is gone. AnandTech is owned by Future plc, a big media company.

On Hacker News, many are sad or worried about this change. Some say AnandTech’s reviews were the best for learning about hardware in detail, and feel it is the end of an era. A few are glad the forums are still running, since they hold much old knowledge. Others wonder if AnandTech will close for good, or if this is just temporary. Some blame the new owner for not caring about tech journalism. A few hope someone will archive the old reviews. Others point out this is another example of good sites dying after being bought by big companies. But some users are glad the community can keep going in the forums.

Our sixth story is about Helion, a company backed by Microsoft, which has started building a nuclear fusion power plant in Washington state. The new plant, called Orion, may be the first fusion plant to connect to the electric grid. Microsoft has agreed to buy up to 50 megawatts of electricity from Helion by 2028, helping reach its goal of being carbon negative by 2030. Helion’s seventh prototype, Polaris, aims to be the first to generate electricity from fusion. Earlier, their Trenta prototype hit 100 million degrees Celsius, needed for fusion. Helion has raised over $1 billion from investors, including Sam Altman from OpenAI, and is valued at $5.4 billion. The company still needs final permits, but says they are on track. Other companies, like Google, are also interested in fusion.

On Hacker News, some people are excited and see this as a big step for clean energy. Others are doubtful, as fusion has been “almost ready” for decades. Some wonder if the 2028 date is too optimistic. There are questions about Microsoft’s deal and if it is a real bet or just a show of support. Some users want to know how Helion’s technology is different from other fusion companies. Others talk about the need for more government support and warn that fusion could change the energy market. The comments show hope, caution, technical curiosity, and business interest.

Our last story is about PixiEditor 2.0, a new free and open-source tool for editing all kinds of 2D graphics. PixiEditor is called “universal” because it lets you work with raster images, vectors, animations, and procedural effects in one app. Its main feature is the Node Graph, which lets you connect layers and effects like building your own mini image processing pipeline. You can switch between painting, pixel art, and vector modes, with each vector in its own layer for easy editing. Animation is built in, with both classic frame-by-frame and procedural options. You can export animations as videos or sprite sheets.

PixiEditor 2.0 also introduces paid extensions and a “Founder’s Pack” to help fund the project, but the base editor stays free and open-source. The new version needs a Vulkan-compatible GPU and a 64-bit system, but you can use version 1.0 if your computer can’t run it.

Hacker News users are excited to see an open-source competitor to apps like Photoshop and Aseprite, especially for new workflows mixing vectors and raster art. The Node Graph feature gets praise for its power and flexibility. Animation improvements are popular, as frame-by-frame and procedural animation in one tool is rare. Some worry about the hardware requirements, but most understand it is needed for advanced features. The funding model also gets support, with users glad the core is free and extras can help support the project. Some hope for even more features in the future. Overall, the mood is supportive, and many plan to try or recommend the new version.

That’s all for today’s episode. Thank you for listening to the Hacker News Daily Podcast. We hope you found these stories interesting and useful. See you next time!
