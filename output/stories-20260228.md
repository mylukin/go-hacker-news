Obsidian Sync now has a headless client, so you can sync your notes without opening the Obsidian desktop app. This is helpful for servers, scripts, or when you want to automate backups or updates for your notes.

The article explains how to set up the headless client using a tool called “obsidian-headless,” installed with npm. You need to back up your files before starting and should not use both the desktop app and headless sync on the same device, or you might get data conflicts. After installing, you log in, list your remote vaults, and set up syncing for a local folder. You can run a one-time sync or let it run all the time to watch for changes. For automatic jobs, like in CI pipelines, you can use an authentication token instead of logging in by hand.

There are commands to list remote vaults, list local vaults, create new vaults (with options for encryption and region), and set up syncing between local and remote vaults. You can control which files and folders to sync, set conflict rules, and even decide which kinds of files (like images or PDFs) to include. There’s a command to check sync status and another to unlink a vault when you’re done. On Windows and macOS, a special addon keeps file creation dates correct, but this doesn’t work on Linux.

In the comments, many people are excited because they wanted a way to sync notes from the command line, especially for servers or scripts. Some say this helps with automation and makes it easier to include Obsidian in big workflows. Others mention that it’s great for people who want to back up or copy their notes often, or for teams who share notes and want to keep everything up to date.

A few users worry about data conflicts if people are not careful about using the desktop app and headless sync together. Someone points out that the tool needs an Obsidian Sync subscription, so it won’t work for everyone, especially those who use free syncing tools. Some wish there was support for Linux file creation times, but most agree this is a small problem. There are questions about security and how end-to-end encryption works in scripts, but others reply that you can set passwords and manage encryption in the setup. In general, the community sees this as a big step forward for power users and people who like to automate their note management.

## The happiest I've ever been

- 原文链接: [The happiest I've ever been](https://ben-mini.com/2026/the-happiest-ive-ever-been)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47161759)

The article is about someone who felt happiest when coaching a youth basketball team, not while working in tech. The writer finished college, got a job, but felt empty even after trying different things like side projects and socializing. They found meaning by volunteering to coach kids in basketball. The job was real work—planning practices, helping kids improve, and leading the team with a friend. The team did well, but the big reward was seeing the kids grow in skill and confidence. The writer enjoyed being in control, working with kids in person, and sharing their love of basketball. They noticed that helping others and doing things in the real world made them much happier than sitting at a desk moving “rectangles” (meaning doing tech work on a computer). The article ends with advice: write down what makes you happy, then ask why.

In the comments, many people agree with the writer. They say helping others, teaching, or coaching has brought them more joy than their tech jobs. Some share stories about volunteering, saying it gave them purpose and helped them meet new friends. Others point out that tech jobs can feel empty, especially as AI and automation change the work. A few people warn that not everyone can leave tech or do coaching, since bills still need paying. Some think the real lesson is to look for meaning in any job, not just outside of tech. One person says you can still make tech work feel meaningful if you focus on helping people, not just building products. Another says it’s important to do things in the real world, like sports or hobbies, to balance screen time. Some readers feel sad that modern work is so often disconnected from real life. A few mention burnout and say stories like this help them rethink what matters. Others encourage readers to try new things if they’re feeling stuck. Many thank the writer for the honest story and say it inspired them to reflect on their own happiness.

## MinIO Is Dead, Long Live MinIO

- 原文链接: [MinIO Is Dead, Long Live MinIO](https://blog.vonng.com/en/db/minio-resurrect/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47200342)

MinIO, a popular open-source object storage tool, has stopped being maintained and its code repository is now archived. But the story does not end there — someone in the community has brought MinIO back to life by forking the project.

The original company behind MinIO slowly shut down the open-source side over the last few years. They changed the license, took away features, stopped sharing binaries and Docker images, and finally made the code read-only. This upset many users since MinIO was trusted by thousands and used in many systems.

But because MinIO was licensed under AGPL, anyone is allowed to copy and change the code. So, the author forked MinIO, fixed security issues, restored the full admin console, and set up new ways to download the software (including Docker images and Linux packages). The admin console, which was removed from the free version, is now back. Documentation that was being lost or redirected to paid products has also been saved and updated.

The new fork does not add new features. Its goal is to keep MinIO stable and working, with bug and security fixes, for people who need it in production. The fork is tested in real systems, so problems are noticed and fixed quickly. The author says that with modern AI tools, one person can now manage a complex project like this more easily than in the past.

Trademark issues might come up (since “MinIO” is a company name), but the fork is clearly marked as independent. If there are legal problems, the name will change.

MinIO’s story shows how open-source software can survive even after a company stops working on it. As the article says, “just fork it” — the community can keep important tools alive.

In the Hacker News comments, many users are sad and frustrated about MinIO’s shutdown. Some say the company made a big mistake by closing off the open-source project, especially after getting so much help from the community. Others are glad to see a fork already active, showing the true power of open source and AGPL licenses. A few point out that depending on a single company for important software is always risky; this is a reminder to check licenses and backups.

Some commenters discuss how easy it is now to fork and maintain software with new automation and AI tools. Others wonder if the new fork will last, since keeping up with security and bugs is still hard work. A few worry that trademark issues could cause confusion, but most agree that as long as the project is clearly marked, it should be fine.

Several users compare this story to other projects that were forked after company changes, like Terraform and OpenTofu, and say that forks are sometimes even better than the original. Some hope that more people will help maintain the new fork, while others thank the author for acting quickly and sharing everything with the community.

Overall, the comments reflect disappointment with MinIO Inc., respect for the open-source fork, and a reminder that open-source licenses protect everyone’s right to keep good software alive.

## Verified Spec-Driven Development (VSDD)

- 原文链接: [Verified Spec-Driven Development (VSDD)](https://gist.github.com/dollspace-gay/d8d3bc3ecf4188df049d7a4726bb2a00)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47197595)

This article talks about Verified Spec-Driven Development (VSDD), a method to build software where every step is checked and proven, mixing spec-driven, test-driven, and verification-driven approaches. The goal is to make sure code is correct, safe, and easy to trust, especially when using AI in the process.

First, VSDD says you must write a clear and complete spec before any code. This spec explains what the software should do, how it should behave, and what must be provable—like what is safe, secure, or correct. It also lists edge cases and non-functional needs, such as speed or memory limits. Next, the spec must be reviewed by both humans and an AI acting as a strict critic. Only when the spec is solid can you move on.

Second, developers write tests before code—this is the test-driven part. All tests should fail at first, proving there's no code yet. Then, you write just enough code to make each test pass, step by step. After the code works, you clean it up, always making sure the tests still pass.

Then comes the adversarial step: another AI, acting as a tough reviewer, checks the code, tests, and spec for mistakes, missing parts, or anything unclear. This AI is told to be negative and find every possible problem, with a fresh look each time.

If problems are found, you go back and fix the spec, tests, or code, repeating the steps as needed. Once the code passes all tests and reviews, formal verification tools are used to prove that the most important parts work as promised. Fuzzing, security checks, and test mutation are also run to catch hidden bugs.

VSDD also requires full traceability: every line of code must connect back to a requirement in the spec, with a reason for why it exists. The method is high-overhead but is best for software where mistakes are costly—like in banking, medicine, or security.

In the comments, many people liked how VSDD tries to bring strong guarantees and checks to software. Some said this process is similar to what happens in high-assurance or safety-critical fields, like aerospace. Others thought the method is too heavy for most projects, saying it takes too much time for simple apps or prototypes. A few pointed out that most teams don’t have time or knowledge for formal verification, and that the tools can be hard to use.

Some readers liked the idea of using AI for both building and reviewing code, but worried about AI missing subtle problems or about over-trusting automation. Others liked the focus on clean separation between pure code (easy to check) and code with side effects (like I/O), saying this helps testing and correctness. There were also questions about how well this process works in real teams, with changing requirements, and if people would really follow it all the way.

A few said the process could be a good fit for open-source projects or for teaching better habits, but that it is hard to enforce in fast-moving startups. Some were excited by the traceability idea, as it helps debugging and maintenance. Others warned that too much ceremony can slow teams down or make people skip steps. Finally, some readers said even if you don’t use all of VSDD, just using parts—like strict test-first and adversarial reviews—could help most teams write better code.

## Addressing Antigravity Bans and Reinstating Access

- 原文链接: [Addressing Antigravity Bans and Reinstating Access](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/discussions/20632)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47195371)

Gemini CLI users were recently blocked because of "Antigravity bans," which happened when people tried to use third-party tools or proxies to get around service rules. The Gemini team now says all affected accounts will be unbanned soon, and they are making a new process so people can fix account problems themselves.

The article explains that bans happened because of how Antigravity checks for rule-breaking, which also blocked access to Gemini CLI and Gemini Code Assist. The team is now doing an automatic unban, so most people should get access back in a day or two. In the future, if your account breaks the rules, you’ll get a clear email and an error message with a link to a Google Form. You have to read the terms again and promise to follow them. If you do this, your account should be back within two days. But if you break the rules again, your account will be banned forever.

The rules are strict: don’t use other software or services to trick Gemini CLI’s login system or bypass usage limits. The team says this new process is fair for users who made a mistake, while keeping the service safe.

In the comments, some users are glad the bans are being lifted, but many still have worries. Some think the rules about third-party tools are not clear enough and want better explanations. A few users feel that open tools like OpenClaw and OpenCode are being unfairly targeted, while others point out these tools often cause problems or low-quality content. One user says paying customers were banned without warning and wants better support, clearer rules, and a real way to appeal bans.

Others ask if using Gemini with other tools or APIs is allowed, and some complain that Google’s usage limit info is confusing—so third-party tools are needed to track it. Some people say the new system is fair and should have been in place sooner, but others are upset that bans can affect their whole Google account, not just Gemini. A few users warn that banning without warning is dangerous and makes developers not want to use Google services.

One strong opinion says it’s wrong for Google to ban people from programming tools so quickly, and that there should be more warnings and human support. Another comment compares this to “right-to-repair” and says if you pay for a service, you should be able to use it how you want. Some users say they will stop paying for Gemini because of these strict rules, while others suggest using other models or services instead. There is a lot of debate about what is fair, what is safe, and how much control a company should have over how users access their tools.

## Werner Herzog Between Fact and Fiction

- 原文链接: [Werner Herzog Between Fact and Fiction](https://www.thenation.com/article/culture/werner-herzog-future-truth/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47178051)

This article talks about the filmmaker Werner Herzog and how his movies mix real facts with made-up stories. Herzog is famous for making both documentaries and fiction films, but sometimes it is hard to tell which is which.

The article says Herzog often changes real events to fit his story. He thinks feelings and ideas are more important than just showing what happened. For example, in his movie “Grizzly Man,” he uses real video from Timothy Treadwell, but adds his own voice to shape the story. In “Fitzcarraldo,” Herzog filmed a real boat going over a mountain, but not all the details are true. He even said he “invented” some truths, because he wants to show a deeper meaning instead of just facts. Herzog calls this “ecstatic truth”—something that feels more real than real life. He does not like the word “documentary” because he thinks it limits what a movie can do. Herzog’s movies often make people think about what is real and what is not. He believes art can show truth better than a camera can. The article gives examples from his other movies, like “Aguirre, the Wrath of God” and “Lessons of Darkness,” where he mixes fact and imagination.

In the comments, some people say Herzog’s style is special and makes his movies interesting. Others worry it can be confusing if viewers do not know what is real. One person likes how Herzog makes people feel strong emotions, even if the story is not all true. Another commenter says it is okay to change facts if it helps share a bigger idea. But some think documentaries should not mix facts and fiction. There is a discussion about “ecstatic truth”—some find it powerful, others find it misleading. A few fans share their favorite Herzog moments and quotes. Some remind that many movies, not just Herzog’s, blur the line between truth and fiction. One person says it is important for viewers to think about what they are watching, instead of just believing everything. Another commenter adds that Herzog’s movies make them curious to learn more about the real events. Overall, people agree Herzog’s films are unique, but they do not all agree on whether mixing fact and fiction is good.

## New evidence that Cantor plagiarized Dedekind?

- 原文链接: [New evidence that Cantor plagiarized Dedekind?](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-man-who-stole-infinity-20260225/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47154637)

The article says that new letters were found showing Georg Cantor plagiarized Richard Dedekind’s work about infinity and set theory in an 1874 math paper. For a long time, Cantor was seen as the hero who proved there are different sizes of infinity, changing mathematics forever.

The story starts with mathematician and journalist Demian Goos, who searched for old letters in Germany. He found a lost letter from Dedekind to Cantor from 1873. This letter shows Dedekind’s ideas and proofs appear almost word-for-word in Cantor’s famous paper. Before this, history mostly credited Cantor alone, even though he and Dedekind worked closely and shared ideas by letter.

Cantor and Dedekind both redefined the number line and worked on the nature of real numbers. They met, discussed, and became friends. Cantor was fast and eager to publish, but Dedekind was quiet and careful, sharing his ideas only when he was sure. In 1873, Cantor asked Dedekind for help. Dedekind answered with proofs and suggestions, which Cantor then used in his paper—without giving Dedekind credit.

Cantor’s main trick to get the paper published was to hide the radical idea about infinity behind a safer result about algebraic numbers. He was afraid of criticism from other mathematicians, especially Kronecker, who hated the idea of actual infinity. So, Cantor published the paper alone, using Dedekind’s ideas but erasing his name.

Later, Dedekind privately wrote that he saw his own work in Cantor’s published paper. The two stopped talking for years. Even after they started writing again, Cantor kept using Dedekind’s ideas without giving credit, and their friendship never fully recovered. Over time, Cantor became isolated and struggled with depression, even as his work slowly became famous.

The lost letter found by Goos is important because it gives real proof that Dedekind’s work was used by Cantor without credit. Until now, historians only had Dedekind’s private notes and later disagreements about what really happened. The article says it’s time to recognize Dedekind’s role in the discovery, not just Cantor’s.

In the Hacker News comments, some people are surprised that such a big math story was misunderstood for so long. Others say it’s common for science history to make one person the “hero,” even when the truth is more complicated. A few think Cantor’s actions were wrong but also say the math itself is what matters most in the end. Some users mention that even with the new evidence, Cantor’s main theorem about the size of infinity was still his own, while Dedekind’s proof was about something less radical. Yet, many agree that credit and honesty are important in science.

There is also debate about whether Cantor really meant to steal or if he was just caught up in the rush to publish and the pressure from other mathematicians. Some users point out that Dedekind didn’t go public with his complaint, which might mean he accepted the situation. Others think the new letter changes everything and that future math books should give both men more recognition.

People also discuss how math, like other sciences, is made by real people with flaws, not just by ideas. Some say this story is a reminder to be careful with credit in research today. A few hope this will lead to more interest in Dedekind’s life and work, which many feel has been ignored. Overall, readers are interested in how history, personality, and the search for truth all mix together in the world of mathematics.

## Woxi: Wolfram Mathematica Reimplementation in Rust

- 原文链接: [Woxi: Wolfram Mathematica Reimplementation in Rust](https://github.com/ad-si/Woxi)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47155526)

Woxi is a new project that re-creates the Wolfram Language (used in Mathematica) using the Rust programming language. The goal is to let people use Wolfram-like scripts and notebooks without needing the official Wolfram software.

The main idea is to give users a fast, free, and open way to use the Wolfram Language. Woxi can run scripts from the command line, much like the original WolframScript tool. It also works inside Jupyter Notebooks, showing both text and graphics, and even has a demo that runs fully in your browser. The project tries to support as many Wolfram Language functions as possible and has a test suite to make sure results match the real thing. Woxi is much faster to start than WolframScript because it does not check licenses or launch a heavy kernel. You can install it easily using Rust’s package manager, cargo, or by building from the code. The project lists all supported functions in a CSV file, so users can check what works. Woxi is released under the AGPL-3.0 license and welcomes help from other developers. For people who want to use Woxi in notebooks, there are clear instructions to install the kernel and start Jupyter Lab. The code is mostly written in Rust, with some parts in other languages for notebook support.

In the comments, many people are excited to see a free and fast version of the Wolfram Language. Some say this could help students and researchers who cannot afford official licenses. Others point out that re-creating the whole language is a very big job, because Wolfram Language is complex and has many special cases. A few users share that they have tried similar projects and found that matching all functions and graphics is hard. Some ask if Woxi can run big math problems or create advanced plots yet. There are also worries about legal issues—some wonder if Wolfram Research will be upset about this open project. One person notes that Woxi’s use of Rust could mean better performance and safety. Others say they hope to see more open-source math tools like this in the future. Some users compare Woxi with other projects like Mathics, and they are interested to see which one will become more complete. A few people mention that having Jupyter support is very useful for teaching and sharing work. Finally, several comments thank the creator and say they will try out Woxi soon.

- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47195123)

This article shares a tool called “Now I Get It,” which turns scientific papers (PDFs) into easy-to-read, interactive web pages. The tool helps people understand complex research by explaining it in plain language and making it more visual and shareable.

You can upload a scientific PDF, and the tool will give you a link to a web page that summarizes and explains the paper’s main ideas. It breaks down hard concepts, uses simple words, and sometimes adds interactive elements to help you learn. The web pages are designed so anyone can understand, not just experts. The article shows examples from different topics, like AI, medicine, math, and biology. Some pages summarize famous papers, while others explain new research. This can be helpful for students, teachers, or anyone who wants to learn but finds scientific writing confusing. The tool also allows you to share the link with friends or on social media, so more people can learn from it. It is free to use and does not need you to sign up. The goal is to make science more open and easy for everyone.

In the comments, many people say this tool is very useful, especially for students and people outside science. Some like that it helps lower the barrier to understanding new research. Others worry about errors or missing context when summarizing complex science in simple words. A few ask about privacy—what happens to the PDF after upload? Some users wish it could handle more file types, like Word or LaTeX. There are requests for more features, like adding notes or asking questions about the paper. One person says this could help journalists report on science better. Another points out it may not always get the science right, so people should be careful and check the original paper. Some say it is good for quick reading, but not for deep study. Others compare it to AI tools and wonder if it uses AI or human editors. A few teachers say they will try it with their students. Some users hope more languages will be added in the future. Overall, most comments are positive and excited about making science easier to understand.

## Block the "Upgrade to Tahoe" Alerts

- 原文链接: [Block the "Upgrade to Tahoe" Alerts](https://robservatory.com/block-the-upgrade-to-tahoe-alerts-and-system-settings-indicator/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47198977)

The article explains how to stop macOS from nagging you to upgrade to the new “Tahoe” version and remove the red alert badge in System Settings. The author dislikes the new look and some changes in macOS Tahoe, so they want to stay on an older version (Sequoia) without constant reminders to update.

To fix this, the author uses a device management profile—a tool usually for companies to control Mac updates. With this, you can block major macOS upgrades for up to 90 days. The author found a project called “Stop Tahoe Update” on GitHub. It gives you a ready profile to do this. The steps are: download the project, make the scripts executable, edit the profile file to add unique IDs, and (optionally) change a setting so only major updates are blocked. Then, run a script to install the profile. After that, you must finish the setup in System Settings under “Profiles” and click to install. This will block the “Upgrade to Tahoe” message and the red badge for 90 days. After 90 days, just repeat the process. The author made it easier by adding a shortcut command in their terminal setup. This way, they can quickly reinstall the block every 90 days.

In the comments, people thank the author for the guide and share extra tips. Some point out that the 90-day block is based on the release date of the update, not when you install the profile, so you may need to keep updating the block if new versions come out. A few users note that sometimes the alerts are more aggressive in newer macOS updates. One commenter explains that the profile sets a rule, and it’s always active as long as it’s installed, but sometimes Apple’s bugs or changes can affect how well it works. Someone asks if there’s a way to keep getting minor Sequoia updates but hide only the Tahoe upgrade. Another user worries that updating to a newer minor version might fix the bug that lets this block work. There’s also talk about wanting a similar solution for iPhone updates. One commenter shares a video link showing another way to turn off update alerts. Overall, many people are happy to find a way to control these reminders, but some wonder how long the trick will keep working or if Apple will close the loophole.
