Hello everyone, this is the 2026-01-09 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have a mix of stories about creative coding, science tools, new tech demos, and even some thoughts about kindness and health. Let’s get started.

First, let’s talk about Dwitter.net. This is a website where people write tiny JavaScript programs called “dweets.” Each dweet must fit in just 140 characters, but even with this limit, people make amazing visual effects and animations in the browser. Most dweets start with “function u(t)” and use clever tricks to draw moving shapes, flags, or even popcorn emojis on a canvas. Some code is so compressed that it’s hard to read, but the results are fun to watch. Users can share, remix, and comment on each other’s dweets. There are monthly challenges, like making something with a “cavern” theme. Dweets are sorted by “hot,” “new,” or “top,” so you can see what’s trending.

In the Hacker News comments, many people are impressed by how much can be done in so little code. The limits push people to be more creative and solve problems in new ways. Some say it’s easy to learn new JavaScript tricks just by reading dweets. Others like how you can just run a dweet in your browser and see the animation right away. There’s also talk about how hard it is to understand the code, since it’s so packed. A few worry this style encourages “code golfing” over clear code, and some wish the site explained each dweet. But most agree that the mystery is part of the fun. Dwitter reminds people of the old “demo scene” days, when coders made cool effects with very little code. Overall, it’s seen as a great way to play, learn, and explore what JavaScript can do.

Next, there’s a new C++ library called QtNat for Qt 6. It helps your app open router ports using UPnP, making it easier for programs to connect to the internet without users setting up routers by hand. QtNat finds routers with UPnP, asks them to forward ports for your app, and tries to make it all simple with a clean API. The library sends a search request to find routers, asks for the router’s info, looks for the right device in the XML, and then sends a request to open a port. If it works, your app is connected; if not, it quits and reports the error.

Hacker News users are excited to see a new, modern Qt-based UPnP library, since older ones are often hard to use or not maintained. But some warn that UPnP is often turned off for security reasons, so this method may not always work. There’s talk about the risks, since any app could open ports without asking, and some routers don’t follow the standard well. People also ask if the tool can remove port mappings, not just add them. Others discuss testing on different routers and networks, and like that the code is open source with a GitHub page for contributions. A few users warn to always check what apps are opening ports on your network.

Switching to science, researchers in South Africa have found the oldest known poison on arrow tips—about 60,000 years old. The poison, likely ricin from plants, was found on stone points, showing that ancient people used chemicals to hunt animals. The poison would make animals weak or kill them, even if the arrow didn’t hit a vital spot. This discovery means people back then were very smart, using plants in new ways. Scientists used special tools to find tiny traces of poison stuck in cracks on the stones.

In the comments, people are amazed by the cleverness of early humans. Some say it shows how smart people were long before farming or writing. There’s talk about how hard it must have been to find the right plants and use them safely. A few wonder if poison was also used in wars, and others compare poison arrows to old tools like traps and spears. Some people are surprised the poison lasted so long, and others think this helps us understand more about early human survival.

Now, let’s look at a fun hardware experiment: can you play PC games on a Raspberry Pi 5 with a giant graphics card, like the NVIDIA RTX 5090? The writer compared the Pi 5 to two other small computers—a Beelink MINI-S13 with Intel CPU and a Radxa ROCK 5B ARM board. The Pi 5 can use an external GPU with a special dock and driver patches, but it’s the slowest, with the least bandwidth. To run PC games on ARM boards, you need a tool called FEX, which makes ARM look like Intel but slows things down.

The writer tested games from Cyberpunk 2077 to Portal 2. Most modern games don’t really run on the Pi, but older games from 2010–2012 sometimes work, though with low frame rates. Portal 2, using its native Linux version, runs well. The Pi uses little power, but performance is much lower than the Intel Beelink. In the comments, people liked the experiment for fun, but many said it’s not useful to pair a $2000 GPU with a $70 Pi. Some hope ARM gaming will get better as the hardware improves. There’s lots of talk about how tools like FEX and Proton slow things down, and that the CPU is the real bottleneck. Many agree this is a cool hack for learning, but a normal PC is still best for real gaming.

Moving on, there’s a new Rocket Launch and Orbit Simulator you can try online. The tool lets you launch rockets, watch the numbers for speed, fuel, and altitude, and practice getting into orbit. You can control the rocket manually or let the computer fly it for you. There’s also an “orbital mode” to practice moving rockets already in space. People on Hacker News found the simulator fun and a great way to learn about rocket launches and orbits. Some want more features, like different rocket types or real-world locations. Others like how it can be used in classrooms. A few talk about the math behind the tool and how it shows why real rocket launches are so hard. Most people thank the creator for a simple, fun way to play with rockets and orbits.

Next, there’s a web tool that lets you turn a photo into a simple 3D scene using machine learning. The tool uses Apple’s SHARP model to guess depth from a single image, making a “3D Gaussian Splat” so you can move around the picture in 3D. You just upload a photo, and the tool predicts how far things are and shows the image as a cloud of dots in 3D. Everything runs in your browser using open-source Apple code.

Hacker News users are excited by how easy it is to get 3D effects from one photo. Some say it’s fun to see pictures “pop out,” but note the 3D effect is best for some scenes. A few worry about privacy, but others like that nothing is sent to a server. Developers explain how SHARP works and discuss possible uses for games or VR. Some wish the tool could handle more complex scenes or let you edit the results. Most find it impressive and easy to use, even as a demo.

Now, let’s talk about building a Michelson interferometer at home for very little money, using mostly 3D-printed parts and cheap items from Amazon. This science device can measure tiny changes in distance using light. The author used a 3D printer for most parts, solved the mirror mount problem with springs and screws, and shared all files and instructions on GitHub. The device splits a laser beam in two, sends it to mirrors, and brings it back together. Changes in distance show up as patterns of light you can see.

In the comments, people like how cheap and simple the design is. Some share ideas for making it even cheaper, like using CD pieces as mirrors. Others talk about the physics behind the device and ask about stability. Many say it’s a great beginner project, and some suggest adding electronics or sensors. There are reminders to be careful with lasers. Most readers like the open-source files and easy instructions, saying it’s inspiring for science learning.

Another story is about “Lend Me Your Ears,” a web game that helps people learn to play piano by ear. The game plays some notes, and you try to play them back, either on a real MIDI keyboard or on-screen piano. It gets harder as you improve, like a “Simon” memory game with piano sounds. The goal is to help people practice listening and playing without reading music.

People on Hacker News like the idea, saying they always wanted to learn to play by ear. Some like that you can use a real keyboard, and others share tips about ear training. There are calls for more features, like more instruments or hint systems. Some mention that ear training can be slow and boring, but games like this keep it fun. Most are happy to see more music learning tools online.

Switching to a softer topic, we have an article about small acts of kindness and how they can feel like miracles. The author shares stories of hitchhiking and traveling, where strangers helped him in many ways—giving rides, food, or a place to stay. He says that being open to help, being a “kindee,” is important, and that both giving and receiving kindness is part of a good life. He calls this attitude “pronoia,” believing the world is working to help you.

In the comments, people share their own stories of kindness. Some say it’s harder to find now, while others think kindness is everywhere. There’s debate about safety and trust, and some say technology has changed how we help each other. Many like the idea of being a better “kindee” and want to be more thankful in daily life.

Finally, there’s a story about how exercise can help people with depression almost as much as therapy. Scientists looked at studies and found that regular, light to moderate exercise can lower depression for many people. Exercise worked about as well as therapy, and almost as well as medicine, but the proof for medicine was not as strong. The best results came from 13 to 36 sessions, mixing different activities and adding some strength exercises. Injuries were rare, and exercise is cheap and safe for most.

In the comments, people agree that exercise helps mood, but know it’s hard to start moving if you’re very depressed. Some say exercise should not replace therapy or medicine if you need more help. There are calls for making exercise easier for everyone, like better parks and more free time. Some warn against telling people to “just exercise,” since it can sound uncaring. Overall, people agree exercise is good, but it’s not always easy or enough by itself.

That’s all for today’s episode. Thank you for listening to Hacker News Daily Podcast. We hope you enjoyed these stories and ideas. Please join us again tomorrow for more news and discussions from the tech world. Have a great day!
