- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43913705)

A Japanese private lunar lander, named Resilience, has entered lunar orbit and plans to land on the moon in June. The lander, by the company ispace, carries a mini rover to collect and study lunar soil. This mission follows recent U.S. private lander successes earlier this year.

The article highlights how SpaceX launched Resilience alongside Firefly Aerospace's lander in January. Firefly landed on the moon without crashing, marking a milestone for private space endeavors. In contrast, ispace's first lander attempt in 2023 ended in a crash. This new mission aims to improve on past mistakes and achieve a successful landing. The rover on board will perform scientific tests, including analyzing lunar dirt.

In the comment section, users discuss various aspects of the mission and space exploration. Some note the importance of learning from past failures, like ispace's earlier crash, and hope for cultural improvements within the company. Others question the openness of scientific research from private companies compared to NASA's public approach. There's intrigue about the moon's unique position in space, allowing for solar eclipses, which some users find amazing and rare. Discussions also touch on cultural aspects, like the naming of the lander and the influence of Japanese mythology. Finally, users reflect on the broader implications of private versus public space exploration and how state support influences these projects.

These comments show a mix of technical curiosity, cultural insights, and concerns about the future of space exploration. Each perspective adds depth to the discussion about the ongoing advancements in lunar missions.

- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43943236)

The article discusses a tool called "Gmail to SQLite" that lets users download their Gmail emails and store them in a SQLite database. This tool is useful for analyzing emails, like checking the number of emails from each sender or identifying large emails. To use it, you need to follow a setup process involving Google Cloud and OAuth credentials. It allows syncing all emails or just individual messages into a SQLite database. The data structure uses tables with fields like sender, recipients, and message body stored as JSON, allowing for flexible querying.

In the comments, some users discuss technical aspects, like the decision to use JSON for storing certain email headers. Some suggest using SQLite's ability to index expressions directly for better performance. Others mention the challenges of using Google's API, noting that getting OAuth credentials can be complex and time-consuming. Some suggest using IMAP with app passwords as a simpler alternative, though others point out that this option is increasingly hard to access. There's also discussion about the broader issues with Gmail, such as privacy concerns and the difficulty of moving away from Google services. Users share their experiences with alternatives, like hosting their own email servers or using other email services, emphasizing the trade-offs between convenience, privacy, and control.

## Internet Roadtrip: Vote to steer

- 原文链接: [Internet Roadtrip: Vote to steer](https://neal.fun/internet-roadtrip/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43912618)

The article talks about a fun internet game called "Internet Roadtrip" where people can vote on which direction a virtual road trip should take, using Google Street View. The game lets users steer the journey by voting, creating a shared online adventure. 

The main idea is that players can vote in real-time to decide whether the virtual car should go straight, turn left, or right. This involves multiple people voting together, and their collective decision determines the path. The game uses Google Street View, which can be expensive because every vote might mean a new image is loaded from Google's servers, costing money per view. Some users suggest smarter ways to handle the images, like caching them to save on costs, but there are concerns about whether this is allowed by Google's terms of service.

In the comments, users have a lot of fun discussing the concept. Some mention the high cost of Google’s Street View API and suggest caching to save money. Others compare the game to an old idea where passengers on a bus could vote on the route. There are also suggestions for improving the game, like adding a history of past votes or making it possible to pre-load images for smoother transitions. People enjoy the creative aspect of the game, suggesting it brings "Twitch energy" to the web. Overall, it's seen as a clever and entertaining idea, with users sharing light-hearted comments and clever ideas on how to enhance the experience.

## Detect and crash Chromium bots

- 原文链接: [Detect and crash Chromium bots](https://blog.castle.io/detect-and-crash-chromium-bots-with-one-weird-trick-bots-hate-it/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43916622)

The article discusses a bug in Chromium that can crash headless browsers like Puppeteer and Playwright with a simple JavaScript command. The author shows how to use this bug to detect and crash bots without needing a server, but advises against using it in production.

The bug involves using `contentWindow.open` on an iframe, causing the browser to crash. This method can make the bot detection process easy, but it's not practical for real-world use. The article warns against using this approach due to its negative impact on user experience, potential unintended side effects, and the likelihood that bots will adapt. Additionally, executing this strategy on the client side limits access to metadata that could be useful for informed decision-making.

In the comments, users share their experiences and concerns. One user mentions that the bug can cause large memory usage problems on macOS. Another commenter is surprised that this significant bug hasn't been fixed quickly, despite its high priority status. Some users discuss the legality and ethics of crashing bots, comparing it to illegal booby-trapping of homes. Others highlight the challenges of using headless browsers due to anti-bot measures by websites. A few comments mention alternative browser automation solutions that avoid these issues, such as using real browsers instead of headless ones. Overall, the community offers various perspectives on the practical and ethical implications of using such a tactic against bots.

The article "Slow Software for a Burning World" discusses Bonfire's approach to creating software with care and community involvement. Bonfire is nearing the release of version 1.0, focusing on building resilient, meaningful, and slow software, contrasting with the typical fast-paced Silicon Valley model. Bonfire aims to create digital spaces where communities have the power to shape their environment, emphasizing long-term sustainability over rapid growth.

The article criticizes the standard tech industry practices that prioritize profit over people, leading to issues like loss of trust, lack of consent, and environmental harm. Bonfire seeks to address these by adopting values from the Zapatista movement, promoting collective governance, and building flexible systems. The platform is modular, allowing communities to govern and customize their tools. Bonfire's federated design ensures autonomy and prevents corporate capture, staying true to its mission by avoiding venture capital and ads.

In the comments, users express confusion about what Bonfire actually is, with some suggesting clearer communication about its purpose. It's described as a framework for building federated digital spaces, yet many find it unclear whether it's a network or a toolkit. Others appreciate the ideals but find the implementation and documentation lacking clarity. Discussions also touch on political aspects, with some users debating the project's stance on inclusivity and governance. A few commenters reflect on the broader implications of software governance, while others focus on the project's technical aspects and potential benefits over existing platforms like Mastodon.
