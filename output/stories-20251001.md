## OpenTSLM: Language models that understand time series

The article is about OpenTSLM, a new kind of AI model that can understand and work with time series data, like heartbeats or stock prices. Time series are everywhere in the real world, but most AI models today cannot handle them well.

OpenTSLM introduces Time-Series Language Models (TSLMs), which are built to work with both text and time series data as their main focus. These models let you use natural language to ask questions, explain, and make predictions about patterns that change over time. The creators say their models are much better at understanding things that happen in order, and they don’t need as much computer power as older models. OpenTSLM comes in two main types: open base models trained on public data, and advanced proprietary models trained for special cases or business needs. The open models are free for anyone to use, which can help many developers and researchers. The advanced models offer more power and can be used for things like healthcare, robotics, or managing big systems.

The team behind OpenTSLM comes from top universities and tech companies. They believe TSLMs can help AI make better decisions by paying attention to time, not just text or images. Their vision is to create a universal tool that helps in many fields, from medicine to robotics, by letting AI understand events that happen step by step.

In the comment section, some people are excited about the idea of AI models that can handle time series natively. They think this could help in areas like health monitoring, finance, and controlling machines. Others are curious about how these models compare to old methods like LSTMs or transformers, and if they really perform better. A few users wonder if the open models will be enough for real-world problems, or if only the paid versions will be useful. Some ask about the training data—how much of it is public, and how much is private? There is also interest in how easy it will be for developers to use these models, and if there will be good tools and documentation. Others raise concerns about possible hype, saying that working with time series has been a challenge for years, and they want to see real results before getting too excited. One person points out that making time series “multimodal” with text is a new twist, and could open up new ways to interact with data. Overall, most comments are hopeful but also cautious, waiting to see if OpenTSLM can deliver on its promises.

This post is a monthly “Who is hiring?” thread on Hacker News, where companies and startups post job openings for October 2025. It is a place for job seekers in tech to look for new opportunities and for employers to find talent.

The thread starts with a simple question: who is hiring, and for what roles? Many companies respond, listing open positions. These include jobs for software engineers, product managers, designers, and data scientists. Some companies are big and well-known, while others are small startups. Jobs are offered in different places: some are remote, some are in specific cities, and some allow working from anywhere. Each post usually explains what the company does, the kind of person they want, and how to apply. Some posts include a salary range or benefits, while others ask you to email for details. A few companies look for very specialized skills, like machine learning or low-level systems programming. Others are open to people with different backgrounds or even those looking for their first tech job. The thread is long, so many users use keywords or search functions to find jobs that match their skills.

In the comments, people share tips on how to best use the thread. Some say you should apply quickly, because good jobs get many applicants. Others remind companies to include clear details, like location, salary, and remote options, to help job seekers. A few users discuss how the job market is changing—some see more remote jobs than before, while others notice more contract work. There are questions about how to stand out as a candidate, with advice to write a clear, short resume and to show real code or projects. Some people talk about age bias or challenges for newcomers in tech. Others thank the thread for helping them find a job in the past. A few warn about scams and say to check the company before sharing personal details. Overall, the thread is active, supportive, and full of practical advice for both employers and job seekers.

## Increasing your practice surface area

- 原文链接: [Increasing your practice surface area](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/lifestyle/increasing-your-practice-surface-area-agxYGi9bL0gd1WYYQZAu)

This article talks about how top performers get better not just by official practice but by making practice a part of their whole life. The writer gives examples from chess, writing, and science to show how big "practice surface area" helps people reach world-class skill.

The story starts with Sofia Polgar, a chess champion who practiced everywhere, even on the bathroom floor at night. Her whole family trained hard, but a lot of her improvement came from playing and thinking about chess outside normal practice times. The article says many people think talent is what makes someone great, but often the real difference is how much they practice, even if they don’t notice. Some people fill their free time with small bits of practice, like thinking about guitar chords during a bus ride or solving chess puzzles in their head before bed. This is called increasing your "practice surface area"—finding more moments in your day to practice, even when you’re not in a “real” session.

The writer gives more examples: George Orwell hated writing, but he practiced by making up stories in his head all day. Physicist Richard Feynman taught imaginary students while walking, turning every moment into a lesson. Chess master Bobby Fischer played chess in his mind everywhere, and even used ceiling tiles as chessboards. These people didn’t just practice during set times—they turned daily life into practice.

The article then gives tips for readers: Find small ways to practice that need no tools, like thinking through problems in your head. Use waiting time to imagine perfect performance, like athletes do. Mix practice with chores or walks. Build habits that let your mind work on your skill in the background. Finally, use limits or odd situations to make new ways to practice, like a fighter shadowboxing while dancing.

In the comments, some readers love the idea and share their own ways to sneak practice into daily life. They say it works for things like coding, playing music, and learning languages. Others point out that not everyone finds this easy, and some people may get tired or burned out if they try to practice all the time. A few say that "obsession" is hard to force—you can’t always make yourself love something enough to practice everywhere. Some suggest it’s important to rest and reflect too, not just practice non-stop. Others wonder if this method works for every skill; for things like sports, they think official training is still very important. But most agree that finding more chances to practice, even in small ways, can help anyone get better faster.
