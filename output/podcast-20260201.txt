Hello everyone, this is the 2026-02-01 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have stories about software history, new open-source projects, database engineering, and a few fun tales from tech life. Let’s get started.

Our first story takes us back to the 1980s and a 40-year-old hardware dongle used for copy protection on legacy accounting software. The author helped a friend’s firm that was still running this old software on a Windows 98 computer, but only if a special dongle was plugged into the parallel port. When trying to move the system to an emulator, the software refused to run without the dongle. Luckily, the author found the source code and tools. He used a disassembler and discovered that the dongle check was just a tiny bit of code always expecting the number 7606h in a register. By patching four bytes, he tricked the software into thinking the dongle was always present. This simple patch worked for every program made with the compiler. In the comments, people were surprised at how easy it was to break the protection. Many remembered similar dongles and said most were just meant to stop casual copying, not determined experts. Some enjoyed the “software archaeology” and supported the idea of releasing the old compiler to keep computing history alive.

Next, let’s look at NanoClaw, a tiny personal assistant for Claude AI that runs inside Apple containers on macOS. NanoClaw is about 500 lines of TypeScript, using Linux containers for real isolation. Each agent and task runs in its own sandbox, with no complex layers or big dependencies. It connects to WhatsApp, so you can talk to your assistant from your phone. Each group has its own container and memory, keeping chats and data separated. You can schedule tasks, ask the assistant to change its behavior in natural language, and add new “skills” as small scripts. Setup is done by talking to Claude Code. There are no dashboards or big config files—just chat and code. The project is open source and runs best on macOS, but can be ported to Linux or Windows. Security is strong because each agent is locked in a container and needs permission to touch files. In the comments, people love the small, clear codebase and the use of Apple’s containers. Some wish for support for more chat apps or operating systems. Others discuss the skill system, the no-config approach, and ask about security. Most comments are positive, with many curious to try NanoClaw on their own projects.

Our third story is about the Apple I, and shares an old ad from 1976. The Apple I was a single board computer with a built-in video terminal and 8K RAM, using the MOS 6502 processor. It could connect to a normal TV and keyboard. The price was $666.66, low for that time, and it came fully assembled—no need to build anything. It was quieter, cheaper, and faster than teletype machines, and could display 24 rows of 40 characters. RAM used new 4K chips, and the system could be expanded to 65K. There was a cassette interface for saving and loading programs, and Apple gave away software like BASIC for free or cheap. The ad invited shops to sell the Apple I. In the comments, people were amazed by the price and the technology. Some remembered how exciting it was to use a keyboard and screen instead of switches, and others noted that the price was still a lot in 1976, but much less than the Altair. Many shared nostalgia for the early days of home computing, and admired Apple’s focus on ease of use.

Now, let’s talk about the 1990s. One writer says life then had a better balance between technology and real life. Computers made music better, but didn’t replace real bands. The internet was new and exciting, but it wasn’t the center of life. Most people had simple devices like CD players or game consoles, bought once and used until they broke. There were no subscriptions or endless updates. Photos were special, and life moved slower. Waiting was normal, and people enjoyed things longer. Local businesses mattered, and people had more privacy. The writer misses this balance and feels technology now controls us more than we control it. Many commenters agree, missing the slower, simpler life. Others remind us that nostalgia can make the past seem better than it was, and that technology today brings many good things too. There’s debate about privacy, freedom, and real community, but many wish life could be a bit more like the 90s.

Our next story is about debugging on new hardware. A developer bought an iPhone 16 Pro Max for over $1,000, but found it could not run machine learning models correctly, while his older iPhone and MacBook Pro worked fine. He tried to build an AI expense tracker, but the app gave nonsense answers on the new phone. After days of debugging, he found that the phone’s Neural Engine, or how Apple’s software used it, was broken. The same code worked everywhere else. He traded the phone for a new iPhone 17 Pro Max, which worked perfectly. In the comments, developers were surprised and worried that expensive new hardware could have hidden defects. Some said it’s easy to blame yourself or your code, and this story is a good reminder to check hardware too. There was debate about Apple’s quality control and about how hard it is to debug machine learning problems across devices. Many thanked the author for sharing, saying it might help others in the same situation.

Moving on, let’s talk about Adventure Game Studio, or AGS. AGS is a free, open-source tool for making point-and-click adventure games, with a strong community and lots of help for beginners and advanced users. The games can run on Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android. The forums, Discord, and in-person meetups make it easy to get help and share games. There are many finished games available, including some award winners. AGS also hosts game jams and competitions. In the comments, users praise AGS for helping many people make their first games, and for keeping classic adventure game styles alive. Some wish for a better Linux version or a web-based IDE. Others compare AGS to engines like Godot or Unity, but agree AGS is best for classic adventure games. The scripting language is easy for beginners but powerful enough for complex ideas. The community and focus on adventure games are strong points.

Next, NetBird is an open-source tool for building secure private networks using the “zero trust” model. It uses WireGuard for encrypted connections, and lets you set access rules, check device security, and require MFA. You can use SSO with Okta, Microsoft, or Google, and it works on many platforms, including Docker and some routers. NetBird does not need you to open extra ports or change firewalls, and lets you connect cloud and on-premise servers easily. Detailed logs and device checks improve security. It’s open source and can be self-hosted. Many companies use it to replace old VPNs, saying it’s easier and more secure. In the comments, people like having an open-source alternative to tools like Tailscale, and praise NetBird’s license and self-hosting options. Some ask about scaling and performance for large networks, and others share success stories using NetBird in production.

Now for a story about Kiki, a tool for people who get distracted and want to boost productivity. Kiki helps you focus on one task at a time by blocking all apps and websites except the ones you need. You write down your task, pick allowed apps and sites, and Kiki blocks everything else. You can’t quit early, and it tracks your focus over time. The makers say single-tasking makes people more productive, and share funny stories from users. Kiki costs a few dollars a month and works with Chrome and Safari. In the comments, some people like the strict blocking, saying they need strong tools to stop wasting time. Others think it might be too strict, or not work for everyone. Some point out that self-control is key, and you can’t just use software to change habits. There’s talk about privacy, more features, and support for more browsers. Many share stories about trying similar tools and the challenges of staying focused online.

Next, CedarDB has added a new way to compress text data called FSST—Fast Static Symbol Table. Strings are everywhere in databases, and making them smaller saves space and speeds up searches. Before FSST, CedarDB used dictionary compression, which works well if there are many repeated values. FSST finds common parts of strings, stores them as short codes, and makes the data smaller. CedarDB now combines both methods—using a dictionary and then compressing it with FSST. FSST shrinks storage by 20 to 40 percent, and can make searches much faster when reading from disk, but can slow things down if the data is already in memory. In the comments, people like the clear explanation, and some say they use similar methods. There’s discussion about when to use FSST, the CPU cost, and possible caching strategies. Many appreciate the honest talk about trade-offs, and want to try CedarDB on their own data.

To end today’s episode, we have a fun story about TV remote “wars” in an apartment. The writer and his neighbor both had the same RF remote for Dish Network TV, and the signals went through walls, causing each other’s TVs to change channels or volume. After a rude neighbor refused to solve the problem, the writer started turning off the neighbor’s TV every time it got too loud. Over weeks, the neighbor learned to keep the volume down. The writer calls this “Pavlovian conditioning.” In the comments, people found the story funny and clever, though some wondered if it was fair to “train” a neighbor this way. Others shared stories about interference from wireless devices, and talked about technical fixes. Most enjoyed the creative solution and saw it as a funny lesson about tech and life.

That’s all for today’s Hacker News Daily Podcast. Thanks for listening, and see you next time!
