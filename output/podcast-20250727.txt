Hello everyone, this is the 2025-07-27 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have a rich collection of stories, from developer tools and classic tech history to nature, AI, and even smart home hacks. Let’s get started.

First, let’s talk about Trae IDE, a code editor from ByteDance based on Visual Studio Code. A recent article tested Trae and found it uses a lot more memory and sends much more data back to ByteDance than other editors. When first opened, Trae started 33 processes and used about 5.7 GB of memory, while regular VSCode only had 9 processes and used just 0.9 GB. After people complained, the Trae team updated the app, and now it uses less memory—about 2.5 GB—and has fewer processes, but it still needs more resources than other editors.

The bigger problem is privacy. The test found that Trae continues to send data to ByteDance servers, even when the user turns off telemetry in the settings. Sometimes, turning off telemetry even made it send more data. The data sent includes details about your computer, software, how you use the app, and special IDs that can track you for a long time. Trae tracks how long you use the app, which files you open, and lots of hardware and OS information. All this goes to ByteDance’s servers in China.

The author tried to discuss these issues on Trae’s Discord server but got muted for a week. Later, words like “tracking” were automatically banned, so users could not talk about privacy problems in the community. The author says this shows poor management and a lack of honesty. Telemetry settings do not work, there’s no clear information about what data is collected, and users cannot really say no.

Hacker News users had strong reactions. Many are worried about privacy and do not trust Trae, especially since telemetry cannot be truly turned off. Some say this is not acceptable for open-source tools and will avoid any software from ByteDance. Others point out that the high resource use makes Trae hard to run on older machines. While a few note that most big software companies collect data, almost everyone agrees that ignoring user settings is a big problem. There’s also discussion about trust—can you trust software from companies with a bad history on privacy? Some people focus on the technical side—why does Trae need so many processes, and do the extra features really need so much power? Still, most agree that the main issue is user data and poor community discussion. In the end, the community says clear privacy controls and open talk are very important for any developer tool.

Next, let’s look at Dumb Pipe, a new tool that lets you connect two computers directly, even if they are behind NAT or have changing internet. Dumb Pipe is very simple: you just install it, run it on one computer in “listen” mode to get a secret key and connection string, and then use that string on the second computer to connect and send data. It works like a Unix pipe, but across the world. The tool is a small wrapper around the Iroh Rust library and uses the QUIC protocol. This means connections are fast, encrypted, and can have many streams at once. If a direct connection is not possible, Dumb Pipe uses relay servers automatically. The default relay is free but has limits; you can pay for better relays if needed. For more features, you can add Iroh tools, but then it’s no longer just a “dumb” pipe.

Hacker News commenters liked how easy and direct Dumb Pipe is. They see it as great for quick jobs or when you don’t want to make an account or set up a complex service. Some compare it to SSH, netcat, or Tailscale, but say Dumb Pipe is even simpler. There are questions about security and how the secret key is managed. A few worry about using third-party relay servers for private data, but many are happy the project is open source and uses modern tech like QUIC. People also mention it could help with remote work, debugging, or sharing files with friends. Overall, most users think it’s a handy new tool for developers and network work.

Now, let’s visit the world of smart home hacks. One article shares how two cybersecurity students hacked their cheap “smart” washing machine to get better notifications. The built-in app only sent alerts to one person, but they wanted everyone in the house to know when the wash was done. They noticed their wireless doorbell sent alerts to Discord and thought they could do something similar. Using a special router and network tools, they watched how the washing machine talked online. They found it had an encrypted API that always gave back encrypted data. Guessing the encryption was weak, they found a tool online that quickly revealed the key.

After figuring out which numbers in the data matched washing machine settings, they wrote a script to check the machine often and send updates to Discord when the status changed. Now, anyone in the house can see the washing machine state in Discord. They plan to do the same with other appliances, using smart plugs or sensors for devices that are not “smart.”

People in the comments were impressed with the technical work and creativity. Many liked using Discord for home notifications. Some worried about privacy and smart devices sending data to remote servers, and were glad the authors kept things local. A few warned about hacking appliances in a rental house, which could break the machine or upset the landlord. Some shared stories of hacking other home gadgets and finding poor security, like XOR encryption with a fixed key. Others asked for more details about the Discord bot, and some joked about the “smart home arms race,” where soon everything in the house will be connected to Discord.

Switching gears, let’s talk about the monthly open thread on Hacker News, where people share what they are building or learning. Many are making small web or mobile apps, tools to solve daily problems, or working on AI projects. Others give updates on their indie businesses: SaaS, newsletters, online courses. There are open-source projects, new libraries, and frameworks. Some people are learning new programming languages or doing “build in public,” showing their work online. Posts ask for feedback, co-founders, or beta testers. Some are rebuilding old websites or trying to earn money from their projects. A few are working on hardware or game design, and some beginners are sharing their first steps in coding.

The comments are full of encouragement, feedback, and help. People share tips on staying productive, finding ideas, and avoiding burnout. Some warn that building is only part of the job—you also need sales and talking to users. Many offer to connect or collaborate, making the thread a supportive place for makers and learners.

Next, we have a story from chip history. The article tells how Faggin, an engineer at Fairchild, used a trick called “bootstrap load” to make computer chips faster and use less power in 1970. Normal chips used “resistive loads” that only gave about 60% of the supply voltage. With the bootstrap load, logic gates could reach the full voltage, making chips faster and more reliable. Faggin found a way to make good capacitors on the chip without extra steps, using a “virtual junction,” a clever idea at the time. This, along with another trick called “buried contact,” helped Intel’s 4004 chip come out faster and better than competitors. The article includes old diagrams with Faggin’s notes on where bootstrap loads were used.

Hacker News users enjoyed the technical story. Many praised bootstrap load as a smart solution and were impressed by Faggin’s creative thinking. Some compared it to more complex chip designs from other companies. There was talk about how small technical choices can change the speed of progress. Some wondered if these tricks are still used in modern chips. In general, people liked learning the history and seeing how clever ideas can change technology.

Turning to nature, an article talks about the return of wolves to Yellowstone National Park. After wolves were brought back, aspen trees grew much better. Before, elk ate young aspen shoots without fear, stopping new trees from growing. Wolves changed elk behavior, so elk could not eat aspen shoots as much, giving trees a chance to grow. This is called a “trophic cascade”—one animal’s return changed the whole environment. The return of wolves also helped other animals like beavers and birds that need aspen trees. Scientists watched these changes for over ten years to see the full effect.

Commenters are happy about the return of wolves and the balance in nature. Some say the story is more complex—elk numbers were already going down because of hunting and weather. Others warn not to expect quick fixes in nature and ask if this could work elsewhere. Some worry about how local people feel about wolves. Many are surprised at how much one change can affect everything. Overall, most agree this is an interesting example of nature in balance and science helping to guide decisions.

Now, let’s discuss AI and the internet. An article warns that AI tools like GPT can quickly create huge amounts of fake or low-quality content online. The author says this will make it much harder to find good, real information in the future. AI is now used to write websites, posts, and reviews, making content farms much faster and cheaper. As the web fills with AI-made content, it will be harder to trust or find useful answers. The author calls this an “information virus.” Search engines like Google may have trouble, as they cannot always tell real content from fake. This could make Google results worse, and people might stop using it. The author wonders if this will push people to use new ways of sharing and finding information, maybe even a new kind of “web 3.0.”

The comments show both worry and hope. Some agree that AI will make it harder to find good information. Others say the internet has always had spam and that people will find ways to filter it. Some hope that better tools or smarter search engines will appear. A few worry that if real people stop sharing online, we will lose personal stories and creative work. Others think new, smaller online communities will become more important. Some say Google’s business depends on trust, and losing it would be a big problem. Others think AI can also help find fake content. Overall, people see both risks and opportunities with AI and the future of the web.

Next, we remember Tom Lehrer, the famous songwriter and mathematician, who has died at age 97. He was known for his clever, funny, and sometimes dark songs in the 1950s and 60s, like “The Vatican Rag” and “Poisoning Pigeons in the Park.” Lehrer’s songs used smart humor and catchy tunes. He preferred teaching math at Harvard and MIT over being a star and stopped performing after a few years. He said he liked people buying his records but did not need applause. His songs are still loved today.

In the comments, many shared memories of hearing Lehrer’s music in their youth or at college. Some said his humor made them see smart jokes could be fun. Others said his work still feels new and bold. People admired his choice to leave fame and focus on teaching. Some wish he had written more songs. There was talk about how his songs are still shared online, and some liked how he mixed math and music. Many thanked him for years of laughter and agreed he was a unique and clever artist who will be missed.

Moving on, one article lists many IBM keyboard patents from 1901 to the 1990s. These patents show how IBM and others shaped keyboard and typewriter design. Early patents include the Hollerith keypunch, golfball typewriter head, buckling spring switch, and membrane buckling spring. There are also patents for split ergonomic layouts, key stabilizers, and ways to protect keyboards from spills and damage. IBM keyboards like the Model F and Model M are still loved by many today. The article also mentions patents from companies like Alps and AT&T.

In the comments, people are amazed by the number of patents and IBM’s focus on quality. Some say it is sad that new keyboards do not feel as good as old IBM ones. There is debate about whether patents help or slow progress. Some share stories about using old IBM keyboards, calling them “indestructible.” Others note that ideas like split keyboards were ahead of their time. In general, readers agree IBM’s keyboard designs changed typing and computers, and many wish modern keyboards were made as well as those from the IBM era.

Finally, we look at a workshop teaching people how to use JJ, a new version control system. JJ is made to be fast and easy, using a different design than Git. JJ lets you change commit history in simple ways, even after sharing code, because it stores data in a new way and uses “rebasing” all the time. JJ’s commands are similar to Git but sometimes simpler and safer. The workshop gives step-by-step tasks, like making changes, undoing them, and sharing them.

Comments are mixed. Some are excited about JJ and think it could fix problems found in Git. Others are unsure if it will catch on, since Git is so popular. Some worry about learning new commands or that changing history could be dangerous. Some are happy the workshop is easy to follow and want to try JJ. Others say switching tools is hard in big companies. Some ask how JJ works with old Git projects. Most agree it is good to have choices and hope JJ’s ideas will help all version control tools improve.

That’s all for today’s episode. Thank you for listening to Hacker News Daily Podcast. We hope you enjoyed these stories and discussions. See you next time!
