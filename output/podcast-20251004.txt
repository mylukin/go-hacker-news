Hello everyone, this is the 2025-10-04 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have two stories for you—one about bringing back the spirit of personal blogging, and another about building your own easy solar power kit at home.

Let’s start with the blogging story. The article looks back at the early days of the web, when people shared ideas and stories through personal blogs instead of social media. It explains that anyone can start a simple blog and connect with others using RSS feeds, and you do not need to join any big company platform.

The main idea is that blogging should be easy and casual. You do not need to be a professional writer, and you do not have to worry about making money. You can just share your thoughts, photos, recipes, or anything you want. There are easy blogging services for beginners, or you can set up your own site if you want more control. To follow other blogs, you use an RSS reader. This lets you subscribe to blogs and see all new posts in one place, much like getting a newsletter in your email.

The article suggests making a “feeds page” on your blog, listing all the blogs you follow. This helps others discover new blogs and keeps the network growing. You can even share your feeds using OPML files, making it simple for others to follow the same blogs.

With this system, there is no big company in charge. You just use web standards and connect with the people you want. There is no sign-up, no fee, and no central platform. It is not meant to replace social media, but to offer a slower and more personal way to connect online. If you want comments and conversations, you can use your blog’s comment section, email, or even other platforms—it is all up to you and your readers.

Looking at the Hacker News comments, many people say they miss the old internet and feel that personal blogs and RSS are more honest and friendly. Some point out that RSS never really disappeared—it is just less popular now. A few worry that beginners might find RSS confusing, but others share tips and suggest easy tools to get started.

People also talk about why social media is so addictive: it is quick and easy, while blogs take more time and effort. Some think the web would be better if more people used blogs and shared their feeds, but others are not sure if this will ever become popular again. There are also discussions about how to make commenting and conversation easier across different blogs, and about the pros and cons of self-hosting versus using big platforms.

In the end, many agree that this approach helps people control their own data and avoid big tech companies, but some wonder if enough people care to make it a real movement. Others like that there is no central authority or algorithm to decide what you see. Some users share their own blogs and feeds pages, hoping more people will join this way of sharing.

Moving on to our second story, we have an article about a do-it-yourself solar power kit that you can install for about $912. This kit is made for renters or people who do not want a big, complex system. It is easy to set up, does not need any permits, and lets you use clean energy at home.

The author of the article lists all the parts needed, with prices and Amazon links, showing that the total cost is under $1,000. If you want, you can add parts for remote tracking to see how much energy you make. The system is based on a popular DIY 48V solar setup, and the author shares a guide that helped them build it. This solar kit can make about 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity each year, which could save someone in San Francisco around $550 a year on their electricity bill. That means the kit could pay for itself in about two years.

The article also talks about the energy used to make the solar panels and battery, and how long it takes to “pay back” this energy use with clean power from the system—about three and a half years. The system is safe and legal because it only powers your own devices and never sends power back into the grid. You do need to run extension cords from your devices to the solar box, and then connect the box to your solar panels. If the sun is down and the battery runs out, the system can switch to using power from the wall to keep things like your fridge working. The author also offers help to anyone who wants to build a similar system.

In the comments, some people like the idea because it helps renters or people in apartments use solar power without changing their home or needing permission from a landlord. Others point out that using many extension cords can be messy or unsafe if you are not careful. Some think the payback numbers are too hopeful, because not everyone pays high electricity rates, and real-world energy production can be lower than expected.

A few commenters ask about fire safety and whether the system could trip circuit breakers if too many things are plugged in. Others say that while this is not as good as a full home solar system, it is a good first step for people who cannot install one. Some wonder if the system is really legal everywhere, since there are different rules about home wiring and what you can plug in. People also talk about how easy it is to move the system, which is good for renters. There are suggestions for improving the kit, like making it look nicer or adding better tracking to see the energy produced. Some are excited to try this for small projects or backup power, while a few worry about the quality of cheaper parts. Overall, most people agree it is a clever and simple way to start using solar power without too much trouble.

That’s all for today’s Hacker News Daily Podcast. Thank you for listening, and we hope these stories inspire you to try something new—whether it’s starting a personal blog or building your own solar kit. See you next time.
