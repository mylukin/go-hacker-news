## Gaussian Splatting – A$AP Rocky "Helicopter" music video

- 原文链接: [Gaussian Splatting – A$AP Rocky "Helicopter" music video](https://radiancefields.com/a-ap-rocky-releases-helicopter-music-video-featuring-gaussian-splatting)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46670024)

A$AP Rocky’s new music video for "Helicopter" uses a technology called Gaussian Splatting to capture and show 3D performances. Instead of using normal cameras, the team recorded almost every person in the video in 3D, making the video look wild and full of motion.

The team at Evercoast used 56 cameras to capture real stunts—like people hanging upside down, fighting, or swinging props. All the action you see was done by real people and then turned into 3D "splats," or blobs of color and light. This let the team change backgrounds, remove props, and play with how things looked, all while keeping the real movement of the actors.

The process created a huge amount of data—over 10 terabytes—which was then edited using special software like Houdini and OctaneRender. These tools let the artists relight the scenes, change shadows, and make the video look even more 3D. They also used Blender for planning and WildCapture’s tools to help keep movements smooth and realistic.

In past videos, A$AP Rocky has used similar tech like NeRFs, but this time, the use of dynamic Gaussian Splatting is bigger and more complex. The team could preview 3D scenes quickly, make changes fast, and didn’t have to wait for long processing times. This new way of filming gave them lots of creative freedom, letting them move the camera around in the 3D space after the recording.

Many people who watch the video think it’s made by AI, but actually, all the stunts are real—only the way they’re captured and shown is new. The technology does not fake reality, but instead keeps every detail of the real performance and lets the team play with it in post-production.

In the Hacker News comments, some people were amazed at how real performances could look so synthetic, with many noting the creative possibilities of volumetric capture. Others worried this kind of tech might make it harder to tell what’s real in the future. Some developers were curious about the technical side, asking about the hardware and software used and how much data storage and processing was needed.

A few users said the video style reminded them of early MTV or experimental art, praising the unique look. Others shared concerns about the cost and complexity, wondering how smaller teams could use similar technology. Some people thought this tech could change filmmaking, giving directors more control, while others warned that too much freedom might make videos too confusing or fake-looking.

There were also questions about how easy it would be to edit or fake performances with this system. Some users said this could help indie creators make cool effects without big budgets, while others wanted to see more open-source tools for Gaussian Splatting. Overall, the reactions were a mix of excitement, curiosity, and some skepticism about where this technology might lead next.

## Flux 2 Klein pure C inference

- 原文链接: [Flux 2 Klein pure C inference](https://github.com/antirez/flux2.c)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46670279)

Flux 2 Klein pure C inference is a project that lets you generate images from text prompts, using a big AI model, all written in the C programming language. The main idea is to run modern AI image generation without needing Python or heavy frameworks like PyTorch.

The program uses the FLUX.2-klein-4B model, which needs about 16GB of model data. You can build it for different systems: pure C (slow), with BLAS (faster), or with Metal for Apple Silicon (fastest). BLAS and Metal are used for speed, but you don’t have to use them. To get started, you build the project, download the model, and then run a command to make an image from a prompt. The tool can also change an image’s style, like turning a photo into an oil painting. It has almost no dependencies, just C and optional acceleration libraries. You don’t need Python, PyTorch, or CUDA. The model works with text-to-image and image-to-image, has a built-in text encoder, and is memory efficient (it frees up memory after encoding). The command-line interface lets you set options like image size, steps, seed, and more. There are clear examples for both using it as a command-line tool and as a C library for your own programs. The project was created to test if modern AI can help write real software, and the author says he wrote zero code himself; he used Claude AI (from Anthropic) to generate everything. The largest part of the model is the text encoder, which uses up to 8GB of RAM, but the code releases it when not needed. You can generate images up to 1024x1024 pixels. The API is simple, with functions to load models, generate images, and handle errors.

In the Hacker News comments, many people are impressed that the whole thing works in pure C, without Python. Some like that it’s easy to build and runs fast, especially on Apple Silicon. Others note that the model is very large (16GB) and this could be hard for some users. Some think it’s a great example of AI-assisted programming, saying it’s cool that the author guided Claude AI to create all the code. A few worry that AI-generated code could be hard to maintain or audit for bugs and security. Others discuss that C is not the usual language for AI work now, but this project shows it’s possible. Some people argue that not everyone needs Python, and that smaller, simpler tools are good for open source. There is also debate over whether pure C is the best for this, or if something like Rust or C++ would be safer. A few users try the tool and share their results, saying the images look good and the performance is impressive. There are questions about using the tool on other platforms, like Windows, and how easy it is to add your own models. Overall, the community finds the project interesting, both as a technical achievement and as a sign of what AI-assisted coding can do.

## A Social Filesystem

- 原文链接: [A Social Filesystem](https://overreacted.io/a-social-filesystem/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46665839)

This article talks about a new way to store and share data in social apps, called a “social filesystem.” It’s about making your data—like posts, likes, and follows—live in files you own, not locked inside each app.

Files are great because they belong to you. You can open them with many apps, move them, or even make new apps for your old files. In the past, each app had its own private data. But what if all your social activity, from every app, was stored in one folder you control? This folder, called your “everything folder,” would hold all your posts, likes, and more as files. Apps would just read and write these files, instead of keeping their own secret databases.

A new system called the AT protocol uses this idea. Apps like Bluesky now work by reading and writing these files, so you can switch apps without losing your stuff. Each thing you do online—a post, a follow, a like—is a “record,” which is just a small JSON file in your folder. Apps agree on the “shape” of each record using something called a lexicon, a type of schema.

To avoid confusion, each kind of record (like a Tumblr post or an Instagram follow) gets its own folder, named using a domain (like com.instagram.follow). Apps check the record’s shape before using it, just like checking if a file is really a photo or a PDF. Anyone can make new kinds of records or use old ones.

To link things across users, the system uses special IDs called DIDs, which always point to a person’s folder, even if they change their name or hosting. All records are linked using these DIDs and a special address that works even if you move your data. This makes the system strong and flexible.

When you like a post, your folder gets a “like” record pointing to the post’s file in someone else’s folder. The system keeps everything in sync by using events and caches, so apps can show counts and timelines without searching the whole network. You can even host your own folder, move it, or use special relays to help share data.

The article shows that this system is real and already used in some apps. You can explore your social data like a file manager. You can create posts, delete them, and see changes everywhere, since the data is the source of truth.

In the Hacker News comments, many people liked the idea of owning their own data and being able to switch apps freely. Some compared this to how email works—anyone can make an email app, and your messages move with you. Others worried about spam and abuse, since open systems can be messy. People also pointed out that it’s hard to get all apps to agree on data shapes, but the “collection” and “lexicon” approach helps with that.

A few commenters said the idea is not new, comparing it to protocols like ActivityPub, RSS, or even how Unix treats files. Some were happy to see working code and real apps using the model, not just theory. Others asked about privacy and security, since your data is now spread around in a way that’s hard to hide. Some thought the tech details (like DIDs and relays) might be too complex for normal users.

A few were skeptical, saying that big companies have little reason to give up control over user data. Some wondered if this model could scale to billions of users. Others liked the flexibility, saying it could help small indie apps compete with big platforms. Some hoped that, even if the idea doesn’t take over, it will push big apps to be more open.

In general, the comments showed excitement about more open, user-owned social platforms, but also many questions about trust, privacy, and real-world adoption.

## Breaking the Zimmermann Telegram (2018)

- 原文链接: [Breaking the Zimmermann Telegram (2018)](https://medium.com/lapsed-historian/breaking-the-zimmermann-telegram-b34ed1d73614)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46671174)

This article tells the story of how British codebreakers in World War I broke the Zimmermann Telegram, a secret message from Germany to Mexico. The telegram offered Mexico land in the US if it joined the war against America, and its discovery helped push the US into joining the war.

The British Admiralty created a secret codebreaking group called Room 40. Lieutenant Nigel De Grey, who spoke German and French, was called back to London to join this group. Room 40 got hold of secret German messages because the British had cut German cables and watched US cables used by Germany. The Germans thought the US cable was safe, but it actually passed through Britain, letting the British intercept messages.

De Grey and codebreaker Dilly Knox worked on a message sent by German Foreign Minister Arthur Zimmermann. Dilly, who was skilled at spotting patterns, noticed key words like “Mexico” and “Arizona.” Together, the two men decrypted the message and realized its importance: Germany wanted Mexico to attack the US if America entered the war. The telegram also suggested that Mexico invite Japan to join them.

Captain “Blinker” Hall, head of Room 40, had to decide how to give the telegram to the Americans without revealing the British were reading US diplomatic traffic. He found a way: the message was sent from Germany to the US, then re-encoded and sent to Mexico via Western Union. The British got a copy of the telegram from a clerk in Mexico, making it look like they got the message from Mexico, not from spying on US cables.

Convincing the US Ambassador the telegram was real took effort. De Grey had to bluff his way through a live decryption in front of an American official. Eventually, the US got the message, believed it, and published it. Soon after, the US declared war on Germany.

Hacker News commenters were impressed by the cleverness and courage of the codebreakers. Some noted how breaking codes changed history, making the story a great example of information warfare. Others discussed the ethical issues: was it right for Britain to spy on US traffic while the US was neutral? A few pointed out how similar codebreaking groups, like Bletchley Park, played big roles in World War II. Some wondered about the technical details of codebreaking at the time, and how easy or hard it was to intercept international messages. There was also discussion on how secrets and intelligence sometimes force people to lie or invent cover stories. A few users shared book recommendations and documentaries about codebreaking. Others reflected on how much luck played a part: if the message hadn’t landed on Dilly’s desk, things might have been different. Some saw this as a story about teamwork, showing how different skills—languages, puzzles, and quick thinking—made a difference. Finally, some people drew connections to today’s world, where codebreaking and digital spying are still important.

## Police Invested Millions in Shadowy Phone-Tracking Software Won't Say How Used

- 原文链接: [Police Invested Millions in Shadowy Phone-Tracking Software Won't Say How Used](https://www.texasobserver.org/texas-police-invest-tangles-sheriff-surveillance/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46672150)

Texas police spent millions on a powerful phone-tracking software called Tangles, but they will not say how it is used. The tool lets police track the movements of mobile phones in a large area, often without needing a warrant, by buying data from commercial sources.

The article explains that the Goliad County sheriff’s office first used Tangles after finding a store receipt at a crime scene. With $300,000 in grants, they bought the software to help with border security and human smuggling cases. Tangles uses “geofencing” to map where certain phones have been between two locations, like a liquor store and an immigration checkpoint. The software does not give police a person’s name, but it does show unique device IDs and travel patterns. Police say they use this as a first step to gather more evidence, not to make arrests on its own. Agencies in Texas, including the Department of Public Safety and even big cities like Dallas and Houston, have spent millions on Tangles and issued hundreds of user licenses. The company that makes Tangles, PenLink, says the software is used to fight serious crimes and only uses legal, commercial data. However, privacy experts and reporters found no clear examples where Tangles directly led to an arrest or prosecution. Even after years of use and large spending, police will not share specific cases or results.

Critics argue Tangles allows police to sidestep legal protections by buying location data instead of getting a judge’s order. The Supreme Court says police need a warrant for phone location data, but buying data from brokers creates a loophole. Privacy groups like the ACLU and EFF say this is a threat to rights and could be abused. Some people are worried that police use Tangles in secret because there are no clear rules for reporting or tracking its use. Others think the expensive software may not be very useful, since police and defense lawyers almost never see it mentioned in legal records. Some police, even those who own the software, admit they rarely use it out of fear of breaking privacy laws. A few commenters on Hacker News think police should be more open about how they use such tools, especially when public money is involved. Others are alarmed at the idea that anyone’s movements could be tracked without their knowledge. Some users point out that the tracking data is often old and not real-time, so its value in emergencies is limited. A few comments defended police, saying they need all the tools they can get to stop crime, but most agreed that there must be stronger rules to protect privacy.

A number of readers discussed the “revolving door” between tech companies and law enforcement, worrying this could lead to more surveillance and less transparency. Some compared Tangles to similar tools in other countries, noting that weak rules can lead to abuse. Many users wanted laws to require police to report when and how they use advanced tracking software. Others said that even if the data is “anonymous,” it is still easy to link device IDs to real people. Overall, most commenters were worried about the lack of public oversight and the risk of government overreach.

## Show HN: Lume 0.2 – Build and Run macOS VMs with unattended setup

- 原文链接: [Show HN: Lume 0.2 – Build and Run macOS VMs with unattended setup](https://cua.ai/docs/lume/guide/getting-started/introduction)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46670181)

Lume is a tool to create and run macOS and Linux virtual machines (VMs) on Apple Silicon Macs. It helps developers build AI agents, automate macOS tasks, and run software tests quickly without needing extra physical computers. Lume is open-source and uses Apple’s Virtualization Framework, so VMs run almost as fast as real machines.

With Lume, you can easily set up and control VMs from the command line or with an HTTP API. This makes it simple to automate workflows or build new tools. The tool supports features like running VMs headlessly (with no display), using sparse disk files that only use space when needed, and supporting Rosetta 2—so you can run x86 Linux binaries in ARM Linux VMs. Lume also lets you create "golden images" of macOS, so you can set up VMs automatically with no manual steps. It even automates the macOS setup process by simulating clicks and using OCR to get through the Setup Assistant.

Developers can use Lume to test their apps on different versions of macOS, do risky experiments in safe sandboxes, or run CI/CD tasks locally before pushing to the cloud. Lume can also connect with the Cua Computer SDK, so AI models can interact with VMs using screenshots and input simulation. The article says Anthropic uses a similar approach to let their Claude AI run code safely in VMs.

You need an Apple Silicon Mac to use Lume—Intel Macs are not supported. Lume is free and under the MIT license. To get started, you install it and run a few simple commands to create and start a VM.

Hacker News commenters are excited about Lume’s easy setup and automation features. Some think it’s great for testing across many macOS versions without lots of hardware. Others like the idea of using it for CI/CD or sandboxing untrusted software. A few users ask about security, wondering if running VMs this way is really safe. Some point out that Apple’s Virtualization Framework is still pretty new, so there might be missing features or bugs. There are also questions about performance, especially for graphics-heavy or GPU-based tasks. Several people wish there was support for Intel Macs, while others say Apple Silicon is the future anyway. Some indie hackers are interested in using Lume to build cloud macOS services. A few users are curious about licensing and if Apple will allow running macOS in the cloud. Others share tips on using Lume to automate boring setup steps or to create “clean” test environments fast. Overall, the community finds Lume promising, but they want to see how it grows and what real-world problems it solves.

## Sins of the Children (Adrian Tchaikovsky)

- 原文链接: [Sins of the Children (Adrian Tchaikovsky)](https://asteriskmag.com/issues/07/sins-of-the-children)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46669663)

This story is about a team of humans on an alien planet called Chelicer 14d. They are there to study and farm a local crop that is very useful for human technology.

At first, the team’s weather station is destroyed by a huge, dangerous alien bug, which kills one of their crew. The humans try to defend themselves, but realize that these giant “death-fleas” are a real threat. The planet’s main native life, called “Farmers,” are spider-like creatures that tend crops, but seem very passive and harmless. The humans start to exploit the planet, taking the crops and mostly ignoring the Farmers.

Soon, the death-fleas attack again, killing more Farmers and damaging the humans’ equipment, including their space elevator. The humans feel trapped and in danger, but the company in charge only cares about protecting the valuable crops and profits. The company decides to use drones to wipe out the death-fleas, so the farming can continue safely.

One of the scientists, FenJuan, discovers that all the alien species on the planet are strangely similar at the genetic level. They warn that the ecosystem is much more connected than it looks, with all creatures being life stages of one main species. The company ignores these warnings and continues killing the death-fleas and farming.

Over time, the team notices odd changes: plants turn into animals, animals turn into other forms, and some species disappear completely. It becomes clear that the planet’s ecosystem is just one species with a complex life cycle, each form turning into the next. By killing off the death-fleas, the humans break this cycle. Within a decade, all life on the planet dies out, and the humans are left with nothing but dust and regret.

In the comment section, many people praise the story’s twist and its message about unintended consequences. Some compare the exploitation of Chelicer to real-world human activity—like colonization, habitat destruction, and the Green Revolution. Others discuss the science, saying the story cleverly imagines a planet with only one evolving species instead of many. A few readers mention how the “corporate” attitude in the story—focusing only on profit—feels realistic and chilling.

Some commenters wish the humans had listened more to FenJuan and debated if the disaster could have been avoided. Others point out that the humans’ quick judgment about the “value” of the planet led to their downfall. A few people ask if there could be hope for the planet in the future, or if something new might evolve from the dust. Several readers enjoy the story’s writing style, saying it feels tense and immersive. A couple of comments joke about the “potato” crop and how dangerous it turned out to be.

Overall, readers see the story as a warning about ignoring nature’s complexity and the risks of focusing only on short-term profit. Some find it sad but thought-provoking, and others appreciate its science fiction twist on ecology.

## jQuery 4

- 原文链接: [jQuery 4](https://blog.jquery.com/2026/01/17/jquery-4-0-0/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46664755)

jQuery 4.0.0 is a new, major update for the jQuery JavaScript library, coming out 20 years after the first version. It brings many changes, removes old features, and drops support for some old browsers.

This version drops support for Internet Explorer 10 and below, as well as old versions of Edge, Firefox, iOS, and Android Browser. Support for IE11 will go away in the next big release. The codebase is now smaller because many old and unused functions were removed. jQuery is now using ES modules, which fits better with modern JavaScript tools and browsers. Some APIs (like `jQuery.trim` and `jQuery.isNumeric`) are gone, as browsers now have their own ways to do these things. If you used those, you should use native JavaScript instead. The focus and blur event order now matches the modern browser spec, so it could change how your code works if you relied on the old order. The slim build of jQuery is even smaller, with modules like Deferreds and Callbacks removed, since native Promises are available in most browsers now. jQuery 4.0 also adds support for Trusted Types and better handles Content Security Policy (CSP) settings. Internal methods that were never meant for public use have been removed from the main object. There is a new upgrade guide and migration plugin to help people update their code. The release is available on npm and the jQuery CDN, with a slim version for those who want a smaller file.

In the Hacker News comments, some people feel nostalgic, sharing memories of when jQuery was the main way to do JavaScript in the browser. Others point out that jQuery is still important for many old sites and projects, even if new apps use frameworks like React or Vue. Some are happy that old browser support is being dropped, saying it makes the code cleaner and easier to maintain. A few users worry about breaking changes and wonder how hard it will be to upgrade for large, old codebases. Many praise the move to ES modules, saying it brings jQuery closer to modern JavaScript. Some mention that removing deprecated APIs was overdue, and that using native browser functions is better now. There are jokes about how jQuery will “never die” because so many sites still depend on it. A few people are surprised that jQuery is still getting updates, showing how long-lasting the library has been. Some thank the jQuery team for all their work and for helping make web development easier over the years. Others debate if it’s better to stick with jQuery for old projects or fully rewrite them with new frameworks. There are comments about how the smaller file size is nice, but not a big deal with today’s fast internet. Some developers say they still reach for jQuery for small scripts or quick fixes. Finally, many agree that while jQuery is not as trendy now, it is still a trusted and useful tool for the web.

## Command-line Tools can be 235x Faster than your Hadoop Cluster (2014)

- 原文链接: [Command-line Tools can be 235x Faster than your Hadoop Cluster (2014)](https://adamdrake.com/command-line-tools-can-be-235x-faster-than-your-hadoop-cluster.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46666085)

This article compares using simple command-line tools to process chess game data versus running the same task on a Hadoop cluster. The author shows that, for a 1.75GB dataset of 2 million chess games, using shell commands on a laptop is much faster than using Hadoop on several cloud servers.

The author first explains that the main task is to count chess game results (win for white, win for black, or draw), which fits well with stream processing. On his laptop, he can process all the data in about 12 seconds, while the Hadoop cluster takes 26 minutes. He builds a pipeline using basic shell commands like `cat`, `grep`, `sort`, `uniq`, and `awk`. These tools can filter and count the results efficiently. By replacing some commands and parallelizing others, he reduces processing time even more. Using tools like `xargs` and `mawk`, he gets the total processing time down to just 12 seconds, over 200 times faster than Hadoop. He also points out that this approach uses very little memory, as it only needs to keep a few counters. The article argues that many "big data" problems are better solved with simple tools, unless the dataset is truly massive or must be distributed across many machines.

In the comments, many readers agree that shell tools are very powerful for small to medium-sized data tasks. Some say that people often use big data frameworks like Hadoop when they don’t really need to, leading to wasted time and resources. Others add that using command-line tools is not only fast but also easier to debug and maintain. A few point out that shell pipelines can break or become hard to read with more complex data, so bigger tools have their place for complicated jobs or huge datasets. Some readers share tips for making command-line pipelines even faster, suggesting tools like `ripgrep` or `fd`. There are also comments warning that not everyone knows how to write efficient shell scripts, so sometimes teams use Hadoop for familiarity and support. Others note that Hadoop and similar tools are still needed for tasks that require true distribution or fault-tolerance. Finally, several readers enjoy the clear example and say it's a good reminder to "start simple" before reaching for heavy tools.

## The Cathedral, the Megachurch, and the Bazaar

- 原文链接: [The Cathedral, the Megachurch, and the Bazaar](https://opensourcesecurity.io/2026/01-cathedral-megachurch-bazaar/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46608342)

This article talks about how open source projects have changed over time, using ideas from an old essay called "The Cathedral and the Bazaar." In the past, open source was controlled by small, closed groups (the "cathedral"), but then it became more open, like a busy market ("bazaar"). The writer says that today, many big open source projects—like Linux, Python, and Node.js—are more like "megachurches." These are large, organized groups with their own rules, leaders, and even lots of money from companies.

If you want to join these big projects, you must follow many rules about who owns the code and how you contribute. These groups often need you to give time or money. Some have millions of dollars and lots of people working for them. They check code carefully and care about legal details.

But most open source projects are still small. Many are run by just one person. These smaller projects do not have many rules and are not worried much about things like legal problems or money. They often do not get much attention, but they are everywhere. Some of these small projects may grow and join a big group, but most stay small and simple.

The writer says that the "bazaar" style is still alive and is actually the base for much of today’s technology. The problem is that these small projects are hard to fund or support. Some groups are trying to fix this by giving money to small projects with no rules, but it is not easy. There are big reports and studies about how to help, but real solutions may take a long time. The writer suggests that readers should look for small, unknown open source projects and try to learn or help out.

In the comments, some people agree that big open source projects have become like big companies or churches, with lots of rules and money. Others say that the small projects—the "bazaar"—are important but easy to forget because they are quiet and not famous. A few think the big projects are safer and better for users, because they have checks and teams, while small projects can be risky if only one person runs them. Some users talk about how hard it is for small project owners to get paid or get help, and they worry that this could make important open source tools disappear. Others point out that big companies use small projects but do not always support them. There are also people who say that both big and small open source are needed, and that everyone should try to help, even in small ways like reporting bugs or saying thanks. A few comments mention new ways to give money to small projects, but many agree it is still a tough problem. Some suggest that governments or big groups should help fund open source, but others are not sure this will work. Overall, most people in the comments agree that small open source projects are the hidden base of modern tech, and they deserve more support and attention.
