This article talks about browser fingerprinting, a way websites can track you even if you block cookies or use a VPN. It explains that browser fingerprinting collects many small details from your browser—like your browser version, operating system, language, time zone, installed fonts, extensions, and even how your computer draws pictures—to try and make a unique profile of you.

At first, the main worry for privacy was tracking cookies. Cookies can remember your login or shopping cart, but third-party cookies let advertisers follow you across the web. Laws and better browsers made tracking cookies less dangerous, but now fingerprinting is a bigger problem.

Fingerprinting doesn’t need cookies and is hard to avoid. Even using privacy tools can make you stand out more because few people use them. For example, disabling JavaScript or using rare browser settings can make you more unique. Some browsers or plugins try to fake fingerprint data, but these tricks often break websites or leave clues that you are trying to hide.

Canvas fingerprinting, where the site asks your browser to draw a hidden image and checks the result, is a strong example. The way your browser draws the image can be unique, based on your hardware and software. Even small things, like your window size, can help identify you.

There is a little good news. Real-world fingerprinting is not as perfect as some demo sites show, and browser developers are starting to fight back. Browsers like Brave, Mullvad, or Librewolf have built-in tools to resist fingerprinting, but nothing is perfect yet. The article suggests using common browsers with common settings, avoiding extra fonts or extensions, and using privacy tools like VPNs and deleting cookies.

However, these steps often make using the web harder. You might face more CAPTCHAs, broken websites, or be forced into boring setups. Stopping fingerprinting fully is almost impossible, and even laws are not clear about if it is legal. The author thinks new rules are needed to protect people, but advertisers will always look for new tricks.

In the Hacker News comments, many people agree that fingerprinting is a big privacy problem and very hard to stop. Some say that using very popular browsers and not changing settings can help, but it feels unfair to force everyone to use the same boring setup. Others mention that fingerprinting is often used for good reasons too, like stopping fraud or abuse, so banning it might hurt some websites.

A few users point out that making fingerprinting illegal will only push trackers to use even sneakier methods. Some think that browsers and operating systems should do more to hide users, while others believe that privacy is almost impossible on today’s web—unless you accept lots of inconvenience.

There’s debate over whether using privacy browsers like Tor or Brave really helps, since these can also make you stand out if only a few people use them. Some people share tips, like using “containers” or separate browser profiles for different tasks, but admit these are not simple for most users.

A handful of commenters are hopeful, saying that as more people care about privacy, browser makers will make fingerprinting less effective. Others are more cynical, warning that advertisers always find ways around technical or legal blocks.

Overall, the comments agree that browser fingerprinting is a tough problem, with no easy fix, and a trade-off between privacy and ease of use. Many end up accepting some tracking just to have a working internet.

## WorldGen – Text to Immersive 3D Worlds

- 原文链接: [WorldGen – Text to Immersive 3D Worlds](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/blog/worldgen-3d-world-generation-reality-labs-generative-ai-research/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46018380)

Meta’s new research project, WorldGen, can turn a simple text prompt into a full 3D world you can walk around in. The idea is that you type something like “cartoon medieval village” or “sci-fi base station on Mars,” and the system quickly builds a detailed, interactive 3D scene that matches your request.

WorldGen uses several AI and graphics techniques together. First, it plans out the world’s layout and creates rough shapes for buildings and objects. Then it builds a map for characters to walk on, makes a reference image, and turns this into a 3D model. The system then breaks the world into parts, cleans up the data, and adds more detail and textures. This way, the world looks good from all angles, not just from one spot. WorldGen can build large scenes (like 50x50 meters) that keep the same style and quality everywhere. The 3D worlds it makes work with popular game engines like Unity and Unreal without extra steps.

Right now, WorldGen is still in the research stage, so developers can’t use it yet. Meta says they want to make it faster and able to build even bigger worlds in the future. The goal is to make 3D world creation easier and cheaper, so more people can create virtual spaces without needing special skills.

On Hacker News, people were both excited and cautious. Some users thought WorldGen could save a lot of time for game makers and hobbyists, making 3D creation as easy as writing a sentence. Others said that while the demo is cool, real games and apps need more than just nice-looking worlds—they need gameplay, characters, and logic, which are still hard to make with AI. Some worried about how unique or creative these AI worlds can be, since they might start to look the same or lack personal touch. A few pointed out that tools like this could lead to lots of low-quality or spammy content if everyone can make 3D worlds so easily. There was also talk about how much compute power this system needs and if it’s practical for regular users. Some developers shared hopes that, with time, these tools could help small teams or solo creators do things only big studios could do before. Others said they’d prefer open-source or offline options, not just ones from big companies like Meta. Overall, people saw big promise but also many challenges ahead before this becomes a normal tool in game or app development.

## Show HN: Forty.News – Daily news, but on a 40-year delay

- 原文链接: [Show HN: Forty.News – Daily news, but on a 40-year delay](https://forty.news)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46017175)

This article is about Forty.News, a site that shares news stories with a 40-year delay, letting readers see how big events were reported in the past. The idea is to give readers perspective, showing that what once felt urgent now looks different over time.

The main argument is that news often feels urgent and dramatic in the moment, but as years pass, our view changes. The site gives examples from November 1985, such as the Air-India crash caused by an explosion, tense FBI standoffs with white supremacist groups, protests and violence in South Africa under apartheid, and the first international artificial heart patient’s death. There are also stories about Reagan and Gorbachev’s summit, farm bailouts, animal antibiotics, and debates about U.S. policy on South Africa. By showing these stories now, the site helps readers notice which events had long-term impact and which faded away. The site wants people to make a habit of taking a step back and looking at news with more context and less panic.

In the comment section, some people say this delayed-news idea is clever. They like seeing which stories still matter and which have been forgotten. A few find it humbling to realize that most “breaking news” isn’t important in the long run. Others say it helps them calm down about today’s headlines, knowing that time changes what feels urgent. Some users compare Forty.News to old newspapers and microfilm in libraries, but like that it’s more convenient and curated. A few developers discuss how the site could be improved with better search or ways to follow specific topics. One person wonders if it could help teach media literacy and history in schools. But a few worry that seeing old tragedies might make people less sensitive to real problems today. Others point out that sometimes, even stories that looked small at first end up shaping the future. Overall, readers appreciate the chance to reflect and see how the meaning of news can change over decades.

## The Mozilla Cycle, Part III: Mozilla Dies in Ignominy

- 原文链接: [The Mozilla Cycle, Part III: Mozilla Dies in Ignominy](https://taggart-tech.com/mozilla-cycle-pt3/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46017910)

This article talks about Mozilla’s new plan to focus on artificial intelligence (AI), especially in Firefox, and how their users are reacting. The author says Mozilla is moving away from its old mission of supporting an open web, and instead is trying to survive by adding AI features—even though many users do not want this.

The article explains that Mozilla’s new “AI Window” will change how people use Firefox. Instead of typing in a web address or search, people will talk to an AI that helps them use the web. Mozilla believes generative AI (like chatbots) is the future, and says the web is now controlled by big tech companies using closed AI models. So, Mozilla wants to create open-source AI tools and products to compete.

But the author does not agree with Mozilla’s ideas. They say most AI features in browsers are not useful, and sometimes make things worse. For example, Microsoft and Google are pushing AI, but their tools are not better than old search or keyboard use. The article points out that people learn less from AI results, and that AI browsers are not safe from old or new security problems.

Mozilla’s new goals include making flagship AI products in all their companies by 2028, growing their user community, and making more money from sources other than search deals. The author says these goals are unrealistic, because most Firefox users dislike the new AI features and will probably leave. Mozilla’s money mostly comes from search deals with companies like Google, but this income is dropping, so Mozilla wants to find new ways to make money.

The author looks at Mozilla’s three reasons for their AI plan: that AI will change how people use computers, that open-source AI is needed, and that public-interest AI should be supported by governments. The article argues that these ideas do not match reality. The author says AI is not trustworthy or user-centered, and that truly open-source AI is not possible because big AI models are trained on data that may break copyright rules.

In the end, the author thinks Mozilla’s new direction is not what their users want. They believe Mozilla is choosing short-term money over their mission, and that it would be better to let Mozilla die than to see it become something so different.

People in the Hacker News comments have many strong opinions. Some agree with the article and feel Mozilla is ignoring its loyal users. They say adding AI by default is the wrong move, and it makes them want to switch to other browsers. A few defend Mozilla, saying the company must change to survive, since money from search deals is shrinking and competition is tough.

Other commenters point out that Mozilla has lost its way several times before, not just now. Some remember when Firefox was the clear choice for privacy and open web, and feel sad about these changes. There are suggestions that the web itself is changing, not just Mozilla, and that all browsers are becoming more controlled by big companies.

A few people say that open-source AI is still important, even if it is hard, and they hope Mozilla can help build better tools for everyone. Some discuss the technical problems with AI in browsers, and worry about privacy and safety. Others think Mozilla’s business plan is risky, and may fail if the AI “bubble” bursts.

Some commenters say they will keep using Firefox as long as possible, but want clear ways to turn off unwanted features. There is also talk about forking Firefox, or making new browsers, if the changes become too much. Finally, several people just feel disappointed, saying it’s a shame to watch Mozilla drift so far from what made it special.

## $1900 Bug Bounty to Fix the Lenovo Legion Pro 7 16IAX10H's Speakers on Linux

- 原文链接: [$1900 Bug Bounty to Fix the Lenovo Legion Pro 7 16IAX10H's Speakers on Linux](https://github.com/nadimkobeissi/16iax10h-linux-sound-saga)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45940980)

This article explains how to fix broken speakers on the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 laptop when running Linux. The sound did not work well on Linux before, so the community set up a $1900 bug bounty to find a solution.

The guide walks through each step to get the speakers working. First, you need to install special firmware for the speaker chip. Next, you must download the correct Linux kernel source code (version 6.17.8) and apply a custom patch that changes 10 files. The guide tells you which settings to enable in the kernel configuration. After that, you compile and install the new kernel on your machine.

If you use NVidia graphics, you have to install special drivers for the updated kernel. Then, you create a new initramfs file and update your bootloader so the system uses the new kernel. The guide gives clear instructions for Arch Linux and Fedora users. After rebooting, you confirm the new kernel is running.

There is also an important step to install a patched configuration file for ALSA (the Linux audio system). You check your sound card ID and run some commands to set the speaker volume. These commands are needed to make the speakers work but do not set the maximum volume. Once you finish all steps, your audio should work perfectly, even after restarting.

The article gives credit to the main developers. Most of the code was written by Lyapsus, who improved the Linux kernel drivers and wrote new code for the speaker chip. Nadim Kobeissi, the guide's author, did the first investigation, helped with testing, and fixed the volume control problem. Another person, Gergo K., helped extract the needed firmware from Windows drivers.

In the comment section, many users say they are impressed by the effort and teamwork. Some are happy to see a real fix for a common Linux hardware problem. Others praise the clear, step-by-step guide and the fact that the fix will help many people. A few users ask why such basic hardware support is missing from Linux in 2024. Some think laptop makers should help Linux users more, or at least provide needed files.

A few comments worry about how hard these steps are for non-experts. Some say it is risky to run custom kernels or firmware. Other users point out that open-source drivers for new laptops take a long time, and community bounties help speed things up. Some hope this fix will be added to the main Linux kernel soon, so it is easier for everyone. Overall, people are thankful for the fix, but wish hardware support on Linux was less trouble.

## China reaches energy milestone by "breeding" uranium from thorium

- 原文链接: [China reaches energy milestone by "breeding" uranium from thorium](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3331312/china-reaches-energy-independence-milestone-breeding-uranium-thorium)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46016639)

China has made a big step in energy by creating uranium from thorium. This process is called "breeding" because it makes new fuel for nuclear power.

The article explains that China used a special reactor to turn thorium, which is common, into uranium-233. This uranium can be used as fuel for nuclear power plants. Thorium is easier to find than the usual uranium, so this could help make more energy for the world. The process uses a molten salt reactor, which is different from typical reactors. Molten salt reactors are safer because they work at lower pressure and can shut down by themselves if something goes wrong. They also make less nuclear waste. China’s experiment was small, but it worked, and that is important. The country wants to build bigger reactors in the future. If they succeed, this could mean cleaner and safer nuclear energy. The article also says that other countries, like the United States and India, have studied thorium reactors before, but China is the first to show this kind of progress.

In the Hacker News comments, some people are very excited about this news. They say it could solve many energy problems and help the world move away from fossil fuels. Others are more cautious. They point out that building big thorium reactors is still very hard and expensive. Some say that while the science is good, it might take many years before this technology is ready for everyone. A few users worry about safety and the risk of making nuclear weapons material. Others argue that molten salt reactors are much safer than old types. Some people think it is good that China is leading, while others wish more countries would invest in this technology. Overall, the comments show both hope and concern about using thorium for energy in the future.

## TIL: `satisfies` is my favorite TypeScript keyword

- 原文链接: [TIL: `satisfies` is my favorite TypeScript keyword](https://sjer.red/blog/2024-12-21/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45968310)

The article talks about the `satisfies` keyword in TypeScript and why the author likes it. TypeScript is a language that helps catch errors before you run your code, but its type system can be hard to learn.

When you create an object in TypeScript, the types are not always as precise as you might expect. For example, if you make an object with a `name` set to `"Jerred"`, TypeScript often thinks the type is `string` instead of just `"Jerred"`. This is because objects can usually be changed, so TypeScript keeps the type flexible.

If you want a function to only accept `"Jerred"` as a value, you must help TypeScript know that. The usual way is to give the variable a more exact type. But this can be messy, especially if your objects are big or you want TypeScript to infer as much as possible.

The `satisfies` keyword is a new way to do this. It checks that your value matches a type, but lets TypeScript keep more detailed information about the value. It is kind of like a safer version of casting. For example, when you use `satisfies`, TypeScript checks your object but also keeps the exact values and types inside. This helps when you want your code to be as safe and clear as possible.

The author shows that `satisfies` is very useful when you have complex types or want TypeScript to be very strict. It helps you avoid writing extra code just to make the type system happy.

In the comments, some people said they did not know about `satisfies` and were happy to learn. A few said they often run into problems with TypeScript’s type inference and now see how `satisfies` can help. Others pointed out that this keyword was added in TypeScript 4.9, so you need a newer version to use it.

Some developers said they still prefer to write explicit types, especially in big codebases, because it is more clear for new team members. Others mentioned that `satisfies` is great for libraries, configs, or when you want to be strict about object shapes. There was also discussion about how `satisfies` helps prevent silly mistakes, like missing fields in objects, and how it can make code easier to refactor. A few commenters said they hope more people will use and teach this feature because it helps make TypeScript code safer and easier to understand.

## Markdown Is Holding You Back

- 原文链接: [Markdown Is Holding You Back](https://newsletter.bphogan.com/archive/issue-45-markdown-is-holding-you-back/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46017782)

The article talks about why Markdown, even though it is popular, may not be the best tool for technical writing. The author explains that Markdown is easy and quick for simple documents but has big limits when you need more structure, especially for machines or big teams.

Markdown is simple and readable, which is why many people use it for documentation. But Markdown does not give much information about the meaning of the content. For example, a bullet point could be a list item, a step, or a note, but Markdown does not say which one it is. This makes it hard for search engines, AI, or other tools to understand your documents fully. Also, there are many versions of Markdown, and what works in one tool might not work in another, making things confusing.

Some people try to solve this by adding custom parts to Markdown, like MDX, which mixes React components with Markdown. But this only works in special systems and breaks when you move your content somewhere else. The author says this is like creating your own language, which is fragile and hard to share.

The author suggests looking at other formats that are better for structure, such as reStructuredText, AsciiDoc, DocBook, and DITA. These formats use special tags or commands to show the meaning of each part of the document. For example, you can mark something as a step, a note, or a command, and this is clear for both people and machines. With these formats, it is easier to reuse content, publish in different ways (like HTML or PDF), and help machines answer questions about your docs.

The article gives short examples for each format, showing how they help with structure. It also says that moving to XML-based formats like DocBook or DITA can be hard to start, but they are better for big projects or teams.

In the end, the author says Markdown is okay for small, quick docs. But for bigger or more complex docs, it is better to use something with more structure. If you start with a rich format, you can always make a simple version later, but it is hard to add structure if you start with Markdown.

In the comments, some people agree with the author and say they have hit Markdown’s limits, especially when trying to share or reuse docs across different systems. Others say they like Markdown because it is simple, easy, and works for most things they do. A few point out that tools like GitHub and static site generators are built around Markdown, so switching is hard unless everyone changes at once. Some think that adding structure to Markdown, with plugins or extensions, is enough for their needs and do not like the idea of using XML because it is complicated. Others remember times when documentation was even messier and think Markdown is a big improvement over what came before. A few people suggest that using better tools for big docs makes sense but say most projects do not need that much structure. One commenter warns that having too much structure can slow you down or make writing docs less fun. Some share tips for moving from Markdown to other formats, while others ask for easy ways to add more structure to their current docs. Overall, the comments show that people want a balance between simple writing and enough structure to help both humans and machines.

## The Go-Between

- 原文链接: [The Go-Between](https://theamericanscholar.org/the-go-between/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46017934)

This article tells the story of Helen Paull Kirkpatrick, an American journalist during World War II, and her brother Lyman, who worked in U.S. intelligence. Helen became the first female foreign correspondent for the Chicago Daily News in 1939, just as war broke out in Europe. She had strong connections in London’s upper class and started her career by cofounding a respected newsletter and writing books about British politics.

Helen’s reporting was fast and reliable. She often broke important news, sometimes using secret sources. Sometimes her stories were published under other names to protect her contacts. She reported on big events, like the German invasion of Belgium, and traveled widely in Europe, following the war closely. Helen was respected, but also sometimes doubted, partly because women reporters were rare and not always trusted during the war.

Helen’s brother Lyman also played a big role in the war, joining U.S. intelligence and later the CIA. The two siblings helped each other with jobs and contacts, but their relationship was kept quiet in public records. Some people wondered if Helen’s access to secret information was only due to her reporting skills, or if she got help from her brother’s intelligence work. Helen sometimes did things that crossed the line between journalism and espionage, like carrying secret messages for diplomats and sharing information with Allied officials.

Helen received the U.S. Medal of Freedom, the only woman correspondent to do so during the war, and also won top French awards. Lyman became a high-ranking official in the CIA after the war, and both siblings had a reputation for keeping secrets. Helen later worked for the State Department and in education, but never bragged about her achievements.

In the comments, readers are impressed by Helen’s bravery and reporting skills, and some point out how tough it was for women journalists at that time. Others discuss the blurry line between journalism and intelligence, especially during war. Some think Helen’s good reporting and social skills explain her access, while others wonder if her connections gave her an unfair advantage. A few say her story shows how journalism and spying can mix in times of conflict, though not everyone agrees this is right. Many admire her courage, while some raise ethical questions about her role. Some commenters also appreciate the detailed family history and the glimpse into upper-class networks in Britain and America. Others debate whether Helen was really a spy or just a very good journalist. Overall, people find her story inspiring, but complicated.
