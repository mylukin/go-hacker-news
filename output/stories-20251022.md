## Ovi: Twin backbone cross-modal fusion for audio-video generation

- 原文链接: [Ovi: Twin backbone cross-modal fusion for audio-video generation](https://github.com/character-ai/Ovi)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45674166)

Ovi is a new AI model that can create videos with both video and audio from text or images. The model is open source and made by Character AI and Yale University.

Ovi works a bit like other text-to-video tools, but it can make both high-quality audio and video at the same time. You can give it just text, or text plus an image, and it will make a 5-second video with matching sound. The model was trained at 720x720 resolution, but it can make even higher-resolution videos, like 1280x704, with good results. Ovi can also make videos in different shapes, such as vertical or square. You can try Ovi online at sites like wavespeed.ai or HuggingFace, and there’s a work-in-progress plugin for ComfyUI.

The project gives example prompts to help you get started, and you can control the speech and audio in your videos with special tags. Ovi supports both text-to-audio-video and image-to-audio-video creation. The instructions explain how to install everything, including the Python code and all the needed libraries. Ovi needs a strong GPU (at least 32GB VRAM), but there are options to run it on 24GB GPUs with some loss in quality.

You can control how Ovi works by editing a config file—this lets you set things like video size, quality, and how much the video and audio should follow the input prompt. There are tips for running Ovi on one or more GPUs and for using a Gradio web interface. The team also thanks other open-source projects they used, like Wan2.2 for video and MMAudio for audio.

Now, let’s look at the top Hacker News comments. Some users are impressed with Ovi’s high-quality results, especially how well the audio and video match. Others compare Ovi to models like Sora or Veo, saying it’s exciting to see open-source projects catch up with big tech companies. Several people point out that the hardware requirements are very high—32GB or even 80GB of GPU VRAM is out of reach for most users. Some wish for a smaller or “distilled” model that would run on regular consumer hardware.

A few commenters worry about possible copyright or misuse if people start generating fake videos with real voices. Others ask about how well Ovi handles lip-sync or background sounds, and some share their own test results—some had good luck, while others found glitches or strange audio. People are also interested in using Ovi for creative projects, like making short films or game cutscenes.

There’s debate about the future of open-source AI for video and audio. Some think tools like Ovi will quickly become easier and cheaper to use, while others think the need for big hardware will slow down open-source progress. A few users hope for cloud-based demos, so people can try Ovi without a powerful computer. Overall, there’s a lot of excitement, but also some caution about the challenges ahead.

## Willow quantum chip demonstrates verifiable quantum advantage on hardware

- 原文链接: [Willow quantum chip demonstrates verifiable quantum advantage on hardware](https://blog.google/technology/research/quantum-echoes-willow-verifiable-quantum-advantage/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45670443)

Google’s new article talks about their Willow quantum chip running a special algorithm called Quantum Echoes, which shows a real, verifiable quantum advantage over classical supercomputers. The Quantum Echoes algorithm lets the quantum chip solve problems, like finding the structure of molecules, much faster than any classical computer—up to 13,000 times faster in their tests.

This is the first time a quantum computer ran an algorithm that could be checked and repeated, making sure the result is correct and not just random. The way the Quantum Echoes algorithm works is like sending a signal into the chip, disturbing one part, and then reversing the process to listen for an “echo.” This echo gets stronger because of quantum effects, making small details easier to measure. Google ran this on their Willow chip, which has 105 qubits and very low error rates, meaning it can do complex things accurately.

They also used this approach to study molecules with 15 and 28 atoms. The results matched traditional methods but also gave new information not possible before. This could help scientists in fields like drug discovery and materials science, where knowing the shape of molecules is important. The article says that these advances bring us closer to quantum computers being useful for real-world science, not just theory. Google’s team is now focusing on making even bigger, more reliable quantum computers.

From the Hacker News comments, many people are excited but cautious. Some are impressed by the speedup and the fact that results can now be verified, which was a problem in earlier quantum claims. Others point out that while this is a big technical step, the problems being solved are still quite specialized, not general-purpose yet. A few say that “quantum advantage” is sometimes used in marketing, and want to see more independent checks and real-world use cases. Some developers ask if this means quantum computers will soon help with things like cryptography or machine learning, but the answer seems to be “not yet.” There’s also a discussion about the hardware: people agree that lowering error rates is a huge deal, and this might finally make quantum computers reliable for longer tasks. Finally, some are skeptical—reminding everyone that “real-world” is a high bar, and it may still take years before most people see quantum benefits in their work.

## JMAP for Calendars, Contacts and Files Now in Stalwart

- 原文链接: [JMAP for Calendars, Contacts and Files Now in Stalwart](https://stalw.art/blog/jmap-collaboration/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45672336)

Stalwart just announced that it now supports JMAP for calendars, contacts, files, and sharing, making it the first server to fully support all JMAP collaboration protocols. This is a big step for open-source groupware and modern communication tools.

The article explains that JMAP is a new set of protocols made to replace old systems like CalDAV, CardDAV, and WebDAV, which are used for syncing emails, calendars, and contacts. These older systems use XML and have become messy and hard to work with. They spread information in many places, making it difficult for different apps to work together. Formats like iCalendar and vCard, used for events and contacts, also have lots of old, unused parts that make them hard to handle.

JMAP is different because it uses JSON over HTTPS, making everything simpler, faster, and easier for both developers and users. With JMAP, mail, calendar, contacts, files, and sharing all work with the same simple rules. New formats called JSCalendar and JSContact also use JSON, so they are easier to read and less likely to cause problems.

The article says this change should make it much easier for new apps and services to work together. Developers can focus on building good features instead of fighting with complicated, old protocols. Stalwart is the first to support all these JMAP protocols, but other apps like Mailtemi, Parula, and OpenCloud are already working to add support too. The JMAP ecosystem is expected to grow quickly.

Stalwart thanks NLNet and the NGI Zero grant program for supporting this work. The team says Stalwart is now feature complete and will keep working on making things faster and more stable, aiming for a version 1.0.0 soon.

In the comments, many users are happy to see a modern, JSON-based replacement for old XML protocols. Some say JMAP will make writing calendar and contact apps much easier and note that XML-based systems were hard to use and often buggy. A few people share worries about how fast apps will adopt JMAP, since many clients still use the old standards. Some users ask about how well JMAP works with popular apps like Thunderbird or Apple Calendar, and others are curious about syncing with mobile devices.

Some developers are excited to try building new tools with JMAP, while others ask about security and privacy features. A few people wonder if this will help break up the dominance of big companies in email and collaboration tools. Overall, most comments are hopeful and see this as a big improvement for open communication and developer experience.

## Mass Assignment Vulnerability Exposes Max Verstappen Passport and F1 Drivers PII

- 原文链接: [Mass Assignment Vulnerability Exposes Max Verstappen Passport and F1 Drivers PII](https://ian.sh/fia)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45673130)

This article is about a big security problem found on a Formula 1 website managed by the FIA, where hackers could access private data of famous drivers like Max Verstappen. The authors found a bug in the FIA's driver categorization portal that let them become admin users and see sensitive information.

They explain that F1 drivers need a special license from FIA, and this portal helps manage driver categories (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum). To use the portal, you register and upload personal documents. While testing, the authors noticed the website used a simple HTTP PUT request to update user profiles. The response from this request showed extra fields, including a "roles" parameter. By editing this parameter and sending a new request, they changed their user role to "admin." After refreshing their session, they got full admin access to the site.

As admins, they could see all kinds of private information: emails, phone numbers, passport scans, resumes, and even password hashes for the drivers. This included top F1 drivers like Max Verstappen. They also saw internal FIA communications and decision notes. The authors say they stopped testing before downloading or misusing any sensitive data and deleted what they found.

The authors reported the problem to FIA, who quickly took the site offline and later fixed the bug. The article is part of a series showing several security problems in F1-related systems.

In the Hacker News comments, many users were shocked that such a simple bug could exist in a high-profile site. Some said mass assignment bugs are common when developers use frameworks without understanding security settings. Others pointed out that handling roles or admin rights from user input is a big mistake. A few commenters wondered if the FIA ever did security audits, given how much sensitive data they collect. Some praised the authors for responsible disclosure and not abusing the access. Others used the story to remind everyone that even big organizations can have basic security flaws. People discussed how easy it is to miss these issues if you don’t test what happens when users send more data than expected. Some said this shows why regular security reviews are important, especially for sites with personal data. One user joked that F1 should focus less on sponsorships and more on fixing their IT. There was also a debate about whether open-source software or commercial frameworks are safer for this kind of site. Finally, several readers thanked the researchers for sharing the technical details, so others can learn and avoid the same mistake.

## Why SSA Compilers?

- 原文链接: [Why SSA Compilers?](https://mcyoung.xyz/2025/10/21/ssa-1/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45674568)

This article explains why modern compilers use something called SSA, or Static Single Assignment form. SSA is a way to represent programs inside a compiler to make them easier to analyze and optimize.

The main idea of SSA is that every variable gets assigned only once. This turns the program into a kind of graph, like a circuit, where it's easy to see how values flow and depend on each other. In normal code, variables can change many times, which makes it hard for the compiler to know what is happening. By rewriting the code so that each variable is only set once, the compiler can use graph theory to find and remove useless code, spot independent operations, and make better choices about how to run the program.

The article shows how a simple C program can be rewritten in SSA form, replacing every update to a variable with a new version of that variable. It also describes how loops and branches are handled using "basic blocks" and special nodes (like "phi" nodes) that select which value to use when control flow merges. The author shows how this looks in a made-up SSA language, similar to what compilers like LLVM use.

The article goes into detail about how compilers can optimize memory usage by tracking how values are stored and loaded. It explains how the compiler can sometimes replace memory loads with direct variable use, but only if it can be sure which value is being used. This involves analyzing the program's control flow graph (CFG) and understanding which parts of the program "dominate" others. The author also describes clean-up steps, like deleting unused code and merging blocks, to keep the program simple after optimizations.

In the Hacker News comments, some people say this article is a great explanation and helps make SSA feel less mysterious. Others point out that while SSA is powerful, it can be tricky to implement, especially when dealing with things like pointers, aliasing, or low-level languages like C. Some users discuss how functional languages use different approaches, and why SSA is best suited for imperative languages with variables that change.

There are comments about how SSA makes certain optimizations much easier, like constant folding and dead code elimination, but also about the challenges of turning SSA back into real machine code, especially if there are not enough registers. Some readers are curious about how different compilers handle SSA, mentioning tools like LLVM, GCC, and Go, and how each has its own flavor of SSA.

A few commenters warn that beginners might still find SSA hard to follow, especially with all the graph theory terms. Others share resources and papers for learning more, or suggest simpler examples. Overall, people agree that SSA is a core idea in compiler design today, and this article does a good job of explaining both why it is used and how it works in practice.

## Scripts I wrote that I use all the time

- 原文链接: [Scripts I wrote that I use all the time](https://evanhahn.com/scripts-i-wrote-that-i-use-all-the-time/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45670052)

This article is about a developer who shares shell scripts they wrote and use often to make daily computer tasks easier. The scripts help with things like copying text, managing files, running commands, and working with the web.

Some scripts make working with the clipboard simpler, like ‘copy’ to copy output and ‘pasta’ to paste it somewhere else. There’s a script to quickly copy your current directory path and another to watch clipboard changes. For files, ‘mkcd’ makes a new folder and goes inside it, and ‘tempe’ puts you in a temporary folder for quick experiments. ‘Trash’ lets you move files to the trash instead of deleting them forever, which is safer than ‘rm’. There are scripts for quickly creating shell scripts, serving files over HTTP, and downloading media from YouTube or SoundCloud. Other scripts help with text: getting a specific line, making quick notes, changing quote styles, and formatting JSON. There are helpers for converting text to upper or lower case, using the NATO alphabet, or looking up Unicode characters. The author also has REPL launcher scripts for Python, Node, and other languages.

For dates and time, there’s a script to print today’s date, one to start a timer with a sound and notification, and one to show the calendar. Audio and video scripts help play music, show pictures, extract text from images, or even watch videos in the terminal. Process helpers make it easier to run commands on lists of files, kill stubborn processes, or wait for something to finish. There are also scripts to look up emoji, HTTP statuses, and the alphabet. System helpers let you switch between dark and light themes, put your system to sleep, or clean up annoying macOS files. Finally, there are scripts for notifications, printing UUIDs, and viewing the source of commands.

In the comments, many people say they have similar scripts and that personal tools like this are very useful. Some share their own favorites, like scripts for searching files, renaming, or changing settings fast. A few people say they prefer to use existing tools (like ‘ag’, ‘jq’, or ‘fd’) instead of writing their own scripts. Others note that making scripts is a good way to learn about your system and save time in the long run. Some warn that too many custom scripts can make switching computers harder, or that scripts can break when OS updates change commands. There’s also a discussion about sharing scripts with co-workers and how to keep them portable. A few like that the author’s scripts work on both macOS and Linux. Some people say they now want to share their own script collections, and others thank the author for giving good ideas to improve their workflows.

## Element: setHTML() method

- 原文链接: [Element: setHTML() method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/setHTML)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45666497)

The article explains the new `setHTML()` method for web elements, which is an experimental browser feature meant to make adding HTML to the page safer. Unlike `innerHTML`, `setHTML()` automatically removes dangerous parts of the HTML string, like `<script>` tags and unsafe attributes, helping to protect against XSS attacks. You use it like this: `element.setHTML(htmlString, options)`, where you can pass a sanitizer to control what tags or attributes are allowed. If you do not set options, it uses the default sanitizer, which is strict and safe for most cases.

If you try to allow risky things like `<script>` tags or event attributes (like `onclick`), `setHTML()` still removes them, even if your sanitizer says it's okay. This makes it much safer than `innerHTML`, which just puts anything you give it into the page. The method returns nothing and will throw an error if you use a bad sanitizer config. There are code examples showing how to use the default and custom sanitizers, and a live demo to see how unsafe content is cleaned up.

The method is not in all browsers yet, so you must check compatibility before using it in real-world projects. It is not supported by the Trusted Types API, so it is only for cleaning up HTML, not for deep security needs. The article suggests using `setHTML()` for any untrusted HTML, and not using the unsafe version unless you really know what you are doing.

In the comment section, many people are happy to see a safer option than `innerHTML`, as XSS is a big problem for websites. Some users warn that because support across browsers is still limited, you cannot rely on `setHTML()` alone yet. Others mention that libraries like DOMPurify have done a similar job for years, and wonder if this new API will replace such libraries in the future. A few commenters question if developers will use the sanitizer options correctly, or if they will just use the defaults and think their sites are always safe. One person points out that even if the sanitizer is strict, you should still be careful with any user input. Another asks if performance will be a problem with big HTML strings, but others say the built-in method should be fast. Some are excited for the future when this becomes standard, as it could make safer websites much easier to build. Others say it is a good step, but browser makers need to work together to make it available everywhere.

## André Gorz, the Theorist Who Predicted the Revolt Against Meaningless Work (2023)

- 原文链接: [André Gorz, the Theorist Who Predicted the Revolt Against Meaningless Work (2023)](https://znetwork.org/znetarticle/andre-gorz-was-the-theorist-who-predicted-the-revolt-against-meaningless-work/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45606518)

This article talks about the ideas of André Gorz, a thinker who wrote about why many people are unhappy with their jobs and why work feels meaningless for so many today. Gorz saw long ago that work was changing with new technology and the rise of what we now call “neoliberalism,” and he thought people would start to push back against boring or pointless jobs.

Gorz’s book, “Farewell to the Working Class,” argued that work is no longer the center of political life, especially as jobs become less stable and more people work in services or gig jobs. During the pandemic, many people had time to think about their lives and work, leading to the “Great Resignation,” where millions left their jobs not just for better pay, but to find more meaning. Gorz said that in the past, skilled workers had power and pride in their work, but automation and new management styles have taken that away. Factories are now split up and managed from far away, so workers feel no control or connection to what they do.

He called this new kind of worker the “neo-proletariat,” often overqualified for their jobs and unable to find meaning in their work. Many get stuck in stressful jobs, are managed by algorithms, or are forced into fake “self-employment” with few rights. Gorz thought real freedom would come from breaking away from work, not just trying to change it from within. He believed that creativity and knowledge—what he called “cognitive capitalism”—became more important than physical labor, but even this often led to more control and stress instead of liberation.

He called for a new way of living: shorter working hours, universal basic income so people are not forced to take any job just to survive, and more time for activities that bring real joy, like art, learning, and caring for others. Gorz wanted us to stop thinking that only paid work gives life value, and instead focus on building strong communities and helping the environment.

In the Hacker News comments, some people agree with Gorz and say their own jobs feel pointless or that work has lost its meaning. Others point out that not everyone can just stop working, and some jobs are still very necessary. A few say that basic income is not practical, or that people need structure and purpose, which jobs can provide. Some users argue that automation and technology could free us from dull work, but only if society changes how it shares wealth and values time. There are stories from readers who changed careers or left jobs to find better balance, but also worries that most people do not have this choice. Some see hope in “multi-activity” and building local communities, while others are skeptical that big changes will happen soon. Many agree that the pandemic made people think more about what matters, but they are divided on what the future of work should look like.
