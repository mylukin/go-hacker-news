Hello everyone, this is the 2025-12-24 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have a range of topics from clever web apps and programming tricks, to big changes in AI hardware, open social networks, and more.

Let’s begin with a neat browser tool called “textarea.” This is a simple notes app that works fully inside your browser. The main idea is that you don’t need a server or an account—everything you write is stored right in the URL. The app is just a text box where you type your notes. As you write, the text is compressed using “deflate,” so even long notes can fit in the URL. The link at the top of your browser holds all your note data. You can copy and share this URL, and when someone else opens it, your note appears. The app also saves notes in your browser’s local storage, so you won’t lose your work if you close the tab. It follows your computer’s dark or light mode, works well on phones, and has a simple design. Nothing leaves your computer unless you share the URL. For titles, just start with “# Title.” If you know how to use browser developer tools, you can even add custom styles. 

Hacker News comments are full of praise for its simplicity and privacy. People like that your notes never leave your browser unless you share them. Some think it’s a fun and easy way to make quick, shareable notes or paste code. However, a few worry about very long URLs, which can be hard to share. There are technical limits—browsers can only handle URLs up to a certain length, so big notes might not work. People also warn not to use it for secrets, since anyone with the URL can see the note. Most users agree it’s great for small notes and no-login use, and many enjoy the clever compression trick. Some wish for more features, but most say its simplicity is what makes it special.

Next, let’s talk about spaced repetition—a proven method for learning and remembering things over time. Instead of cramming, you review facts with longer gaps between sessions, often using tools like Anki or Mnemosyne. Studies show that this works better than rereading or last-minute study. It’s most useful for facts you want to keep for a long time, like languages or medical terms. The best way is to use active recall—try to remember before checking the answer. The science is strong, and people have used it to memorize huge numbers of facts. But it’s not very popular because results are slow and it can feel boring. Many students still cram, even though spaced repetition works better.

In the comments, some users say spaced repetition changed how they learn and helped them remember things for years. Others find it hard to stick with, saying the daily reviews can pile up if you skip a day. Some worry it works only for facts, not for deep understanding. Writing good flashcards is hard, and bad ones can waste time. Others say the real challenge is motivation and knowing what is worth memorizing. People agree it saves time for large subjects, but it’s not a replacement for practice or real-life use.

Moving on, we have a profile of Fabrice Bellard, a famous but low-profile French programmer. Bellard started programming as a child, made a popular compression tool at fifteen, and learned both theory and practice at École Polytechnique. He created fast math algorithms, a new way to calculate digits of pi, TinyGL (a small graphics library), and won coding prizes for tiny C programs. His best-known projects are FFmpeg, which helps convert audio and video, and QEMU, which lets you run programs for one computer on another. He gives his software away for free, likes solving problems, and is known for his humble style.

Hacker News commenters are amazed by Bellard’s skills and the impact of his work. Many say he is a “programmer’s programmer,” doing things for fun, not fame. Tools like FFmpeg and QEMU are now part of daily life for developers, even if few know who made them. People respect how efficient and small his programs are, and wish more programmers would focus on basics. Some share stories of using his tools, and praise how he keeps learning and trying new things. The comments agree: Bellard is a quiet genius who changed computing.

Now, let’s turn to Vibium, a new browser automation tool made by the creator of Selenium. Vibium aims to make browser automation easy for both humans and AI agents. It gives you a single program, “Clicker,” that can start Chrome, connect to it, and let you control it with simple commands. You just install the npm package and it works—no manual setup needed. It supports JavaScript and TypeScript, and you can open web pages, click elements, type text, or take screenshots. Vibium works on Linux, macOS, and Windows, and supports both Intel and Apple Silicon. It’s open source and plans to add Python and Java support soon.

In the comments, people are happy to see a fresh, simple tool for browser automation. They like the easy setup and both CLI and code APIs. Some ask about support for other browsers and note that automatic Chrome downloads might not work everywhere. There is interest in AI agent support, and some wonder about security if the tool is left open. Overall, users are positive and excited to try it.

Next, we have big news in AI hardware. Nvidia is buying Groq, a maker of special AI chips, for about $20 billion. Groq’s chips use a new design called “tensor streaming processor” that runs AI tasks very fast, with less delay. This could help Nvidia stay ahead as more companies try to make their own chips for AI. Groq is still small, but has shown strong results for some language models. The deal is huge, even for Nvidia, and will need approval from regulators.

Hacker News commenters are surprised by the price. Some say Groq’s technology is amazing and could be worth it. Others worry this will hurt competition in AI chips, since Nvidia already dominates the market. Some hope Groq’s team will keep working on new ideas, while a few wish Groq had stayed independent.

Switching gears, there’s an article about very large numbers and Knuth’s up-arrow notation. This special way of writing numbers lets you stack operations—addition, multiplication, exponentiation, and beyond—to quickly reach numbers too big to imagine. One arrow is exponentiation, two arrows make “power towers,” and more arrows make numbers so large there isn’t space in the universe to write them down. The article shares a tool for exploring these numbers and links to Graham’s number, one of the largest numbers used in math.

Comments show a mix of wonder and jokes. Some try to write out the numbers or explain them, others say these numbers are only useful for fun or math puzzles. There is talk about the history of the notation, and a few share links to other tools for big numbers. People say it’s a fun way to learn about how math can grow quickly and surprise us.

Now to programming: Matt Godbolt wrote about how compilers can optimize a simple sum function in surprising ways. He wrote a loop to add numbers from zero to a given value. GCC made the loop faster by adding two numbers at once. Clang did something different—it removed the loop and used the math formula `v*(v-1)/2` to get the answer directly. This is much faster and shows how clever compilers can be.

In the comments, people share stories of compilers doing smart things. Some trust compilers to optimize code and prefer to write clear code. Others warn that you should still know what your compiler does, since optimizations can sometimes cause bugs. There’s talk about aggressive optimizations, and some wonder if AI will make compilers even smarter in the future. Overall, readers are impressed by how much work compilers do for us.

Next, Keystone, a Y Combinator startup, is hiring its first engineer to help build AI tools that find and fix coding errors. Keystone wants to make debugging automatic, using AI to understand your code, check logs, and suggest real fixes. The company offers a high salary, equity, free meals, and equipment, and works with Python, React, TypeScript, Postgres, Redis, and AWS. They have already raised $5.2 million and have early users.

Comments are mixed. Some are excited about AI-powered debugging, while others think it will be hard to beat existing tools. People ask if AI can really fix all bugs, and some worry about new problems or developers missing chances to learn. Others like the idea of less stressful on-call work, and say they will watch to see if the company can deliver.

On the topic of developer tools, there’s a new Bazel plugin called rules_img that makes building Docker images much faster and lighter. The usual way, using rules_oci, forces you to download and move huge files, which slows down builds and CI. rules_img fixes this by only moving small metadata files and only downloading big files when needed. This saves time, bandwidth, and keeps builds predictable. Setting it up is simple, and there are extra features like file deduplication and fast-start layers.

Comments are very positive. People say rules_img solves big problems with slow builds, and they like that it saves time in CI. Some ask about support for different registries and possible hidden costs. There’s talk about technical details, and many plan to try it out soon.

Finally, there are predictions for the open social web in 2026, covering Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads, and the Fediverse. The author thinks user numbers will grow but slower than before. Bluesky may reach 60 million users, Fediverse 15 million, and Threads will keep growing but stay partly closed. WordPress and Ghost may bring more users to the Fediverse. There are bets that a big news site and a major government will join open platforms. Laws might push big networks to support open standards, making it easier for users to move data. There are new tools for discovery and moderation, and a shift away from ads.

In the comments, some agree open social web growth will continue, but others doubt these platforms can beat big tech. Some warn that real user numbers are much lower than registered accounts. There’s debate about laws and open standards, and worries about moderation. Some users are excited about new features, while others think fragmentation could confuse people. Overall, people like the predictions for sparking discussion about the future.
