Hello everyone, this is the 2026-01-13 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we bring you news and discussions on creative hardware, AI at work, simple web building, and more.

First, let’s talk about the Tulip Creative Computer. Tulip is a small, portable computer that you can program with Python to make music, graphics, games, or write text. It is open source and runs on special hardware with a touchscreen, sound, and many ways to connect to other devices. The device boots straight to a Python prompt, so you can start coding right away. Tulip comes with tools for music synthesis, fast graphics, hardware MIDI, WiFi networking, and supports USB keyboards, mice, and sensors. You can buy a ready-made Tulip, build one yourself, use it as a desktop app, or try it online in your browser. The hardware uses an ESP32-S3 chip, runs MicroPython, and includes a rich synthesizer called AMY. Tulip supports sprites, scrolling graphics, editing code on the device, and has a chat and file-sharing system called Tulip World. You can connect to WiFi, use Python’s requests library, and save files from the internet. Battery life is good, and you can connect many I2C devices like joysticks or sensors. There are guides and tutorials to help you get started.

In the Hacker News comments, people liked the idea of a simple, programmable computer for creativity. Some compared Tulip to the Commodore 64 or Game Boy, saying it brings back the fun of learning and making things. Many praised the focus on instant coding and no distractions, thinking it could help kids or adults learn programming and music. The open-source nature and low price got special mention as good for hobbyists. One user loved the built-in synthesizer and MIDI support for musicians. Some people wondered about hardware limits, like RAM and screen size, but thought the trade-offs were fair for a portable device. There were requests for more details on battery life and durability, and some wanted more ready-made apps. Others suggested new features, like better online sharing or support for more languages. Many users liked that you can try Tulip in the browser before buying. Overall, comments were positive, with some users excited to try Tulip themselves or share it with their kids.

Next, we look at Games Workshop and their policy on AI. Games Workshop, the company behind Warhammer, told staff they cannot use AI to make content or designs. Leaders there say they want to protect their human artists and the unique look of their games. The CEO said some managers may study AI, but no one is excited about it. Company rules forbid AI-generated art, writing, or design for Warhammer or other games. They are also careful about AI on work computers and want to keep their ideas and art safe. Games Workshop is hiring more artists, writers, and designers, making sure everything is made by real people. This is important because Warhammer’s art is known for its special style, and fans love that it is made by artists like John Blanche. Last month, there was a big argument when people thought some Warhammer art was AI-made, but the company said it was a human mistake. Games Workshop wants to keep everything human-made to avoid angering fans and to protect their business.

In the comments, many people support Games Workshop’s choice. They say Warhammer’s art and stories feel special because people make them, not machines. Some think AI art is boring or loses the “soul” of the work. Others worry about artists’ jobs or copying real work. Some commenters think Games Workshop is just protecting their copyright, not the artists. There are also voices saying AI might help with small tasks, like checking grammar, but not with main art or stories. A few users feel banning AI completely is too strict and could slow new ideas. Others point out that fans are very protective and would be angry if they saw AI art in official books. For now, most agree that Games Workshop made the right choice to keep fans happy and art unique.

Now, let’s look at a fun problem: can you guess a coin flip better by asking two friends who each lie 20% of the time? If you ask only Alice, you guess right 80% of the time. If you add Bob, who has the same honesty, your accuracy does not get better—it stays at 80%. When Alice and Bob agree, they are probably right, but when they disagree, you cannot know who is correct. The tie cancels out any extra value. The author runs a Python simulation to prove this. With three friends who each lie 20% of the time, your accuracy jumps to 90%, because you can break ties. With four friends, you can get a 2-2 tie again, so accuracy does not improve. This shows that only an odd number of voters helps.

The article links this to Condorcet’s jury theorem: more independent voters with better-than-random accuracy help, but only if you avoid ties.

In the comments, many people liked the example and the mix of math and code. Some recognized the voting theory result, and others discussed real-world uses like peer review, jury decisions, or distributed systems. A few talked about what happens if the friends are not independent or have different lie rates. There was also discussion of Bayesian thinking, and some people joked about their own "lying friends." Readers enjoyed how a simple question led to deeper thinking about group decision-making.

Let’s move to Nogic, a new extension for VS Code that helps you see your codebase as an interactive map. Nogic turns your files, classes, and functions into a visual graph, making it easier to understand how everything connects. You can create custom boards to focus on certain parts, see class diagrams and call graphs, and search quickly. The graph updates as you change code, and you can drag, zoom, and open files from the diagram.

On Hacker News, reactions were mixed. Some users were excited because seeing code visually can help new team members or people working on big projects. Some had tried similar tools before, but found they struggled with big codebases. The custom boards feature was popular for focusing on one part of a project. Some worried about performance on large codebases, and asked which languages Nogic supports. A few said visual tools are most useful for teams, not solo developers. Others warned that seeing all connections can be overwhelming in complex projects. Some hoped Nogic could help spot problems like circular dependencies or integrate with tests and docs. Overall, people found the idea interesting and were curious to try Nogic on their own projects.

Now, let’s talk about making a simple website in 2024. The article says building a website can be easy if you keep things simple. Start by writing your first blog post in plain HTML with a basic text editor. You don’t need a CMS, design, domain, or hosting at first. The example is a small HTML file with a title and one paragraph. Focus on real content, not a fake “Hello World.” Once you write your post, upload it to a server using FTP. If you don’t have hosting, this step is boring but needed. Once your file is online, you have a working website, even if it’s plain.

Next, make a simple RSS feed by hand in XML. This lets people follow your blog in RSS readers. The article explains how to add posts and link the RSS from your HTML. After that, make index pages to link your posts, still using simple HTML. Add a little CSS later, making small updates over time. The hardest part is not technical, but publishing real content. Many people get stuck setting up tools and never write.

In the comments, some agree with the author, saying this is how they learned web development and the basics still work. Others point out this method is good for learning or personal sites, but not for bigger projects. Some liked working with plain HTML and FTP, saying it helps focus on content. There was support for RSS, though some said not many people use it now. A few raised concerns about security, backups, and growing sites, but many agreed: just start, keep it simple, and focus on real content.

Next, we discuss connecting networks using VXLAN and WireGuard. VXLAN creates a virtual network, and WireGuard makes secure, encrypted connections. The question is: should you put VXLAN inside WireGuard, or WireGuard inside VXLAN? The article says people usually put VXLAN over WireGuard—first make a secure tunnel with WireGuard, then run VXLAN on top. This is simpler and easier to manage. It’s also better for dealing with NAT and firewalls, since WireGuard uses one UDP port.

Putting WireGuard inside VXLAN is less common and can make things more complex. Most people agree VXLAN over WireGuard is best. Some use this setup for home labs or small businesses. WireGuard is fast and easy to set up, and VXLAN adds only a little overhead. Someone warns about MTU issues, where packets get too big, but for most people, this is not a big problem. For strong security and simple management, most recommend using WireGuard for security and putting VXLAN on top if you need a virtual network.

Now, let’s talk about using AI coding tools and how they change learning and building software. The author likes using AI to code, but worries it can make people lazy and stop real learning. AI helps you build things faster and try new ideas, but you might stop understanding the code deeply. The author gives some rules: use AI to learn in steps, throw away AI code and start over if needed, break down problems well, make small code changes, and always write docs by hand. AI should help you understand, not replace your thinking.

The workflow is to start messy, plan the problem, build a quick AI prototype, throw it away, then design the solution and use AI to build the final code. The author says writing your own docs and commit messages helps you think clearly.

In the comments, many agree that AI can make you skip deep learning if you aren’t careful. Some say AI is great for boring tasks, but you still need to know the basics to catch mistakes. Others review AI code closely and often throw away drafts. There is debate about using AI for documentation, but most agree humans need to review it. Using AI well takes discipline—you need to know when to trust it and when to do things yourself. Most agree: AI tools are powerful, but you learn best when you use them to help you think, not just to do things quickly.

Finally, we look at Ayder, a new event log and message bus system written in C that uses HTTP for communication. Ayder is a single binary with no big dependencies, supports append-only logs, consumer groups, and high-availability clustering with Raft. It stores data in sealed files and can recover quickly after crashes. In tests, Ayder recovered 8 million messages in about 40–50 seconds, while Kafka could take hours. Ayder’s HTTP API makes it easy to produce and consume messages, manage topics, and handle offsets. It includes a key-value store, stream processing, and works well on ARM64 and regular cloud VMs. You can run it in Docker or build from source, and setup for HA clusters is simple. Ayder is not Kafka-compatible, and does not promise exactly-once delivery, but gives strong durability and is easier to run than most systems.

On Hacker News, many people liked the simplicity and use of HTTP and curl. Some praised the fast recovery and lack of heavy dependencies. Others were excited to try it on ARM laptops or for small projects. Some compared Ayder to Kafka and Redis Streams, pointing out trade-offs: Kafka is more mature but harder to operate; Redis Streams is easy but less durable. There were questions about scaling, security, and missing features, but others said C helps keep things fast and light. Some suggested Ayder could be good for personal projects or small teams who don’t want Kafka’s overhead. Most saw Ayder as an interesting, lightweight tool for event streaming and logging.
