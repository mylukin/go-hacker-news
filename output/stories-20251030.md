## The ear does not do a Fourier transform

- 原文链接: [The ear does not do a Fourier transform](https://www.dissonances.blog/p/the-ear-does-not-do-a-fourier-transform)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45762259)

This article explains that the human ear does not use a Fourier transform to process sound, even though many people think it does. Instead, it shows that the cochlea in the ear uses a special way to separate sound into different frequencies.

Sound waves hit the eardrum and travel through small bones to the cochlea, which is filled with fluid. Inside the cochlea is the basilar membrane, which has different parts that respond to different sound frequencies. The base of the membrane reacts to high sounds, and the tip reacts to low sounds. Hair cells on this membrane move with the vibrations, turning them into electrical signals for the brain.

The ear uses filters to pick out both the time and frequency of sounds. Some filters are good at telling exactly when a sound happens, but not which frequency. Others are better at finding the frequency, but not when it happened. The cochlea’s filters are a mix: at high frequencies, they are better at timing; at low frequencies, they are better at frequency.

A true Fourier transform can find all the frequencies in a signal, but it loses information about when they happened. The ear does not work like this. Instead, its filters work more like wavelets or Gabor filters, which balance time and frequency information.

The article also discusses why this balance is helpful. Studies show that these filters help reduce extra, unneeded information from natural sounds, like speech or rain. Human speech, animal sounds, and nature noises each use different parts of the time-frequency space. This might mean that human speech evolved to fit into a space with less overlap from other sounds.

In the Hacker News comments, many people agree that the ear is not simply doing a Fourier transform. Some say that engineers often use the Fourier transform because it is easy to understand, but nature is more complex. Others point out that the ear’s approach is more like a wavelet transform, offering a better tradeoff between time and frequency.

A few users note that the ear’s method is well-matched to the kinds of sounds we usually hear, like speech and animal calls. Some comment that our brains are very good at picking out important sounds in noisy places, and this is because of how the ear and brain work together. Other people bring up examples from music, saying that musicians can often hear things that standard signal processing tools miss.

Some users wish the article gave more details about how the brain uses these signals after the cochlea. Others mention that understanding the ear can help design better hearing aids and audio software. A few point out that the cochlea’s design is a result of evolution, not of engineers choosing the best method. There are also comments comparing the ear’s function to other senses, like vision, which also use special filters.

Overall, readers find the topic interesting and agree that nature’s solutions are often different from what we use in engineering.

- 原文链接: [Jujutsu at Google [video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9Ob5yPpC0A)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45759572)

This talk is about Jujutsu (JJ), an open-source version control system that works with Git and aims to be both simple and powerful. The video shows a presentation from JJ Con 2025, hosted by Google, where Martin von Zweigbergk explains the system’s design and future plans.

Jujutsu is different from Git but can work with Git repositories. It tries to make version control easier for users by having a cleaner history and better commands. JJ uses a new way of tracking changes, which helps avoid common Git mistakes. The system is written in Rust, which makes it fast and safe. JJ has features like smart branching, easy-to-understand merges, and a way to undo changes safely. The team wants JJ to be friendly for new users but also strong enough for big projects. They plan to add more tools and improve the interface. JJ’s roadmap includes better support for teams, more plugins, and making it easier to use with other developer tools. The project is open source, so anyone can join or suggest features. Google supports this project because they see the need for better version control at scale.

People in the comments have mixed feelings. Some like JJ’s ideas and think it could fix problems they have with Git. A few say JJ is hard to learn or that the talk was slow and hard to follow. One person asks about the work culture at Google and if employees waste time on internal jokes, hinting at worries about productivity. There is some interest in JJ’s future and if it will replace Git for real projects. Some users want more real-world examples or clearer guides. A few worry about changing tools and if JJ can match Git’s reliability. Others are happy to see new open-source tools and want to try JJ on smaller projects first. Overall, the community is curious but cautious, waiting to see if JJ can deliver on its promises.

## Springs and bounces in native CSS

- 原文链接: [Springs and bounces in native CSS](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/animation/linear-timing-function/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45736461)

This article explains how to make spring and bounce animations using only CSS, without JavaScript. In the past, web developers needed JavaScript libraries to create these effects, but now CSS has a new tool: the `linear()` timing function.

The `linear()` function lets you define an animation curve by listing many points between 0 (start) and 1 (end). Instead of using Bézier curves with just a few control points, `linear()` connects all your points with straight lines. This means you can shape very complex motions, like a spring or bounce, by setting lots of points. For example, you can make a spring effect by having the value overshoot past 1 and then bounce back, just like a real spring.

The article shows how simply drawing a spring by hand with a few values does not look smooth; you need many points—sometimes 40 or more—for the animation to feel natural. Luckily, there are online tools, like the Linear() Easing Generator and Easing Wizard, which help you create these point lists quickly. These tools also let you add time percentages to the points, making the animation smoother with fewer points.

There are some limits to using `linear()`. First, CSS animations always need a fixed duration, unlike JavaScript spring animations, which use real physics and can run for any amount of time. Second, CSS transitions handle interruptions (like when you trigger an animation again before it finishes) in a simple way: they just reverse quickly. This does not feel as natural as a real spring, which would slow down and bounce back. Third, having lots of points in the CSS could make your files bigger, but the article’s tests show the size increase is very small and performance is not affected, even with many points.

For best results, the article suggests storing your big `linear()` strings in CSS variables and using them everywhere you need the same animation, instead of repeating the whole string. It also explains how to add a fallback for browsers that do not support `linear()`, using Bézier curves.

In the comments, many people are excited about using spring and bounce animations without JavaScript. Some say this will make their websites faster and simpler. Others worry about browser support, since not all browsers have `linear()` yet. A few mention that writing or editing these long strings by hand is hard, and agree that using tools is the best way. Some think the CSS file size could grow too much if not careful, but others point out that using variables and gzip compression keeps the size small. There are also comments discussing how physics-based animation in JavaScript still offers more realism, especially for things like interruptions and chaining animations. A few readers ask about accessibility, and appreciate that the article mentions respecting users’ motion preferences. Overall, most agree this is a great step forward for CSS and are eager to try the new function in their projects.

## TruthWave – A platform for corporate whistleblowers

- 原文链接: [TruthWave – A platform for corporate whistleblowers](https://www.truthwave.com)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45763858)

TruthWave is a new website where people can report bad actions by companies. It helps whistleblowers share information safely and get paid for their courage.

The site lets you send tips about corporate wrongdoing without sharing your real name. You use secure, encrypted messages to contact TruthWave, and you only give your identity if you want. The platform promises to support you through the whole process, making sure you are not alone. If your tip leads to action and the platform gets money from a case, you get a share—$200 million out of every $1 billion collected will go to people who give tips. TruthWave is looking at big problems now, like healthcare scams, price fixing, financial fraud, pollution, and privacy breaches. Anyone with useful information can submit a tip, and the goal is to make companies act better by exposing their bad behavior.

In the Hacker News comments, some people like the idea and say whistleblowers need more support and protection. Others worry about safety—what if the system is hacked and real names get out? Some users question if financial rewards could lead to false or weak tips, making it harder to find the truth. A few commenters wonder if this platform could help in countries with strict laws or if it will only work in places with strong legal systems. There are discussions about how hard it is to keep things truly anonymous online. Some people think the money offers are too big and may attract the wrong crowd, while others say big rewards are needed because whistleblowers risk a lot. A few users hope this will bring real change, but others are unsure if companies or courts will listen. There’s also talk about if the site can handle big cases and keep user data safe. Some suggest open-sourcing the code for trust, and a few want to see proof that the system actually works.

## Minecraft HDL, an HDL for Redstone

- 原文链接: [Minecraft HDL, an HDL for Redstone](https://github.com/itsfrank/MinecraftHDL)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45763877)

MinecraftHDL is a tool that lets you turn Verilog code into Minecraft redstone circuits. The project started as a final-year student project at McGill University and is meant for learning, not for building the best or smallest redstone machines.

The main idea is that you write your digital circuit in Verilog, a language used by hardware engineers. MinecraftHDL takes this code and builds the same logic using Minecraft’s redstone. For example, you can write a simple multiplexer in Verilog, run it through MinecraftHDL, and get a working redstone version in the game. There are examples showing this, like a 4-to-1 multiplexer and a 2-bit adder. The tool can handle most simple circuits, but it cannot make circuits that need memory or feedback, so things like counters or RAM will not work. The circuits it makes are often bigger and less efficient than what a skilled Minecraft builder could make by hand. MinecraftHDL is best for teaching how digital circuits work and showing the difference between hardware and software. It is a fun way for students and new engineers to see real hardware ideas on a big scale.

In the comments, many people think this project is very creative and fun. Some users remember building large redstone circuits by hand and wish they had a tool like this. A few people point out that the size of the circuits can be a problem because Minecraft can only load so many blocks at once. Others like how the tool uses standard hardware languages, making it easier for students to learn both Verilog and Minecraft redstone. Some users are surprised that the tool does not support memory circuits, but they understand this is hard to do. There are also comments about how this project could help teach logic design to kids in a way that feels more like playing than studying. A few think the circuits are too large and not practical for survival mode, but most agree it is a great idea for education or for showing off in creative mode. Others share links to similar projects or talk about the limits of Minecraft’s redstone. Overall, people like how MinecraftHDL brings together games and real engineering.

## If a pilot ejects, what is the autopilot programmed to do? (2018)

- 原文链接: [If a pilot ejects, what is the autopilot programmed to do? (2018)](https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/52862/if-a-pilot-ejects-what-is-the-autopilot-programmed-to-do)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45765596)

This article looks at what happens to a military plane’s autopilot if the pilot uses the ejection seat. The main question is: does the autopilot try to save the plane, or do anything special, after the pilot leaves?

The answers say that if a pilot ejects, it almost always means the plane is too damaged or out of control to be saved. Ejection is a last choice, and even skilled pilots will only do it if nothing else works. Ejecting also makes the plane harder to fly because losing the canopy and pilot changes the air flow and balance. Autopilot systems in military jets are not designed to land the plane or pick a safe crash spot after ejection. Usually, the autopilot just keeps doing whatever it was doing before, like holding a heading or altitude, if it is still working. Some pilots, if they have time, might set the autopilot to fly straight and level, or aim the plane toward an empty area before ejecting. But there is no standard software in jets that takes over after ejection to try to save the plane or land it. In some rare cases, like special secret aircraft, the military might prefer the plane to destroy itself to keep technology safe, but this is more about burning circuits than a dramatic explosion, and is not common. There are a few stories or jokes about autopilot saying “thank you and goodbye,” but these are not real safety features.

In the comment section, some people joke that autopilot is not needed because the plane is not going to be saved anyway. Others point out that in battle, autopilot is usually off, so it probably is not running when a pilot ejects. A few think it might be smart for autopilot to try to land the plane, but others reply that this could cause more problems, like landing in the wrong place or making it easier for enemies to capture the jet. One person notes that ejecting is very dangerous and often causes injury, so pilots will only do it if the plane is truly lost. Some readers wonder if there is a self-destruct mode in some planes, but others say there is no proof of this, and it is mostly rumor. There are also comments saying that autopilot is not smart enough to handle a damaged plane, but a few reply that modern fly-by-wire systems are like autopilots that always run in the background. Overall, the main feeling is that after a pilot ejects, the autopilot does not do anything special, and the plane is usually on its own.

## 987654321 / 123456789

- 原文链接: [987654321 / 123456789](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2025/10/26/987654321/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45712620)

The article looks at the fraction 987654321 divided by 123456789 and notes it is very close to 8. The writer wonders if this is special to base 10 or if it works in other number bases. He tries base 6 and base 16 and finds similar results: the ratio of big numbers made by putting the digits in order (largest to smallest, smallest to largest) is almost an integer in each base. For any base b, you can make two numbers: one with digits in descending order, and one in ascending order. If you divide the first number by the second, you always get a number very close to b minus 2 (b-2), with a small leftover. The article gives Python code to check this for many bases. The leftover part gets smaller as the base gets bigger. In base 16, the result should be about 14, and in practice, computers round it to exactly 14 because of how floating-point numbers are stored. The writer says this trick has been known for a long time, but he wanted to look at it in detail and show code, not just a math proof. He also says that writing code can help check and find details that might be missed in a proof.

One commenter notices that for base 10, the small leftover looks like 9 cubed divided by 10 to the 10th power, and suggests a formula for the small part in any base. They explain that the formula matches known math sequences and show how the numbers fit the pattern. Another commenter remembers a related calculator trick: multiplying 12345679 by 8 gives 98765432, which is similar to the article’s idea. A third commenter points out that the way the article writes the answer for base 16 can be rewritten using the new formula, making it easier to see the pattern. Together, the comments show that people see both the fun side and the deeper math behind the trick. Some find nice patterns and formulas, others remember math puzzles from the past, and some help make the explanation even clearer.

## NPM flooded with malicious packages downloaded more than 86k times

- 原文链接: [NPM flooded with malicious packages downloaded more than 86k times](https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/npm-flooded-with-malicious-packages-downloaded-more-than-86000-times/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45755027)

Hackers have uploaded over 100 malicious packages to NPM, a popular code library for JavaScript, and these have been downloaded more than 86,000 times. The attack used a weakness in NPM that lets packages pull in extra code from unsafe websites, without developers or security tools noticing.

The security firm Koi found 126 bad packages, with 80 still available when the article was published. The attackers used something called “Remote Dynamic Dependencies” (RDD). This lets a package download and run code from anywhere on the internet, even from insecure websites using HTTP. With RDD, these hidden downloads do not show up in the normal list of dependencies, so developers and scanners often miss them. This makes it easy for attackers to hide their harmful code. Every time someone installs one of these packages, it fetches new code from the attacker’s server. This means the attacker can serve safe code to people they want to avoid, like security researchers, and switch to bad code for real targets. The malware searches infected computers for sensitive data, like passwords for GitHub, Jenkins, and NPM, or environment variables from developers’ systems. It uses several methods to send stolen data back to the hacker, making it very hard to block. Some of the package names were made up by AI chatbots and sound real to developers, which tricks them into downloading the malware. If you use NPM, you should check the list from Koi to see if you are affected.

In the comments, some readers said NPM should better check what packages are allowed to do, and stop RDD from being used this way. Others pointed out that it’s hard to trust any software you download, and that this is a problem for the whole industry, not just NPM. A few people explained that even experienced developers can be fooled, because the bad packages look safe and have zero listed dependencies. Some commenters discussed how AI chatbots can help attackers by making up convincing-sounding package names. Others said that blocking all JavaScript might be safer but is not practical, since so many sites and tools depend on it. Some users shared tips for better security, like only using well-known packages and scanning code before running it. But others replied that even popular packages can be hacked, so there is no easy answer. There was also debate about whether NPM and other code libraries should be made safer by default, or if it’s up to developers to protect themselves. Overall, people agreed the problem is serious and will be hard to fix.

## Show HN: I made a heatmap diff viewer for code reviews

- 原文链接: [Show HN: I made a heatmap diff viewer for code reviews](https://0github.com)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45760321)

Someone built a new tool that shows code changes as a colored heatmap to help with code reviews. The main idea is to make it easy to see which parts of a code change need more careful checking.

The heatmap uses color to show how much attention each line or part of the code should get. It does not only look for bugs. It also highlights things like hard-coded secrets, strange ways of using cryptography, or confusing logic. These are all things that might not be bugs but are important for reviewers to notice.

To use this tool, you just change “github.com” to “0github.com” in any GitHub pull request link. The tool then copies the code into a virtual machine, uses a large AI model called gpt-5-codex to look at every change, and gets back a list of what to highlight. It then shows the results as a heatmap over the code. The heatmap is open source, so anyone can see how it works or help make it better.

In the comments, some people said they liked the idea and wanted to try it. They thought it could help reviewers focus on the “important” lines in big code changes. Others were worried about privacy, since the code gets sent to another server and checked by an AI. Some people asked if the tool could miss important problems if it relies too much on AI. A few wondered about the cost of running gpt-5-codex on every line of code, especially for big projects. There was also talk about how this could fit into other code review tools, and some said they liked that it is open source. Some users were excited to see how accurate the AI is at showing which lines are risky or interesting. Others reminded that, even with tools like this, human code review is still very important.
