- 原文链接: [I analyzed chord progressions in 680k songs](https://www.cantgetmuchhigher.com/p/i-analyzed-chord-progressions-in)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43723020)

The article dives into a massive dataset called "Chordonomicon," analyzing chord progressions from 680,000 songs sourced from Ultimate-Guitar. The author, Chris Dalla Riva, explores this data to uncover patterns in chord usage across different music genres and over time. The dataset shows that G major and C major are the most common chords, especially in genres like country music. It also highlights differences, such as jazz using more complex chords like 7th chords, while genres like rap rarely use them.

The article also examines how chord usage has changed over decades, noting a decline in the use of 7th chords as jazz's popularity wanes. Interestingly, the analysis points out that modern songs might seem less varied in their chord progressions, with a decline in the unique chord rate over time. This doesn't mean music is simpler, as melody and rhythm also play significant roles.

In the comment section, users raised concerns about the analysis's validity. One common critique was the dataset's reliance on Ultimate Guitar, known for user-contributed tabs that might simplify or inaccurately represent the original music. Commenters suggested that using relative chord analysis (like Roman numerals) could provide more meaningful insights into chord progressions. Some noted that the omission of repeated chords in the dataset could skew results, as repeating chords are often essential to a song's structure. Others argued that while the analysis is interesting, it doesn't fully capture the complexity of music, as chords alone don't tell the whole story. Despite these critiques, the conversation highlighted the community's interest in how data can intersect with music analysis.

- 原文链接: [What do I think about Lua after shipping a project with 60k lines of code?](https://blog.luden.io/what-do-i-think-about-lua-after-shipping-a-project-with-60-000-lines-of-code-bf72a1328733)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43723088)

The article is about a game developer's experience with the Lua programming language after completing a project with 60,000 lines of code. This game, called Craftomation 101, is about robots that terraform a planet, and it uses the Defold game engine, which supports Lua.

Ivan Trusov, the lead programmer, chose Lua because Defold offers strong Lua support, and Lua is known for being lightweight and easily integrable with game engines. Trusov found some aspects of Lua surprising, like array indices starting at 1 and the lack of certain operations like "continue" and "increment." He also noted that Lua's "everything is a table" approach was challenging at first, leading to bugs when he forgot that tables hold references, not copies. Despite its quirks, he found Lua's simplicity allowed for straightforward organization of game logic without classes, which suited his preference against object-oriented programming (OOP).

Trusov considered Lua's performance adequate for the game's needs, with few performance issues. He mentioned the option to use C++ for more complex tasks if needed. Although he sometimes felt the lack of static typing was a drawback, he didn't find it a major issue, as he'd worked with dynamic languages like Python before. He thought about using static analysis tools for Lua but didn't prioritize them, focusing instead on improving code organization.

In the comments section, many readers shared their thoughts on dynamic vs. static typing. Some agreed with Trusov's experiences, noting that dynamic languages can be challenging in large codebases due to their lack of compile-time checks, which makes maintenance harder. Others highlighted tools like linters and type hints that can help mitigate these issues, though they acknowledged that static typing often provides more robust safeguards. Some commenters noted that while dynamic typing can lead to flexibility during initial development, it can become a burden over time, especially as projects grow and evolve. Overall, the discussion reflected a range of experiences, with many agreeing that the choice between dynamic and static typing depends on the specific needs and constraints of a project.

## AMP and why emails are not (and should never be) interactive

- 原文链接: [AMP and why emails are not (and should never be) interactive](https://buttondown.com/blog/whatever-happened-to-amp-email)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43725865)

The article discusses Google's AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) and its attempt to make emails interactive, a move that was met with skepticism. AMP for email aimed to allow users to perform tasks like booking flights directly from their inbox. However, it required developers to create multiple versions of emails and authenticate with Google and Yahoo, making it complex and not widely adopted. AMP's broader issues included monopolizing control over web content and dividing the web into mobile and desktop versions, which many saw as a threat to the open web. Over time, AMP's influence faded, though some of its interactive features persist in Google services.

In the comments, many users agree that email should remain immutable and self-contained. They argue that emails should serve as reliable records, unaltered after being sent. Some highlight privacy concerns, noting that emails often link to external sites for information, which can be problematic if links break or require logins. Others discuss technical and market-driven reasons behind AMP's creation, acknowledging that while it aimed to improve user experience, it also served Google's interests. There's a consensus that while AMP's intentions were to streamline user experiences, they often clashed with the established norms and expectations of email and web content.

## The Size of Packets

- 原文链接: [The Size of Packets](https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2024-10/packet-sizes.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43723884)

The article explores the optimal size for internet packets, a question without a clear answer even after decades of using packet-switched networks. Typically, internet packets range from 20 to 1,500 bytes. Smaller packets can truncate headers, while larger ones may face fragmentation, which can lead to packet loss. Historically, the introduction of Ethernet in the 1970s set frame sizes between 46 and 1,500 bytes, balancing speed and efficiency. Ethernet has evolved, but the basic frame sizes have remained unchanged, even as speeds have increased from 10Mbps to 1Tbps.

Geoff Huston discusses how larger packets can improve efficiency but are prone to errors and increased network jitter. Despite technological advancements, the standard packet size remains between 20 and 1,500 bytes, as it is the most reliable size across diverse networks. The article questions whether this size will remain optimal, especially as technology continues to evolve.

In the comments, users share varied perspectives. One commenter recalls a bug caused by packet size changes leading to fragmentation, highlighting how small changes can impact performance. Another suggests simplifying MTU discovery by allowing packets to be truncated, though others counter this could cause issues with data integrity and compatibility across network layers. Some express frustrations with PMTU discovery, noting unreliable behavior from network equipment, like AWS Transit Gateway not sending necessary ICMP messages. Others discuss the practicality of using larger frames in private networks while maintaining smaller sizes for public internetworking to balance efficiency and reliability. Overall, the discussion reflects a mix of technical challenges and practical considerations in network design.

## Unikernel Linux (UKL) (2023)

- 原文链接: [Unikernel Linux (UKL) (2023)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3552326.3587458)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43726037)

The article "Unikernel Linux (UKL)" explores a unique approach to running applications by combining them directly with the Linux kernel. This concept means that an application and the kernel are merged into a single unit, potentially offering performance benefits by allowing the application to interact directly with the kernel's internals.

In this setup, everything, including the application, needs to be recompiled to create a single executable file that contains both the application and the kernel. This approach might seem complex, but it aims to minimize source-level changes for C/C++ programs. For languages like Java or .NET, the runtime would need porting, but the applications themselves might not need modification. The idea here is to optimize performance by enabling applications to bypass certain kernel processes, like the Virtual File System (VFS), when specific conditions are known in advance. A notable example from the paper is improving the efficiency of garbage collection by modifying page tables directly.

This project, however, faced challenges, particularly in securing ongoing research funding, and it hasn't been incorporated upstream into Linux. Despite these hurdles, the concept remains an interesting exploration of performance optimization.

The Hacker News discussion reflects varied opinions. Some commenters see similarities between UKL and existing technologies like containers and serverless computing, noting that these modern approaches have somewhat achieved unikernel ideas, albeit differently. Others are curious about the feasibility and funding for such projects, with one commenter noting that Red Hat and Boston University were involved. There's also a sentiment that traditional methods, like compiling POSIX programs with initramfs, might achieve similar results without the complexity of unikernels. However, a key point made is that UKL's approach offers direct access to kernel internals, which is not typical in standard setups.

In summary, while UKL presents intriguing possibilities for performance, it also raises questions about practicality, funding, and integration with existing systems.
