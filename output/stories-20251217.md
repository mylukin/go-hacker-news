## How SQLite is tested

- 原文链接: [How SQLite is tested](https://sqlite.org/testing.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46303277)

This article talks about how SQLite is tested to make sure it is reliable and safe to use. SQLite is a small database engine used all over the world, and testing it well is very important.

The team uses four main ways to test SQLite: TCL tests, a special test harness called TH3, SQL Logic Tests, and a fuzzing tool called dbsqlfuzz. The TCL tests use scripts to run millions of test cases, checking for many different problems. TH3 is a set of C tests that run on small devices and make sure every possible “branch” in the code is checked. SQL Logic Tests compare SQLite’s answers to other databases to catch mistakes. Dbsqlfuzz changes both SQL queries and database files to look for strange errors.

There are also other small programs that test things like speed, multi-threading, or JSON features. Developers run a fast version of the test suite before every code change to catch most bugs quickly.

Special “anomaly” tests check how SQLite handles problems like running out of memory, disk errors, or even crashing in the middle of a write. These problems are simulated, and the team checks that the database is not corrupted afterward. Compound failure tests look at what happens if two problems happen at the same time.

Fuzz tests send random or weird SQL queries to SQLite to see if it crashes or gives the wrong answer. Google’s OSS Fuzz and other tools are used for this. Some tests also corrupt database files on purpose to make sure SQLite handles bad files safely. Boundary tests push SQLite to the limits of things like the biggest table or longest SQL statement.

When a bug is found, a new test is added to make sure it never comes back. The tests also watch for memory leaks and other wasted resources. The team aims for 100% “branch coverage,” which means every choice in the code is tested both ways. They use special macros in the code to check that important cases are not missed.

Dynamic analysis tools like Valgrind and Memsys2 help find memory or threading problems while SQLite is running. There are even tests to check that database changes are safe if the system crashes or loses power. The team tries to avoid undefined behavior in C, which can cause bugs on different computers.

Before every release, developers check off a long list of manual and automatic tests. They also use static analysis tools, but these find fewer bugs than the other tests. SQLite’s testing is so strong that even though it is open source, it is trusted in many important systems.

In the comments, many people are impressed by how much SQLite is tested, calling it a gold standard for software quality. Some say they wish more projects did this level of testing, especially for important software. A few note that maintaining 100% test coverage is hard and expensive, but agree it makes sense for a tool like SQLite that is used everywhere. Others are interested in the use of fuzzers and ask about finding bugs in real-world situations.

Some developers share their own experiences; for example, one person says SQLite never failed them even after years of heavy use. Another person points out that not all companies can afford such deep testing, but they can still learn from SQLite’s methods. A few people discuss the value of manual checklists, saying that “having a human in the loop” still matters even with good automation. Others ask technical questions about the fuzzing tools or about how crash tests work.

Overall, the comments show respect for the SQLite team and their careful approach to testing. People think this kind of testing builds trust and sets a good example for other open-source projects. Some hope that more libraries will publish their testing strategies like SQLite does.

## Inside PostHog: SSRF, ClickHouse SQL Escape and Default Postgres Creds to RCE

- 原文链接: [Inside PostHog: SSRF, ClickHouse SQL Escape and Default Postgres Creds to RCE](https://mdisec.com/inside-posthog-how-ssrf-a-clickhouse-sql-escaping-0day-and-default-postgresql-credentials-formed-an-rce-chain-zdi-25-099-zdi-25-097-zdi-25-096/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46305321)

This article is about how the author found a way to get remote code execution (RCE) in PostHog by chaining together several security bugs. The story starts with the author’s team testing PostHog before using it, doing a deep technical review instead of just checking features.

The first step was setting up PostHog and learning its architecture. PostHog is easy to install and uses ClickHouse for analytics and PostgreSQL for storage. The author noticed that PostHog supports many external integrations, which means it accepts data from many sources. He found several server-side request forgery (SSRF) bugs that let an attacker make the server send requests to internal systems. One endpoint, meant for testing webhooks, blocked dangerous URLs like “localhost,” but only when tested through the frontend. By sending a direct PATCH request to the backend API, the author could save a webhook pointing to an internal address anyway. When an event happened, the Rust-based worker would send a request to this internal URL without extra checks, making a persistent SSRF possible. 

The SSRF could be used to reach the ClickHouse analytics backend, which runs an HTTP API on port 8123 and usually doesn’t require authentication. ClickHouse supports “table functions” that let you run SQL queries on other databases like PostgreSQL. The author discovered a bug in how ClickHouse escapes single quotes in SQL queries for PostgreSQL: it used a backslash instead of two single quotes, which doesn’t work in PostgreSQL and allows SQL injection. This let him inject his own query and break out of read-only mode. Using PostgreSQL’s “COPY FROM PROGRAM” feature, he could run system commands, like opening a reverse shell to his own server. Since PostHog uses default credentials and container names, the whole attack chain became reliable.

The author thanks the Zero Day Initiative for helping disclose these bugs responsibly. The bugs were reported in October 2024 and fixed by February 2025.

In the comment section, many readers are surprised by how simple missteps can combine into a severe security risk. Some say it is worrying that default credentials and container names are still common in production systems. Others point out that SSRF continues to be a big problem in modern web apps, especially with microservices that talk to each other. A few comment that the ClickHouse SQL escaping bug is a classic example of not understanding the target database’s rules. Some readers praise the author for doing deep, hands-on reviews instead of just trusting marketing. Others argue that software companies should test integrations more carefully and enforce stricter security by default. There are also comments discussing the challenges of safely exposing internal APIs for self-hosted products. One user notes that dollar-quoting in PostgreSQL is often overlooked and can make SQL injection easier if not handled correctly. Some people thank the author for giving clear steps to reproduce the attack, saying it helps others learn to spot similar chains. Finally, a few mention that responsible disclosure and working with security teams is the best way to protect users.

## Show HN: High-Performance Wavelet Matrix for Python, Implemented in Rust

- 原文链接: [Show HN: High-Performance Wavelet Matrix for Python, Implemented in Rust](https://pypi.org/project/wavelet-matrix/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46304413)

This project is a Python package called wavelet-matrix, which is a high-speed data structure for sequences, built in Rust. It gives Python users access to fast rank, select, and range queries, and also supports dynamic updates.

The wavelet matrix is useful for working with large lists of numbers when you want to quickly count items, find the position of items, get the k-th smallest or largest, or get the most common items in a range. Some example commands are wm.rank to count how many times a value appears, wm.select to find the index of a certain occurrence, wm.quantile for the k-th smallest in a range, and wm.topk for the most frequent values. There are also commands for range sums, intersections, and getting min and max values within a range. The package also has a DynamicWaveletMatrix, which lets you insert, remove, or update values on the fly, as long as the value fits within the bit width set at creation. The backend is written in Rust for performance, but you use it from Python. It works with Python 3.9 and newer, and supports both CPython and PyPy. The project is open source under the MIT license.

In the comments, many people are excited to see a wavelet matrix in Python, especially since it is fast thanks to Rust. Some say this is a great tool for competitive programming or for research with large datasets. Others explain how wavelet matrices are powerful for problems with fast rank/select queries, like text indexing or finding frequent elements. A few people ask for more real-world examples or benchmarks to compare with other data structures. Some wonder about the trade-offs, like memory use or when a wavelet matrix is better than a segment tree or B-tree. A few mention that while the interface is easy, understanding the wavelet matrix itself can be hard for beginners. There are also comments about possible uses in bioinformatics, search engines, or analytics. One or two users wish for more documentation or tutorials. Others like that the project is typed and supports many platforms. Overall, the community seems happy to have a modern, fast option for these types of queries in Python.

## I got hacked: My Hetzner server started mining Monero

- 原文链接: [I got hacked: My Hetzner server started mining Monero](https://blog.jakesaunders.dev/my-server-started-mining-monero-this-morning/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46305585)

A server owner found out his Hetzner server was hacked and used to mine Monero, a cryptocurrency. The problem started when he got an abuse email from Hetzner saying his server was scanning networks and could be shut down soon.

He checked his server and saw very high CPU usage. By looking at running processes, he found several programs using lots of CPU, with names like "javae" and "xmrig" (which is mining software). These processes were running as a non-root user (UID 1001), not as the main system user.

The owner manages many services on his server using Docker, including an analytics tool called Umami. He noticed that he had recently redeployed Umami, and this matched the timeline when the mining started. By checking inside his Docker containers, he found the mining software hidden inside the Umami container, in a folder where Next.js (a web framework) files are stored.

He realized that even though he thought he didn’t use Next.js, Umami is built with it. A recent security bug (CVE-2025-66478) in Next.js and Puppeteer allowed attackers to run commands on the server through Umami. The attacker used this to install mining software.

He worried the malware might have escaped the container and infected the main server. But after checking, he found the container was isolated: it ran as a non-root user, had no special privileges, and didn’t have access to the host system. The attack was trapped inside the container.

He fixed the problem by deleting the infected container and turning on a firewall to block unused ports. He sent a report to Hetzner and the issue was closed. He learned some lessons: know what technology your apps and their dependencies use, always use container isolation best practices, and keep systems updated.

In the Hacker News comments, many people agreed with the importance of container isolation. Some said this story shows why you should never run containers as root or with extra permissions. Others pointed out that firewalls and monitoring would have helped catch this faster.

A few commenters said it’s easy to forget that third-party apps use complex stacks, and vulnerabilities can come from unexpected places. Some people suggested using simpler analytics tools or even just parsing server logs, to reduce risk.

One user said updating software is hard but necessary, and others discussed ways to automate container updates. There was also discussion about Docker’s process visibility and how easily people can get confused about what is running on their servers.

Some people were surprised how tricky the malware was, hiding in places that look normal, while others felt it was still “script-kiddy” level and could have been worse. A few suggested stronger network segmentation and even using different servers for different types of services.

Overall, the comments supported the author’s actions and shared similar experiences, with reminders that good security habits—like least privilege, regular updates, and proper monitoring—make a big difference in keeping servers safe.

## AWS CEO says replacing junior devs with AI is 'one of the dumbest ideas'

- 原文链接: [AWS CEO says replacing junior devs with AI is 'one of the dumbest ideas'](https://www.finalroundai.com/blog/aws-ceo-ai-cannot-replace-junior-developers)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46302267)

The AWS CEO says replacing junior developers with AI is not a smart idea, even though many companies are looking to save money with AI. He gives three reasons for this. First, junior developers often use AI tools better than older workers. They grew up with new technology and learn AI skills in school, so they help teams use these tools well. Surveys show younger workers use AI every day and even teach seniors how to use it.

Second, removing junior developers does not save much money. They earn the least, so cutting them does not really help with costs. In fact, some companies that tried this had to spend more later because they lost important people and had to rehire.

Third, if you stop hiring juniors, you break the company’s future talent pipeline. Juniors bring fresh ideas and become tomorrow’s leaders. Without them, there is nobody to train or promote, and teams suffer when older workers leave. This is like a sports team with only old players—when they quit, there is no one to play.

The CEO says AI will change work, but humans will still be needed. AI makes some tasks easier, so companies can build more and enter new markets. Developers will need to learn new things quickly, but jobs will not disappear. In the long run, he believes AI will make more jobs, not less.

Hacker News comments offer many views. Some agree, saying juniors help seniors learn new tech, and removing them hurts company culture and future growth. Others point out that companies often look for quick savings and may not think long-term. A few worry that AI will still lower job numbers, even if not right away. Some share stories of companies letting juniors go and then struggling to fill skills gaps later. Others say it is risky to trust AI too much, as it can make mistakes that humans catch. There is talk about AI making people more productive but not replacing the need for training and mentoring. A few think companies will use AI to replace any role, junior or not, if they can, and warn workers to keep learning new skills. Some worry that if juniors have fewer jobs, it will be harder for people to start careers in tech. In general, most agree that a mix of people and AI is best, and companies need to think about the future, not just today’s costs.

## A Safer Container Ecosystem with Docker: Free Docker Hardened Images

- 原文链接: [A Safer Container Ecosystem with Docker: Free Docker Hardened Images](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-hardened-images-for-every-developer/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46302337)

Docker is making its Hardened Images (DHI)—secure, minimal container base images—free and open source for everyone. This move comes as supply-chain attacks are rising fast, and many companies now depend on containers for their software.

The article explains that DHI images are built to be very secure, small in size, and easy to use. They are based on trusted Linux systems like Alpine and Debian, so developers can switch to them without much trouble. Docker promises full transparency: they show all known security problems (CVEs) and never hide issues. Each image comes with a detailed list of what’s inside (SBOM) and proof of how and when it was built. For big companies or special needs, Docker offers paid options with faster security updates, support for rules like FIPS, and the ability to keep getting patches even after normal support ends.

DHI already helps big businesses like Adobe and Qualcomm meet strong security rules, while helping startups get to market faster. DHI images are now being used with Kubernetes, and Docker is expanding to harden more parts of the stack—like servers for MongoDB and Grafana. Docker’s AI tool can help developers move from older images to DHI with less effort. The company says its goal is to make software safe from the very first step.

Many tech leaders quoted in the article say this is a big win for the open source world and for software safety. They like that DHI is open, trusted, and reduces the work needed to stay secure. Docker also says partners like Google, MongoDB, and security firms are now building on or scanning these images to help even more developers stay safe.

In the Hacker News comments, many people are happy to see Docker making hardened images open and free. Some say this helps small teams who can’t pay for extra security. Others point out that real security is hard, and just using a hardened image is not enough—you still need to update often and check your own code. There’s talk about how Docker’s transparency (showing all CVEs) is better than other companies who hide problems to look “clean.”

A few users are worried about Docker’s long-term plans, asking if this free offer will last or if they might charge later. Some remember past Docker business changes and are cautious. Others wonder how easy it really is to switch to DHI, since some teams have custom needs or old workflows. Several people like that DHI is based on Debian and Alpine, which are familiar for most developers. There’s also discussion about supply-chain attacks, and many agree this move helps lower the risk, but nothing makes software 100% safe. Overall, most comments are positive, with developers glad to have a stronger, open starting point for their containers.
