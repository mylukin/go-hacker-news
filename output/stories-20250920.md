This article is about a new kitchen tool: the world's first ultrasonic chef's knife, made by Seattle Ultrasonics. The company says this knife uses ultrasonic technology to help home cooks cut food more easily and cleanly.

The main product is called the C-200 Ultrasonic 8" Chef's Knife. It has a blade made from Japanese steel (AUS-10), and it is 200mm long. The knife is powered by a battery, which you can charge using USB-C or a wireless charging tile. When you turn on the ultrasonics, the blade vibrates very fast—so it glides through food with less force and less sticking. The company says this means you get cleaner cuts, and it is easier to slice things like cheese, meat, or veggies.

The price is $399 for the knife, or $499 for a bundle with the wireless charger. It is not ready to ship yet—you can only pre-order, with shipping planned for January 2026. You can also buy extra batteries or a special blade sheath. The website has a FAQ and support center, and they promise you can cancel your pre-order any time before it ships.

The knife is made for home cooks, not professional chefs. The company talks about being the first to use this kind of technology for a kitchen knife. They have a “Quantified Knife Project” and a mailing list for updates.

In the comment section on Hacker News, some people are excited about new kitchen tech and want to try the knife. Others are skeptical about the price and wonder if it is really better than a regular sharp knife. Some users point out that ultrasonic knives are used in factories, but they are not sure it is useful at home. A few people worry about cleaning, battery life, and safety. There are jokes about needing to charge your knife, or having to update its firmware. Some think it might help with sticky foods, while others say a good sharp knife already solves most problems. A few users are interested in the tech and materials, but many say they want to see real reviews before buying. Overall, people are curious, but they want more proof it is better than a normal knife.

- 原文链接: [Teardown of Apple 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max (A3365)](https://www.chargerlab.com/teardown-of-apple-40w-dynamic-power-adapter-with-60w-max-a3365/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45289150)

Apple has released a new 40W Dynamic Power Adapter, which can give up to 60W when needed. This small charger is almost the same size as Apple’s older 20W charger, but it charges new iPhones and even MacBooks much faster.

The charger costs $39 and has foldable prongs, making it easy to take on trips. When used with the iPhone 17, it fills the battery to 50% in about 20 minutes. It also supports USB PD 3.0 and can handle several power levels, depending on the device. For example, it charges an iPhone 16 Pro Max at about 27W and a MacBook Air M3 at nearly 56W, reaching its top 60W output.

Inside, the charger is packed with parts that help it stay small, safe, and powerful. The case is tightly sealed and uses graphite pads and foam to keep things cool and protected. The main circuit board is filled with special chips and capacitors. A key chip, made just for Apple, controls the charging process and cuts down on extra parts. There are also special sensors that watch the temperature and lower the power if things get too hot. The power output changes based on what you plug in, so it works with both phones and laptops. The USB-C port is strong and well-attached, and all the parts are from trusted brands.

The overall design aims to provide fast charging in a small, safe package. The charger uses high-quality components and has good insulation and heat management. It is built to last and to work with many different devices.

Hacker News commenters had mixed reactions. Some people were impressed by how much power Apple fit into such a small charger. Others noted that the price is high compared to similar chargers from brands like Anker or UGREEN, which also offer high output and sometimes more ports for less money. A few users liked the dynamic power feature but wished for two USB-C ports instead of one, since many travel chargers now have more than one port. Some praised Apple for using well-known, quality components and for a very safe, well-built design.

Other commenters worried about repairability and e-waste. They pointed out that Apple’s chargers are hard to fix, so if something breaks, you have to buy a new one. Some people said Apple is late to the fast charging game, since other brands have offered similar or better chargers for years. A few users wondered why Apple still sells lower-wattage chargers at high prices when this new model is not much bigger and much better. Lastly, some people were happy to see Apple finally making a charger that fits both travel and high-power needs, but they hoped for more ports and even faster charging in the future.

## Designing NotebookLM

- 原文链接: [Designing NotebookLM](https://jasonspielman.com/notebooklm)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45315312)

This article is about how Jason Spielman designed NotebookLM, an AI-powered note-taking tool, from the first ideas to a full product launch. He explains how his team wanted to solve the problem of “tab overwhelm,” where users have to switch between many tools just to collect and use their ideas.

To fix this, they built NotebookLM with a “three-panel” layout: one panel for your sources (like notes and documents), one for chat with AI (to ask questions or summarize), and one for your outputs (like finished notes or study guides). The design started with lots of sketches and experiments, even some doodled on a napkin, before finding the right structure. The user journey is simple: add sources, chat to process information, and then create outputs—all in one place. The panels can change size and focus, based on what you’re doing, so the tool feels flexible but never confusing. Jason also talks about building special features like “Audio Overviews,” which let users listen to summaries of their notes, and how the team moved fast by listening to user feedback and updating the product quickly. He’s proud that the team worked closely together and that small, fast teams can still build big things at Google. The brand and visuals were made with help from Google Labs, and the whole look and feel was created to match the new way people work with AI. Jason points out that making everything feel natural and helpful was the main design goal.

People on Hacker News had many thoughts about this design. Some users liked the three-panel layout and said it solves the common headache of jumping between too many apps. Others wondered if adding more features could make the app feel crowded or hard to use in the future. A few commenters asked if the AI chat can really understand complex notes and sources, or if it sometimes makes mistakes. Some users liked the Audio Overview idea, saying it’s a good way to study, while others felt audio features might not be useful for everyone. There were also questions about privacy—people wanted to know who can see their data and how it’s kept safe. A few developers were hopeful that Google would keep improving the product, but some were worried that Google might stop supporting it later, as they have with some other tools. Overall, many agreed that making things easier for users, and reducing the need to switch between apps, is a good direction for note-taking and productivity tools.

This article talks about a project called Knitted Anatomy, where parts of the human body, like the cardiovascular system, are made out of yarn by knitting. The website shares images and details of these knitted models, showing organs such as the heart, lungs, and kidneys, as well as the blood vessels between them.

The main idea is to use knitting to make 3D models of body parts. These models include the heart from different sides, the circle of arteries in the brain (Circulus arteriosus Willisi), and the connections between the heart, lungs, and kidneys. The knitted pieces show how blood moves through the body and how different organs connect. The project covers not just the cardiovascular system but also other systems, like the nervous and respiratory systems.

The models are detailed and colorful, making anatomy easier to understand without using real organs or plastic models. This method is creative and can help students and teachers learn in a fun way. Knitting is also soft and safe, which might be useful for teaching children or for use in places where real organs are not allowed. The website includes links to more knitted body systems and information about the artist, Katharina Sabernig.

In the comment section on Hacker News, many readers are impressed by the creativity and skill. Some people praise how the models help make learning anatomy less scary and more friendly. Others mention that handmade models like this can be more memorable than flat images or computer graphics. A few commenters discuss how these models could be useful in classrooms and museums. Some people wonder if this idea could help with other topics, like teaching about diseases or surgery. There are questions about how accurate the models are and if they can show small details. Others share stories of learning with physical models and how it helped them understand complex ideas. A few readers talk about how knitting has been used for other science projects too. Some people just enjoy seeing art and science combined in new ways. There are also jokes and light-hearted comments about getting grandmas to knit biology homework. Overall, the comments show a mix of respect, fun, and curiosity about this unusual teaching tool.

## A revolution in English bell ringing

- 原文链接: [A revolution in English bell ringing](https://harpers.org/archive/2025/10/a-change-of-tune-veronique-greenwood-bell-ringing/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45316744)

The article talks about a big change in English bell ringing, a tradition where people ring church bells in special patterns. The story explains how change ringing grew from a simple act of hitting bells to a complex art using math and careful order.

In the 1600s, English churches added wheels to bells, so ringers could control them better and make new patterns called “methods.” These methods were first written down in a book in 1668, and soon, bell ringing became a fun sport as well as a church activity. To ring a method, each ringer studies their bell’s order in the pattern, moving their place every time, but usually only by one spot. In 2011, Alexander Holroyd created a new method called Stedman Jump Triples, where some bells “jump” more than one place at a time. This was hard work and had been frowned upon by the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers (CCCBR), the group in charge of official rules, because they worried about safety and breaking tradition.

Holroyd and his team performed the new method in 2013, finishing over 5,000 changes in three hours. They sent the result to the CCCBR, but the council did not accept it. Some ringers felt the rules were too strict and blocked creative ideas. Others thought rules made the tradition more interesting and safe. Debates grew heated, with letters and editorials in the main bell ringing magazine arguing both sides. Some people, like Philip Earis, argued for change and more freedom, while others wanted to keep things as they were.

In 2017, after much pressure, the CCCBR started a group to rethink the rules. By 2022, they switched to a system that used a framework instead of strict rules, now allowing jump changes and other new ideas. This meant bell ringers could be creative but still respect tradition. Many people, like Holroyd and Earis, felt this was a big success and finally brought new life to the art.

In the comments, some people were fascinated that bell ringing had so much math and history. A few said they did not know the rules were this strict or that there was so much debate. Some readers liked the idea of tradition, saying rules can make a hobby special and safe. Others supported the new changes, happy to see an old art form become more open and creative. One commenter wondered if this kind of fight between tradition and change happens in other hobbies too. Another person shared their own experience with bell ringing and agreed that trying new things kept them interested. A few were surprised at how passionate the arguments could get over what seemed like a simple activity. Some joked about the “radical” label for people who just wanted to try new patterns. There was also respect for the volunteers who keep these traditions going, even when opinions differ. A handful noted that opening up the rules could help get young people interested in bell ringing again. Overall, commenters enjoyed learning about a part of English culture they had never thought about before.

## Why do some gamers invert their controls?

- 原文链接: [Why do some gamers invert their controls?](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/sep/18/why-do-some-gamers-invert-their-controls-scientists-now-have-answers-but-theyre-not-what-you-think)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45317870)

This article looks at why some gamers choose to invert their controls, meaning they push the stick down to look up, like in flying games, while others use the default way. Scientists studied this topic after many people showed interest, and their answers are not what most thought.

Many gamers believe they invert because of their first games—flight simulators or old consoles—or because of personal habits. The researchers ran tests with hundreds of people, using surveys and special tasks that measured things like how fast someone can mentally rotate shapes or respond to changes on a screen. They found that people’s own reasons, like favorite games or age, did not really explain who inverted controls. Instead, the best way to predict if someone inverts is by looking at how their brain handles 3D space and quick reactions. People who can quickly rotate objects in their head and deal with tricky button placements are less likely to invert. Those who sometimes switch between inverting and not inverting are usually slower in these tasks. Non-inverters were a bit faster, but inverters were sometimes more accurate.

The main point is that control choice is not just about habit or history—it’s about how your brain works with space and movement. The scientists even say that gamers could get better if they try the opposite control style for a while, because the brain can learn new ways. This is like how left-handed people were once forced to write right-handed, but maybe did better if allowed to use their natural hand. The research may help not only gamers, but also people who use machines—like surgeons or pilots—by making controls fit their thinking style.

In the comments, some people compare this to how you scroll on a mouse or trackpad—some like “natural” scrolling, some don’t. A few say it’s great that people can adapt, and that this research could help in real jobs, not just games. Others share their own stories about learning to invert or not and how changing controls was hard at first but possible after practice. Some think the study is interesting because it shows our brains work in ways we don’t always notice. One person points out that different cultures or languages might change what feels “natural” for controls. Another user wonders if games should ask about your thinking style when you start, to pick the best controls. A few gamers say they still feel strongly about their own way, and don’t want to switch. Some comment that it’s cool to see science looking at things that seem small, but touch everyday life. Overall, people are surprised that the answer is about how the brain sees and handles space, not just habit or age.

## After Babel Fish: The promise of cheap translations at the speed of the Web

- 原文链接: [After Babel Fish: The promise of cheap translations at the speed of the Web](https://hedgehogreview.com/issues/lessons-of-babel/articles/after-babel-fish)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45287838)

This article looks at the story of machine translation, starting with Babel Fish, the first free online translator, and moving to today’s AI translation tools. It explains that early machine translators like Babel Fish made many mistakes, especially with word meanings, grammar, and idioms, often leading to funny or confusing results. The author shares examples, like how “Shakespeare’s works” was translated as “Shakespeare’s factories” in Italian, and how “spirit of God” became “the alcohol of God” in Spanish. These errors show that computers often miss context and world knowledge that humans have.

As years passed, new translators like Google Translate switched to using big data and, later, neural networks. These systems are much better, especially for common languages with lots of online data. However, even the best AI translators still have trouble with rare languages, long texts, jokes, wordplay, and cultural references. The article says that while today’s machine translators are great for quick, everyday needs, they struggle with complex or creative writing. Some companies now claim that humans won’t be needed for translation soon, but the author disagrees, noting that machines still make mistakes and don’t understand the deep meaning behind words.

The article also talks about the ethics of translation. Good translation is not just about swapping words; it’s about understanding the author, the audience, and the culture. The author worries that if we trust machines too much, we may lose the value of human translators, who can make careful choices and explain hard ideas. Machine translation also changes how we trust and use language, giving us fast answers but sometimes missing the real message.

In the Hacker News comments, many users remember using Babel Fish in the early days and joke about its funny mistakes. Some are impressed by how much better Google Translate and newer tools have become, saying they now use them for travel and work. Others point out that for important or sensitive documents, like contracts or literature, they still trust humans over machines. A few users work as translators and fear that their jobs are at risk, while others say human translators will always be needed for quality and nuance.

Some comments discuss the limits of machine translation for “low-resource” languages and worry about the loss of cultural knowledge. Others debate if AI can ever really “understand” language, or if it just matches patterns. One user notes that machine translation helps many people communicate who otherwise could not, making the world smaller. Another warns that automatic translation can spread mistakes or even cause harm if people rely on it too much without checking. A few say they hope future AI will solve more of these problems, but most agree that for now, machine and human translators both have a place.

## A brief history of threads and threading

- 原文链接: [A brief history of threads and threading](https://eclecticlight.co/2025/09/20/a-brief-history-of-threads-and-threading/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45317526)

This article explains how Macs went from running just one program at a time to handling many things at once using threads and multitasking. It covers the steps, from the early 1984 Mac that could only run one app, to modern Macs with many CPU cores that run several apps and background tasks together.

At first, the Mac worked with a single processor and no multitasking. When an app needed the system, it paused, let the system do its job, then continued. In 1985, Switcher let users swap between apps, but only one could run at a time. Later, MultiFinder gave Macs cooperative multitasking, where apps had to share the CPU nicely. If an app did not give up control, other apps would freeze. The Mac also used a main event loop to handle user input, but if a task took too long, the system could lock up. 

In 1988, Apple put Unix on Macs, bringing preemptive multitasking, where the system could force apps to share time. The Mac OS got this feature in 1996 and improved it further in later versions. Threads also came, letting one process have many smaller units of work. Threads share memory but have their own stack, and tasks can be run on these threads. 

With dual-processor Macs and Mac OS X in 2000, Apple included different types of threads: Mach threads, POSIX (Pthreads), Java threads, Cocoa’s NSThreads, and more. Each app runs as a process, with its own memory, and can create threads for background work. In 2005, Macs got dual-core processors; later, even more cores were added.

A big change came in 2009 with Grand Central Dispatch (GCD), which manages queues of tasks. GCD decides which tasks run first and can use different rules for priority. With Apple silicon Macs, GCD helps choose between performance and efficiency CPU cores, based on what the task needs. The system now supports up to 32 cores, a huge leap from the old single-core Macs.

In the comments, one user notes that Grand Central Dispatch is named after Grand Central Terminal, not Grand Central Station. The author thanks them and corrects the article. Another commenter remembers using Switcher on older Macs and now prefers using Spaces to organize apps, instead of Stage Manager. They find Spaces easy to use for different app groups and like to keep old habits. The discussion shows that people care about small details, like names, and also remember how they managed multitasking in the past. Some prefer new tools, but others stick with what works for them. There’s respect for the history of Mac multitasking, and some nostalgia for the simple solutions of the past.

## Solving a wooden puzzle using Haskell

- 原文链接: [Solving a wooden puzzle using Haskell](https://glocq.github.io/en/blog/20250428/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45272022)

This article is about using the Haskell programming language to help solve a difficult wooden puzzle. The puzzle is a 5x5x5 cube box that must be filled perfectly with 25 identical wooden pieces, each shaped like a long trunk with a small notch.

The author first tried to solve the puzzle by hand, but found it too hard, so decided to use a computer. Haskell is chosen because it is good for clear and precise modeling of problems. The puzzle pieces and box are made up of small cubes, so the author models the space as a grid of 1x1x1 “voxels,” each with three integer coordinates. Positions are represented as three-number vectors using the `V3 Int` type from the `linear` library.

A single “generic” puzzle piece is described by a list of five voxel positions. To describe where and how a piece can be in the box, the author introduces a `Disposition` type with two fields: a rotation (how the piece is turned) and a translation (where the piece is placed). The article explains how any arrangement is made by rotating and moving the generic piece around.

To find all possible ways to put a piece in the box, the author needs to list all possible rotations and translations. The code creates a list of all possible 3x3 matrices (for rotations) with values -1, 0, or 1, and all translations where each coordinate is between 1 and 5. However, not all of these are valid—some rotations are not real rotations, and some positions put the piece outside the box.

To filter these out, the article gives a function that checks if a matrix is a valid rotation (it must meet some rules from mathematics: its transpose times itself equals the identity, and its determinant is 1). Another function checks if every cube in the piece is inside the box. Only the dispositions that pass both tests are kept.

Finally, the code collects all valid piece placements as lists of coordinates. This sets up the next part, where the author will use these placements to actually solve the puzzle with code.

In the comments, many people liked how the author used Haskell’s type system and libraries to model the puzzle. Some were impressed with the use of mathematical ideas like vectors, matrices, and groups. Others pointed out that brute-forcing all possible placements might be slow, but agreed it was a good way to start. A few readers discussed other ways to solve 3D puzzles, such as using constraint solvers or different programming languages. Some asked for more pictures or diagrams to understand the piece shapes better. There were also comments from Haskell fans who enjoyed seeing real-world problems modeled in Haskell, while a few admitted the math was a bit tough but appreciated the clear explanations. One commenter suggested that, although the approach is technical, it is easy to change and experiment with, which is a strength of functional programming. Overall, readers liked the blend of puzzle, math, and programming, and many were excited to see the solution in the next part.
