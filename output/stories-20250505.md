## Why Archers Didn't Volley Fire

- 原文链接: [Why Archers Didn't Volley Fire](https://acoup.blog/2025/05/02/collections-why-archers-didnt-volley-fire/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43877644)

The article discusses why archers didn't use volley fire, often depicted in films and TV. In movies, we see generals commanding archers to shoot arrows all at once, creating a dramatic scene. But historically, archers didn't shoot in synchronized volleys. Instead, each archer fired at their own pace. The concept of volley fire was more suited to firearms with slow reload times, like muskets, where it helped maintain a constant barrage of shots. Bows, however, could be fired quickly, so there was no need for volley tactics. Also, holding a bow at full draw is exhausting, which is why archers released their arrows quickly after drawing.

In the comments, users share their thoughts on troop discipline and tactics. Some argue that trained soldiers might still act in formation, but not necessarily in perfect unison. Others point out that maintaining a constant stream of arrows is more effective than synchronized volleys, as it keeps the enemy on edge. Commenters also discuss the discipline and training of soldiers, suggesting that while some units might have drilled formations, archers likely aimed for continuous fire to manage fatigue and maintain pressure. Historical examples, like the Battle of Agincourt, are cited to illustrate how archers were used effectively without volley fire. Some users express skepticism about the lack of evidence for archery volleys, but agree that the practical challenges of such tactics make them unlikely in historical contexts.
