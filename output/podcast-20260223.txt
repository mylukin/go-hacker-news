Hello everyone, this is the 2026-02-23 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have stories about surveillance, retro computing, new tools for developers, open-source progress, and a fresh look at Viking history. Let’s get started.

First, in Las Vegas, police have started using Flock license plate reader cameras. What’s special here is that the cameras were donated by the Horowitz Family Foundation, so there was no public vote or input about their use. Normally, if police buy surveillance tech with taxpayer money, there are public meetings and people can share their thoughts. But since these cameras were a gift, police skipped public discussion and oversight. This has made many in Las Vegas worried that democracy is being avoided, and residents did not get a chance to agree or disagree about the cameras watching them.

Flock cameras scan cars, collect data like car color and model, and add it to a large database that hundreds of law enforcement agencies can use. The agreement also lets Flock, the company, use this data for any purpose they want, and they keep the data for up to 30 days. Police say they will not target people based on race or political views, and misuse will lead to discipline. Still, some officers and privacy experts are afraid there is not enough transparency, especially since the rules about using Flock are not published for the public, unlike in some other cities.

There have been cases in the U.S. where police misused Flock cameras to track ex-partners or people they know. Experts warn the cameras could be used to find undocumented immigrants, political protesters, or people seeking abortions. Flock says it does not work directly with immigration enforcement, but it must follow legal requests, so the data could end up with federal agencies. Critics also point out that knowing you are being watched can make people afraid to go to certain places, like clinics or support meetings.

The Horowitz Foundation donated almost $2 million for the cameras and more for supporting software, plus other tech like drones and Cybertrucks. Supporters say these gifts help police fight crime without using public money. But in the comments, many people think private funding is dangerous because it avoids public checks and could lead to abuse. Some say catching criminals is good, especially if it saves tax dollars, but others worry about future costs for taxpayers. Many agree that giving police so much surveillance power without asking the public is risky, especially if the technology spreads to other cities. Some suggest better rules and more transparency are needed, no matter who pays. Developers in the thread think tech like Flock could be useful, but only with strong protections against abuse and clear ways for the public to push back. Once this kind of tracking becomes normal, privacy could be lost for everyone, not just criminals.

This connects to another story: in some U.S. cities, people have started damaging or taking down Flock cameras. These cameras are spreading quickly, taking pictures of cars and license plates all day and night. Police use the data to find stolen cars, track suspects, or check on cars entering an area. Flock Safety says their cameras help keep neighborhoods safe, and many people like them for that reason. But not everyone agrees. Some people worry about privacy and don’t want police watching every car. Others think the cameras might be used in unfair ways. In some places, people have started breaking, covering, or stealing the cameras as protest.

In the comments, some readers support the cameras for helping to solve crimes, while others are worried about too much surveillance. Some say it’s wrong to destroy cameras, even if you disagree, but others feel it’s a form of protest. There is also talk about how easy it is to break or hide these cameras. Many agree the topic is complex, with no simple answer.

Next, let’s talk about age checks on websites. New laws want websites to check user age to keep kids safe online, especially on social media. To really check age, websites ask for government ID or use AI to guess your age from selfies or how you use the site. Many teens do not have IDs, and using selfies or behavior is not always correct. Sometimes adults are blocked for looking too young, and kids find ways around the checks with fake IDs or VPNs. If you appeal, you have to give even more private data, like a copy of your ID or more selfies, and companies keep this data for a long time to show they followed the law.

Big companies like Meta, TikTok, Google, and Roblox already use systems that check age again and again, not just once. This means companies collect and store a lot of data about everyone, not just kids. In places where few people have IDs, like in parts of Brazil or Nigeria, companies use AI to guess your age by tracking your behavior, which means even more surveillance.

Privacy laws usually say companies should only collect data needed for a clear reason and not keep it too long. But forced age checks make companies keep more data for longer, because they need to show proof if the government asks. This clash between privacy and age checks is not something voters chose—it happens because companies want to avoid legal trouble.

In the comments, many readers agree that strict age verification ends up hurting privacy for everyone, not just kids. Some say these laws sound good but do not work in real life, and kids will always find ways around them. Others worry about data leaks, since companies have to store so much sensitive information. A few people point out that lawmakers often don’t understand the technical side and make rules that are hard to follow or easy to abuse. Some think society should focus more on parents and teaching kids, not forcing tech companies to do impossible things. Still, a few say some kind of age check is needed to protect kids, but hope for better, privacy-friendly solutions.

Now, let’s move to retro computing. UNIX99 is a new UNIX-like operating system made for the old TI-99/4A home computer, a machine from the 1980s with only 16KB of RAM and a slow CPU. The creator wrote almost everything from scratch—shell, commands, file management, and user permissions—all squeezed into tiny memory. Many features had to be trimmed or rewritten to fit. There is no multitasking, but it still feels like UNIX.

In the comments, readers are amazed by the technical achievement. Some remember using the TI-99/4A as kids and feel nostalgic. Others compare UNIX99 to other retro-computing projects, and some ask about the real use for UNIX99. One person says working within strict limits helps programmers learn good habits. Another notes that modern systems are very complex, and it is refreshing to see something simple and small. There are also tips and links about similar projects, and some wish for more open-source examples to learn from. A few skeptics doubt anyone will use UNIX99 for real work, but most agree it’s an impressive and fun project.

Another retro story: Shufflepuck Cafe, a game from 1989, has been ported to the Apple II, a computer from 1979. The author explains all the tricks needed to make the game work on old hardware—special math for 3D effects, many versions of each sprite at different sizes, memory tricks, and creative sound handling. The Apple II has very limited memory and slow drawing speed, so the author used fast XOR drawing for some sprites and better-looking but slower methods for others. For sound, there was not enough memory for all effects, so the game only loads what it needs at the moment, and sometimes shortens or splits sounds. There’s even a two-player mode using the serial port.

In the comments, people praise the hard work and creativity. Some remember playing the original Shufflepuck Cafe and are happy to see it on the Apple II. Others say old computers forced programmers to be clever, and this project shows that well. Some ask technical questions about the methods used, and a few suggest small improvements. Most are impressed and inspired.

Next, we have a story about Ladybird, an open-source web browser project. The team is moving parts of its codebase from C++ to Rust, using AI tools to help with the translation. They want better memory safety, and Rust is now mature enough for browsers. At first, Ladybird did not choose Rust because it did not fit well with their C++ code, but now they think the safety and ecosystem are worth it.

Their first target was LibJS, the JavaScript engine. They used AI coding assistants to speed up translation, but humans made all decisions. The new Rust code must produce exactly the same output as the old C++ code. The team ported around 25,000 lines of code in two weeks, much faster than doing it all by hand. Testing showed the two versions matched perfectly. The Rust code still looks like C++ for now, but they plan to clean it up in the future. For now, Rust and C++ code work together.

In the comments, some are excited about using AI to speed up big code translations and hope it will change how we update old software. Some note the Rust code is not idiomatic yet, but understand why. Others warn about mixing C++ and Rust, which can add complexity. There’s also debate about how much AI really helped. Some developers are interested in joining the project now that Rust is used. Many agree that safety is important and see this as a positive step for Ladybird and browsers in general.

Now, let’s talk about PgDog, a tool that helps scale PostgreSQL databases without changing your app code. PgDog acts as a connection pooler, load balancer, and sharding proxy, written in Rust for speed and safety. It allows many clients to connect using only a few real database connections, splits data across servers, and balances queries between main and replica servers. PgDog handles failover and health checks, and supports Docker and Kubernetes for easy deployment. All features are controlled by simple config files.

In the comments, users are excited that PgDog combines pooling, balancing, and sharding in one tool. Some compare PgDog to PgBouncer and Citus, noting that PgDog has more features out of the box. People like that it is open source and written in Rust, but some worry the AGPL license could be a problem for some companies. There are questions about performance, migration to sharding, and the complexity that sharding adds. Many agree PgDog is useful, especially for startups and growing teams, and praise the documentation and examples.

Turning to open-source and AI, there’s a GitHub project called "attesor" that uses AI to reverse-engineer parts of Apple’s Rosetta 2, but for Linux. Rosetta 2 lets Macs with ARM chips run old x86_64 programs. The project tries to recreate key functions, like GF(2^8) multiplication used in cryptography, and AES cryptographic extensions. There’s support for special hardware functions, like SHA-1 and SHA-256 hashing, CRC32 checksums, and random number generation. The project is a work in progress and aims to match Rosetta 2’s behavior on Linux.

In the comments, many are impressed by the effort and skill needed, especially since Apple makes it hard to study their code. Some worry about legal risks, while others hope it will help Linux users run more software on ARM machines. Some doubt the project can ever fully match Rosetta 2’s performance, but are excited to see AI used for reverse engineering. There are questions about whether this could lead to a Rosetta for Windows or other systems, and others discuss the value of open-source learning.

Now, a quick job story: Sim, a startup in San Francisco, is looking for a software engineer to help build its open-source platform for AI agent workflows. The main job is to build a drag-and-drop visual canvas, like Figma but for AI agents, using React, TypeScript, and Next.js. There’s a focus on real-time editing, strong UX, and performance. Sim has grown quickly, with over 70,000 users and 26,000 GitHub stars. Benefits include equity, health insurance, and visa sponsorship. The job is in-person only.

In the comments, some are impressed by Sim’s fast growth and strong backing. Others are cautious about the pressure at a small startup and the in-person requirement. There is discussion about the technical challenges and the trend of “no-code” or “low-code” AI tools.

Finally, new research about Vikings based on ancient DNA shows that being a Viking was more about what you did than who your parents were. Scientists found that Viking groups were made up of people from many backgrounds, not just Scandinavia. Some Vikings had ancestors from southern Europe, the British Isles, and even Asia. “Viking” was more like a job title—anyone could join if they took part in raids or trade. Viking ships carried both men and women, and some leaders were not even from Scandinavia.

In the comments, people found this interesting and said it matches what we know about other ancient groups, like pirates. Some discussed how popular culture gets Vikings wrong. Others pointed out that language and culture can spread without being related by blood. Some wondered what the word “Viking” really meant and how this changes our view of history and identity.
