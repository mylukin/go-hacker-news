## Django: what’s new in 6.0

- 原文链接: [Django: what’s new in 6.0](https://adamj.eu/tech/2025/12/03/django-whats-new-6.0/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46210240)

Django 6.0 has just been released, bringing new features and updates to this popular Python web framework. The main changes aim to make development easier, safer, and more modern for both new and experienced users.

One big new feature is "template partials." This lets you define small pieces of template code in one place and use them many times in the same file, so you do not need to repeat yourself. For example, you can define a form at the top and include it wherever you need it in your template, which keeps your code clean. Another use is for updating parts of a page with tools like htmx, making it simple to refresh just a small section, like a view counter, without reloading the whole page.

Django now has a built-in Tasks framework to handle background jobs, such as sending emails or processing data, outside the main web request. Before, you had to use third-party tools like Celery, which could be hard to set up. Now, you can use the new @task decorator and a built-in API to run tasks. For production, you still need to install a separate package to actually run the tasks, but this is a big first step for Django.

Security is also better in Django 6.0 with built-in support for Content Security Policy (CSP). CSP helps stop attacks like cross-site scripting by telling browsers which content is allowed on your site. You set rules for what scripts, images, or styles can run. Django now makes it much easier to add CSP to your project.

The email system in Django has been updated to use Python’s newer email API. This makes sending emails with attachments and Unicode characters easier and less buggy. It also encourages using keyword arguments for clarity, so your code is easier to read and less prone to mistakes.

Some other small but helpful changes include:
- The shell command now imports common tools automatically, saving you time.
- When you save a model with fields that are generated by the database, Django refreshes those fields right away, so your data is always up to date.
- The StringAgg function, which lets you join values into a string, now works on all database types, not just PostgreSQL.
- By default, new Django projects use a 64-bit primary key, so you don’t need to worry about running out of IDs.
- In templates, you can now use "forloop.length" to get the total number of items in a loop.
- The querystring template tag got better, making it easier to build links with query parameters.

Hacker News users had a lot to say about these updates. Many are excited about template partials, saying it will help make templates much cleaner and easier to manage. Some people think the new Tasks framework is a great start but wish Django would include a full production-ready background worker out of the box. Others are happy Django is finally focusing on background tasks, as this has been a pain point for years.

The CSP support is seen as overdue but very welcome, especially for teams that care a lot about security. Some users note it will help smaller teams protect their sites without extra packages. A few are worried about the learning curve for setting up strong CSP rules, but most agree it’s a step in the right direction.

For the email changes, some developers are glad Django is relying on modern Python tools, while a few worry about compatibility with older code. The move to keyword-only arguments is liked by many, as it helps prevent bugs, but some people say it will require quick fixes in their old projects.

The switch to BigAutoField as the default primary key is widely supported, with users sharing stories of hitting the limit on the old 32-bit field in large projects. The improvements to the shell imports and querystring tag are praised for saving time and making development smoother.

Overall, the community thinks Django 6.0 is a thoughtful release that balances new features, better security, and quality-of-life improvements. Most agree it’s a good time to upgrade, though some suggest waiting for third-party packages to catch up before moving big projects to 6.0.

## 10 Years of Let's Encrypt

- 原文链接: [10 Years of Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/2025/12/09/10-years)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46208962)

Let’s Encrypt has been giving out free security certificates for websites for ten years. The project started in 2015 to help make the web safer by making HTTPS easy and free for everyone.

At first, Let’s Encrypt issued only a few certificates, but now they give out millions every day. Their system is highly automated, so website owners do not have to do much to secure their sites. The team set out to make HTTPS common, and now about 80% of all web traffic is encrypted, with the U.S. even closer to 95%. They have added new features over the years, like support for more types of domains, wildcard certificates, short-lived certificates, and even certificates for IP addresses. As the number of websites grew, Let’s Encrypt had to upgrade their servers and network to handle more data. They also worked to make sure their certificates are trusted by all major browsers, which included partnering with IdenTrust and later creating their own root certificates. Let’s Encrypt wants to make web security so simple that most people never have to think about it. However, this means people might forget how important Let’s Encrypt is, so they ask for support and donations to keep going.

The comment section on Hacker News is full of praise for Let’s Encrypt. Many say it changed the web by making HTTPS free and easy. People remember how hard and expensive it was to get certificates before. Some users share stories about how Let’s Encrypt helped them launch secure sites with little effort. There are comments about the risks of relying on a single certificate authority for so much of the web, but most agree that the benefits outweigh the risks. Some developers wish for even more features, like better support for internal networks and automation tools. Others mention small problems, like the need to renew certificates often, but say the process is much easier now thanks to automation. A few people worry about what would happen if Let’s Encrypt stopped or had a problem, but many trust the team to keep things running. Overall, the community is thankful for the work Let’s Encrypt has done to make the web safer for everyone.

## Mistral Releases Devstral 2 (72.2% SWE-Bench Verified) and Vibe CLI

- 原文链接: [Mistral Releases Devstral 2 (72.2% SWE-Bench Verified) and Vibe CLI](https://mistral.ai/news/devstral-2-vibe-cli)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46205437)

Mistral just released Devstral 2, a new open-source AI coding model, and a command-line assistant called Vibe CLI. Devstral 2 comes in two sizes: a large (123B parameters) and a small (24B parameters) model, both with open licenses, and both aimed at making powerful code automation widely available.

Devstral 2 scores 72.2% on SWE-bench Verified, which is a strong result for an open model, and it’s much smaller and cheaper to run than many competitors. The small version, Devstral Small 2, can even run locally on normal computers, and still scores 68% on SWE-bench. Both models are much smaller than other top models like DeepSeek and Kimi K2, showing that you don’t always need a giant model for good results.

Devstral 2 is made for real-world code tasks: it can work across big codebases, handle multiple files, track dependencies, and even fix bugs by retrying when it finds errors. You can fine-tune it for your favorite programming language or for big company codebases. In tests, Devstral 2 did better than DeepSeek V3.2, but closed-source models like Claude Sonnet 4.5 are still ahead in quality.

The new Vibe CLI tool lets you use Devstral right in your terminal. You can chat with it, get code help, edit files, search, and even run commands—all with context from your whole project, not just one file. Vibe CLI is open source and works with your IDE, with features like autocomplete, history, and easy setup.

Devstral 2 is free for now through the API, but later will have low pricing. The models are designed to work on different hardware: the big model needs data center GPUs, but the small one runs on regular GPUs or even CPUs. There are also partnerships with tools like Kilo Code and Cline, and you can get Vibe CLI as an IDE extension.

In the comments, many people are excited about the strong results for open-source AI, especially the fact that smaller models can now compete with much larger ones. Some users point out that being able to run Devstral Small 2 on local hardware is a big step for privacy and control. There are questions about how practical the models are for daily use, and if they really match the quality of top closed models like Claude Sonnet or GPT-4. Others mention the licensing: some prefer the Apache 2.0 license of the small model over the modified MIT license of the big one.

A few developers share early experiences, saying Vibe CLI is easy to set up and works well for code refactoring and bug fixes. Others worry about GPU requirements for the large model, making it hard for hobbyists to run. Some are hopeful about future local deployment, especially as hardware gets better. There’s also talk about the growing importance of context window size, with 256K being praised for handling big projects.

Overall, there’s a sense that Mistral’s new models are moving open-source AI forward, but people are still watching to see if they can really replace closed-source leaders. Some commenters are already trying out the API and sharing feedback, while others are waiting for more benchmarks and real-world tests.

## If you're going to vibe code, why not do it in C?

- 原文链接: [If you're going to vibe code, why not do it in C?](https://stephenramsay.net/posts/vibe-coding.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46207505)

This article talks about “vibe coding,” where programmers use AI tools to write code, and asks: if you’re going to let the AI do the work, why not just have it code in C or even assembly? The author, a long-time teacher and programmer, explains that while he loves programming, using AI to write code feels less satisfying and even a bit like cheating.

He says that programming is fun because you get to solve puzzles and see your code come alive. But with AI, you don’t always understand what’s happening, which can be uncomfortable. Still, he admits that AI coding assistants really work—they can build complex systems, fix bugs, and do things faster than you might expect. This makes him wonder: if AI is doing the coding, why use languages made for humans, like Python or Rust? These languages are designed to be easy for people to read and write, but the AI doesn’t need that. The computer only cares about code it can run, not if it looks nice to people.

He suggests that maybe we need a new kind of programming language—one made just for AI to use, not for people. This “vibe-oriented programming language” could be more like machine code or assembly, or maybe even something new that mixes human ideas with code the computer likes. He thinks that in the future, programmers might just write ideas or tests, and the AI will build the rest. He feels a little sad that “hand coding” might become old-fashioned, but he’s also excited about this big change in how we write software.

In the comments, many people say they understand his feelings about losing the “craft” of programming, but they also see the benefits of faster, more reliable code from AI. Some agree that most languages today are for people, not machines, and think new tools will change how we work. Others point out that humans will still need to read, debug, and check AI code, so human-friendly languages will still matter. A few are worried about trust and safety: if we don’t understand the code, how can we be sure it’s safe or correct? Some mention that AI is only as good as its training data, which is mostly in popular languages, so moving to a new “AI language” could be hard. Lastly, others are excited by the idea of programming becoming more about ideas and less about details, comparing it to how calculators changed math.

This article is about Bruno Simon’s online portfolio, a 3D website where you can drive a car around to explore his work and learn about him as a creative web developer. The site is famous for its fun, interactive 3D world and clever features.

Bruno built the site using Three.js, a JavaScript library for 3D graphics in the browser. You can move around with your keyboard or game controller, jump, boost, or even honk. The website has secrets and achievements to find, making it feel like a small game. There are also “whispers,” which are short public messages left by visitors, though these only work when the server is online. He shares details about the tech stack: besides Three.js for graphics, he uses Rapier for physics, Howler.js for sound, and special fonts for style. Bruno even made devlog videos on YouTube, showing how he built everything. All his code, minus the server, is open source on GitHub under the MIT license. The music is original, made by Kounine, and is free for anyone to use (CC0 license). He also shares links to the libraries and resources he used.

In the comment section, many people say this is one of the best and most creative portfolios they’ve seen. Some users are amazed by how smooth and fun the 3D driving feels, especially since it’s just in a browser. Others point out that this site is a great way to show off web skills and stand out to employers. A few commenters ask technical questions about performance and how mobile controls work, while others share their own experiences building with Three.js. Some people say the site loads slowly or uses a lot of memory, but most agree it’s worth it for the experience. There are suggestions about accessibility and how to make the site easier for everyone to use. Some wish more portfolios were this playful and bold. A few users say they got inspired to try Three.js themselves or to make more interactive web projects. Overall, the mood is very positive, with developers praising Bruno’s creativity and openness in sharing his work and process.

## Qt, Linux and everything: Debugging Qt WebAssembly

- 原文链接: [Qt, Linux and everything: Debugging Qt WebAssembly](http://qtandeverything.blogspot.com/2025/12/debugging-qt-webassembly-dwarf.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46210806)

This article explains how to debug Qt applications that run in the browser using WebAssembly. The main problem is that debugging these apps can be very hard, but there are some tools that make it easier.

The author says the simplest way to enable debugging is to build your app in debug mode with the “-g” argument or by setting CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug. When you do this, Emscripten puts DWARF symbols inside the wasm (WebAssembly) binary. But this kind of debugging only works in Chrome if you install a special browser extension called "C/C++ DevTools Support (DWARF)." If you use Firefox or Safari, or cannot add extensions, you must use source maps instead, which the author will explain next time.

DWARF debugging lets you see the real source code paths inside the browser’s developer tools. You do not need to set up symlinks as you would with source maps, because the binary already has the paths to your files. Qt, when built for debug, often uses “-g2” for faster linking, but for full debug info, you should use “-g” or “-g3”.

To debug, open Chrome with the extension installed, run your Qt WebAssembly app, and open the console tools. It may take some time to load all the debug symbols, especially if you’re debugging Qt itself. Once loaded, you will see your source files and can set breakpoints, reload the page, and step through your code just like with a normal desktop app. The browser shows you the current line, variable names, and values.

There are no comments under the article itself, but on Hacker News, readers share their experiences. Some people say this kind of debugging is a big improvement compared to the past, when debugging wasm was almost impossible. Others note that the Chrome-only requirement and the need for an extension can be a problem for teams who use different browsers or strict policies. A few mention that while DWARF support is helpful, it can make wasm binaries much larger, so you should only use it in development builds. Some users ask about the speed of loading symbols for larger apps, and others share tips for making the process faster, like keeping the debug info small or using source maps when possible. Some developers wish that Firefox and Safari would add full DWARF support, to make debugging easier everywhere. There are also comments about how this helps new developers learn by letting them step through code visually, and some suggest more documentation or tutorials for people new to Qt WebAssembly. Overall, most agree that while the process is not perfect, it is a big step forward for debugging C++ code in the browser.

## Pebble Index 01 – External memory for your brain

- 原文链接: [Pebble Index 01 – External memory for your brain](https://repebble.com/blog/meet-pebble-index-01-external-memory-for-your-brain)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46205661)

Pebble Index 01 is a smart ring that helps you quickly capture ideas or reminders by pressing a button and speaking into a tiny microphone. The device sends your voice notes to your phone, where they are saved as text or reminders without needing the internet.

The ring is small, like a wedding band, and comes in three colors and eight sizes. You wear it on your index finger, and when you have a thought, you just press the button and talk. The ring only records when you press the button, so it’s private and not always listening. Inside, there’s a microphone, memory, Bluetooth, and a battery that lasts for years—no charging needed. When you’re not near your phone, the ring can store up to five minutes of audio until it syncs later.

The device is made to be simple and reliable. You can use it with both iPhone and Android, and all processing is done on your phone using open-source software. If speech-to-text misses something, you can listen to the audio again. The app works offline, and there’s no subscription needed. You can also set up the ring to do more, like control smart home devices, send messages, or add notes to apps like Notion. The ring is water-resistant and durable, but not meant for swimming.

Pebble Index 01 focuses on privacy and security—nothing is sent to the cloud unless you choose it. The battery is single-use; when it’s low, you send the ring back for recycling and get a new one. It costs $75 during pre-order and will go up to $99 later.

In the comments, many people were excited about the idea and liked the focus on privacy and local processing. Some users thought the long battery life was a big plus, but a few worried about the single-use battery and the need to send the ring back for recycling. Others liked that it does not try to be an “AI friend” or always-on device but just helps you remember things.

Several commenters discussed possible use cases, like setting reminders while biking or cooking, and others compared it to smart rings like Oura but liked that Index 01 is cheaper and does not need charging. Some developers were happy about the open-source software and the ability to customize actions. A few people had concerns about losing such a small device or the practicality of wearing a ring all day.

There were also comments about accessibility—some users thought this could help people with ADHD or memory problems. Others asked about the durability and water resistance, and liked the honest answers. A few wondered if touch controls might be better, but most agreed that a real button is more reliable. Some wanted more integration with other apps, and a few were excited to hack or customize their own uses. Overall, people seemed interested and saw many possibilities for this small, focused device.

## Canada's US Travel Boycott Is Backfiring in the Most Unexpected Way at US Border

- 原文链接: [Canada's US Travel Boycott Is Backfiring in the Most Unexpected Way at US Border](https://www.thetravel.com/canadas-us-travel-boycott-is-backfiring-canadians-face-more-detailed-border-controls/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46210994)

Canada started a travel boycott to the US, hoping to make a strong statement. The article says this boycott is having some unexpected results at the US-Canada border.

The boycott started because many Canadians were unhappy with US policies and wanted to protest by not visiting the US. Some Canadian officials even encouraged people to spend their money at home instead of across the border. But the article explains that this boycott is not hurting the US economy as much as expected. US border towns have seen fewer Canadian shoppers, but many American stores are now focusing more on their US customers. Some shops even changed their prices or started new promotions to attract local buyers.

The article also mentions that some American towns are trying to make up for lost business by hosting local events. Businesses that used to rely on Canadian visitors are finding new ways to survive. On the other hand, Canadian border towns are starting to feel the loss too. Some Canadian businesses that depended on US shoppers are also struggling, and workers who helped with cross-border travel have fewer jobs. People are starting to realize that boycotts like this can hurt both sides.

In the comments, some readers agree with the boycott and say it sends a strong message. Others think it is not very effective and hurts small businesses more than big companies. A few people share stories about border towns changing and adapting to fewer visitors. Some mention that boycotts are hard to keep going for a long time, and people will likely return to old habits. Others say that the boycott may have made border security even tighter, making travel harder for everyone. A few Canadian readers say they now spend more money at home, while some Americans notice less traffic but also enjoy quieter towns. Some commenters believe that both countries need to work together, instead of using boycotts. Others point out that these actions can have consequences nobody planned for.
