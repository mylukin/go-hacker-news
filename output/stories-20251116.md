## The fate of "small" open source

- 原文链接: [The fate of "small" open source](https://nolanlawson.com/2025/11/16/the-fate-of-small-open-source/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45947639)

This article talks about how small open source libraries, like blob-util, are becoming less useful now that AI tools can write simple code on demand. The author explains that many developers now use AI to generate small utility functions instead of searching for and installing a library. For example, if you need to convert a Blob to an ArrayBuffer in JavaScript, AI models like Claude can give you a working function right away—often based on code they were trained on, which might even include the original blob-util code. This makes it faster and easier to get what you need, but it also means fewer people are learning from library docs or tutorials. The author says that when he wrote blob-util, he wanted to teach users, not just solve their problem. He worries that with AI, people might get quick answers but miss deeper understanding. He also notes that browsers and Node.js have added built-in ways to do more things, so small libraries are already less needed. He thinks the best open source work now is in bigger or more creative projects—things that AI can't easily copy, like new frameworks or deep research. He gives examples, like the Ripple.js framework, where humans still do new and surprising things. In the end, he feels that while AI has made many small libraries obsolete, there is still value in open source, especially in new and complex areas.

In the comments, one reader points out that using AI can bring its own risks, like relying on huge, changing models that may have security problems, instead of a small, well-tested library. This reader argues that “klarna koding” (a play on “buy now, pay later”) with AI might create messy code and technical debt, which someone will have to fix later. They believe some developers use AI not because of real risks in libraries, but because they want quick results or feel pressure from their jobs. The commenter also says that AI-generated code is often more verbose and harder to understand. They think that, in the long run, code should be easy for humans to read and maintain, since someone will always need to work with it later. There’s also a view that while AI can help with simple tasks, it might hurt learning and code quality. Some people feel that small open source libraries taught good practices and helped others grow as developers, and losing this could be a problem. Others see the change as normal progress—tools and platforms always evolve, and the best developers will keep finding ways to add value and create interesting things, even with AI in the mix.

## Tracking users with favicons, even in incognito mode

- 原文链接: [Tracking users with favicons, even in incognito mode](https://github.com/jonasstrehle/supercookie)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45947770)

This article talks about a way to track users online using favicons, which are the small icons you see in your browser tab. A project called "supercookie" shows how these icons can be used to create a unique ID for each user, even when they use private or incognito mode. The method works because browsers save favicons in a separate cache, called the F-Cache, which is not easy for users to clear.

When you visit a website, your browser checks if it already has the favicon saved. If not, it makes a request to get it. By setting up different favicons for different paths or pages, a website can check which favicons your browser already has. This creates a pattern that is unique to you, and the website can use this pattern to track you. The tracking works even if you delete cookies, clear your cache, use a VPN, or run ad blockers. It even works across multiple tabs and windows.

Most popular browsers, like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, are affected. Mobile browsers are also vulnerable. The “supercookie” can track almost any user unless they go through special steps to clear the favicon cache, which is not simple. The article says the best defense is to delete the favicon cache files directly, but this is hard for most people.

In the comments, some people are surprised and worried about this new tracking method. They say that privacy is getting harder and harder to protect. Others point out that browser makers should fix this problem quickly by changing how favicon caching works. A few users share tips on how to clear the favicon cache, but agree it is not easy for regular users.

Some commenters think this kind of tracking is clever but also sneaky, and they are upset that incognito mode is not as private as people think. Others ask if browser extensions or privacy-focused browsers can stop this, but most agree those tools don’t help much in this case. A few people debate whether this attack is practical for big tracking companies or just a proof of concept. Some say it shows why web standards need more focus on privacy. Overall, the community feels this is a wake-up call for browser developers and users who care about privacy.

## Heretic: Automatic censorship removal for language models

- 原文链接: [Heretic: Automatic censorship removal for language models](https://github.com/p-e-w/heretic)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45945587)

This article talks about Heretic, a tool that can remove safety or censorship (“alignment”) from large language models automatically. It lets anyone, even people who do not know much about AI, “decensor” popular models with a simple command.

Heretic uses a method called directional ablation, or “abliteration,” which means it changes parts of the model so that it stops refusing to answer certain “unsafe” prompts. It does this by looking at the differences between how the model responds to “harmless” and “harmful” prompts and then uses those differences to find which parts of the model to change. The process is automatic—the tool finds the best settings itself using an optimizer, so there’s no need for expert tuning.

The article shows a table comparing the results of Heretic with other similar tools. Heretic’s results are just as good at making the model answer blocked prompts, but it damages the model’s original abilities less than others (measured by KL divergence). Heretic works with many types of models, including big ones and models that handle images and text. It does not support some newer or more complex models yet.

To use Heretic, you need Python and a modern GPU. You can install it with pip and run it on your chosen model. It works by itself but has options for people who want more control. After running, you can save, upload, or chat with your new model.

Technically, Heretic carefully changes certain “layers” in the model by using “refusal directions.” It can change these settings separately for different parts of the model, which helps keep the model smart while removing refusals. The tool’s main new ideas are flexible ways to change the model and better ways to pick the best direction for changes.

The author lists other tools that do similar things but says Heretic is written from scratch. The project is open source under a free license.

In the comments, many people discuss ethics and risks. Some say this tool can be dangerous, since it makes it easy for anyone to remove AI safety. They worry it could be used for harmful things, or to make the models say bad or illegal things. Others point out that open-source models can always be changed, so this tool just makes it simpler and faster.

A few people argue that “censorship” is not bad—it’s about protecting users and following laws. Some warn that easy decensoring will make companies and governments push for closed-source AI or tighter rules.

Some users are interested in the technical side. They ask questions about how the method works, and if there are ways to detect if a model is decensored. Others think tools like this help with research and free speech, letting people study model internals or avoid over-blocking.

A few comments mention practical issues, like if the tool works with smaller GPUs, or if it can break models by accident. Some users warn that using decensored models could get people banned from hosting sites or make moderation harder.

Overall, the comments show a split: some worry about safety and abuse, while others see value in open tools and research. Everyone agrees it is a strong technical achievement and will have a big impact.

## Dark Pattern Games

- 原文链接: [Dark Pattern Games](https://www.darkpattern.games)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45947761)

The article is about a website called DarkPattern.games, which helps people find mobile games that do not use tricks to make them play or spend money in unhealthy ways. The site explains that many games use “dark patterns”—methods built into games to get players to waste time, spend money, or keep coming back even if they do not want to.

The site lists four main types of dark patterns. First, temporal dark patterns make you spend too much time in the game. Examples include daily rewards, grinding, playing at certain times, and making you watch ads. Second, social dark patterns use your friends and family to pull you in, such as through friend spam or feeling forced to join groups. Third, monetary dark patterns are tricks that lead you to spend more money. Some games use pay-to-win, premium currency, or fake shortages so you feel you need to buy now. Fourth, psychological dark patterns play with your mind, making you feel invested or that you need to complete collections, or that you have control when you really do not.

The website is new and focuses first on iOS and Android games, since these often have the most dark patterns. It has a list of “healthy games” that avoid dark patterns and a list of “dark games” that use many of them. Users are invited to help by leaving reviews of games they know. There are links for more info about each pattern and games ranked by how healthy or dark they are.

In the comments, some people say they are happy to see a site like this, because they are tired of games that feel like slot machines. Others point out that not all game makers want to trick players—some just want to make fun games and need money to keep going. Some developers explain that they feel pushed by big companies to add these tricks, or else their games will not make money or get downloads. Many readers share their own stories about quitting games that used too many dark patterns, or about how hard it is to find honest games these days. Some worry the problem is getting worse, not better, and that big companies do not care. Others hope that websites like this can help players make better choices, and maybe push game makers to be more fair. A few think it is up to parents or users to learn what to avoid, while others argue that these tricks are too sneaky for most people to notice. Some comments suggest ways to label or block dark pattern games in app stores, but others say this would be hard to do. Many agree that talking about the issue is a good first step.

- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45948254)

The article reviews the 20th Anniversary Edition of "The Pragmatic Programmer," a famous book for software developers. It explains how the book helps new and experienced programmers with advice, updated examples, and new topics like security and concurrency.

The book gives practical tips, such as always using version control and not living with broken code. It teaches readers to take responsibility, communicate well, and keep learning. The authors say software should be easy to change, so code should not be repeated and should be organized in small, separate parts. They explain why good names matter and why fixing small problems early stops bigger problems later. The book shows the value of testing, debugging calmly, and using plain text for data. It also talks about design ideas like making code flexible, using interfaces instead of too much inheritance, and keeping important settings outside the code. Concurrency is covered, with warnings about bugs from code running at the same time. The book helps with real-life skills like gathering requirements, working with users, and not just following popular trends but doing what works best for the team. The authors say you should enjoy your work and always look to improve.

In the comment section, many people say the book is a classic and helped them early in their careers. Some say the advice is simple but important, and they recommend it to new developers. Others think parts of the book feel old, even with updates, and mention that some tips are now common knowledge. A few discuss which tips they found most useful, like DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) and the value of communication. Some worry that following every tip can lead to overcomplicated code. Others debate if testing is as important as the book suggests, with some saying experience lets you decide what to test. People also talk about the book’s writing style—some like the short tips, while others wish for more details. A few note that the book is still better than many newer books and is good for both beginners and experienced programmers who want to teach others.

## Z3 API in Python: From Sudoku to N-Queens in Under 20 Lines

- 原文链接: [Z3 API in Python: From Sudoku to N-Queens in Under 20 Lines](https://ericpony.github.io/z3py-tutorial/guide-examples.htm)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45947301)

This article shows how to use Z3, a tool for solving math and logic problems, with Python code. Z3 can help with things like checking software, solving puzzles, and working with math equations.

First, you learn how to make variables and add constraints. For example, you can tell Z3 that “x is greater than 2” and “y is less than 10,” and it will find values for x and y that fit. The article explains how to simplify expressions, work with real and whole numbers, and use options to show results in different ways. Z3 can also handle cases where there is no solution.

You can use logic (AND, OR, NOT) with Z3 to solve logic puzzles or check if something is always true. Z3 lets you add and remove sets of constraints easily, which helps if you want to try different things quickly. You can see if a set of constraints has a solution (“satisfiable”), and if so, Z3 can show what the solution looks like (the “model”).

The guide covers working with big numbers and bit-vectors, which are useful for computer math. You can use list comprehensions in Python to build many variables at once, which is helpful for big problems like Sudoku or the N-Queens puzzle. Z3 can also help with practical problems, like figuring out which software packages can be installed together, based on their dependencies and conflicts.

The article gives examples for physics equations, bit tricks, and puzzles like Sudoku and Eight Queens, showing how Z3 can solve them in very little code. It also explains how to use Z3 locally on your computer.

Hacker News users were impressed by how powerful and flexible Z3 is, especially for solving hard puzzles with just a few lines of Python. Some said it’s great for learning about logic and constraints, and others shared their own small scripts for solving Sudoku or N-Queens. People liked how Z3 makes it easy to model problems without a lot of code.

Some commenters pointed out that Z3 can help with real-world problems, like checking software or package managers, and that learning it can make you a better programmer. Others noted that, while Z3 is strong, it can be tricky to use for very large or complex problems, as it might run slowly or not find a solution.

A few users mentioned that the Z3 documentation can be hard to read at first, but the examples in this tutorial are clear and helpful. Some people discussed how Z3 compares to other tools, like Prolog or SAT solvers, and shared tips for using Z3 in bigger projects.

There were also questions about how Z3 works under the hood, and a few users explained that it turns problems into logical formulas and tries to solve them efficiently. Some users warned that, while Z3 is fun, it’s important to know when to use it, since not all problems fit the “constraints” way of thinking.

Overall, readers liked how Z3 can solve real puzzles and teach logical thinking, but they suggested starting with simple examples before trying big problems.

## What if you don't need MCP at all?

- 原文链接: [What if you don't need MCP at all?](https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-11-02-what-if-you-dont-need-mcp/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45947444)

This article talks about using simple Bash scripts instead of big, complex MCP servers for browser automation with AI agents. The author shares that popular MCP servers like Playwright MCP and Chrome DevTools MCP are heavy, hard to change, and use a lot of tokens.

The main argument is that you don’t always need an MCP server. Instead, you can make small command-line tools using Node.js and Puppeteer. The author explains four basic tools: start the browser (with or without your profile), navigate to a URL, run JavaScript on a page, and take screenshots. These scripts are short and easy to understand. For example, to start Chrome, the script can use your real Chrome profile so you’re logged in. To visit a website, you just run another script with the URL. To evaluate JavaScript, you write your code as a command-line argument. The screenshot tool saves the image in a temp file and prints the path.

The author says that these scripts do everything they need for their job, like scraping websites or working on web apps. They point out that adding or changing tools is simple—just write a new script or edit an old one. They also made extra tools, like picking DOM elements by clicking, or reading cookies. All tools are listed in a README file, which the AI agent can read. This keeps things simple and clear for both the human and the agent.

Compared to MCP servers, these scripts are smaller, faster, and use fewer tokens. They are also composable: you can connect their outputs to other scripts, save files, or do more advanced tasks, all using Bash. This approach saves context space and is easy to keep up to date. The author keeps their scripts in a special folder, makes them available to agents with an alias, and updates the README to help the agent know how to use them. This setup works across different AI agents, not just one provider.

In the Hacker News comments, some people agree and say they also prefer simple scripts over big frameworks. Many like using Bash and small tools because they are easy to change and debug. Others mention that MCP servers try to do too much and are hard to extend. Some users say that for very big or complicated tasks, MCP servers may still help, especially in teams or large projects where structure is important. A few comment that this approach works best for people who know how to code and use the command line. Some warn that handling browser profiles and cookies with scripts can be risky if you are not careful.

Others ask about security, and the author replies that you need to trust your scripts and your agent. There are also comments about using similar setups for other tasks, like database work or file management. Some readers say that this way of working feels more “Unix-like,” following the idea of small, focused tools that work together. Finally, a few note that while this solution is simple and flexible, it does require you to organize and maintain your own toolset, which could be hard for some users.

## I have recordings proving Coinbase knew about breach months before disclosure

- 原文链接: [I have recordings proving Coinbase knew about breach months before disclosure](https://jonathanclark.com/posts/coinbase-breach-timeline.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45948058)

This article is about a Coinbase data breach that happened months before it was officially announced. The author says they have proof that Coinbase knew about the breach much earlier than they told the public.

The story starts on January 7, 2025, when the author got an email about a fake withdrawal from their Coinbase account. Soon after, a woman called, claiming to be from Coinbase fraud prevention. She knew the author’s Social Security number, Bitcoin balance, and other private details. This was not a normal scam—it was too detailed. The author reported this to Coinbase on the same day and got a reply from the Head of Trust & Safety, saying they would investigate. But after that first reply, Coinbase never answered any follow-up questions, even when the author asked how the attacker got private account data.

Four months later, in May 2025, Coinbase said they had just discovered a major breach. They explained that overseas support staff had been bribed to steal customer data, including names, addresses, ID images, and account balances. Coinbase said the breach cost $180–400 million and affected less than 1% of customers. But the author’s experience proves that attackers had this data months before Coinbase said they knew about the problem.

The author provided Coinbase with a very detailed report in January: full email headers, DKIM analysis, the scammer’s phone number, a voice recording of the call, and a list of all the private data the scammer knew. The phishing email also looked very real, passing standard email checks and using Amazon’s email servers. The scammer tried to get the author to move their crypto to a “cold wallet” using Coinbase Wallet, which is a common trick to steal funds. After the call, the author’s phone was flooded with hundreds of spam texts, likely to hide real security alerts.

The article says Coinbase made several mistakes: giving too much data access to outside contractors, not detecting the breach sooner, and ignoring detailed user reports. The author asks why Coinbase only responded after the attackers tried to extort them for $20 million and why earlier warnings were ignored.

The author also gives tips to stay safe: don’t trust caller ID, always check email headers, use app-based two-factor authentication instead of SMS, and demand proper ways for callers to prove who they are. They warn that scammers may know your private details, so always check your account directly and never move funds under pressure.

Now, let’s look at what people in the comments are saying. Some readers believe the author’s story and are shocked that Coinbase ignored such a clear warning. They think this shows why big companies need better security and should pay more attention to customer reports. Others are less surprised, saying it’s common for tech companies to ignore early warnings unless there is big media attention or legal risk.

A few commenters question if the author could have done anything more or if Coinbase’s support team just wasn’t trained to spot such a serious problem. Some worry about how many other customers were targeted, and if Coinbase will ever share the full truth. There are also people who argue that outsourcing support overseas is risky, especially when workers can access so much private data for many users at once.

Other readers point out that the breach shows why people shouldn’t keep large amounts of crypto on exchanges and should use hardware wallets. Some think the real problem is poor internal controls and a lack of transparency from Coinbase. Several are upset that the company only went public after the ransom demand, suggesting they tried to hide the breach as long as possible.

A few try to defend Coinbase, saying all big companies struggle with these problems and that perfect security isn’t possible. But most agree that ignoring detailed user reports for months is not acceptable. Many finish by saying this story is a warning for anyone using crypto platforms or trusting companies with sensitive data.

## I finally understand Cloudflare Zero Trust tunnels

- 原文链接: [I finally understand Cloudflare Zero Trust tunnels](https://david.coffee/cloudflare-zero-trust-tunnels)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45946865)

This article explains how Cloudflare Zero Trust tunnels work and why the author switched from Tailscale to Cloudflare for most of their networking needs. The main idea is that Cloudflare Zero Trust lets you connect private networks, expose private services to the public, and control who can access them, all without worrying about NAT or firewall problems.

The author describes how Cloudflare tunnels (using the tool "cloudflared") act as secure entry points into your network, while the Warp client connects users to the Cloudflare network and enforces access policies. Tunnels are set up on machines inside the private network, and you can configure them to forward requests to different internal services based on hostname or port.

Routes tell the Warp client where to send traffic—like forwarding all requests for a certain IP range through a tunnel. Targets are used to point to specific pieces of infrastructure and can be paired with access policies for more control. Access policies let you decide who can see what, using rules based on email, login method, or if the user is connected through Warp.

The article gives practical examples, such as exposing a home server to the internet using a tunnel and DNS settings, or making a service only available to people logged in through a specific method (like GitHub). You can also set rules to skip the login screen for users already connected to Warp, making access smoother.

The author notes that, unlike Tailscale’s peer-to-peer system, Cloudflare routes almost all traffic through its own servers. This can add some delay, but it removes most networking headaches and allows fine-grained control over security. There are also tips on deploying the Warp client, setting up enrollment policies, and adjusting advanced settings like device checks.

From the comment section, some people say they have also struggled to understand Cloudflare’s many features and found this guide helpful. Others mention they prefer Tailscale for its better speed and simplicity in small setups, but Cloudflare is a good choice for more complex situations or when NAT problems are hard to solve.

A few users worry about putting too much trust in Cloudflare as a single provider, especially for sensitive home networks. Some point out that while Zero Trust is powerful, it can be overkill for basic use cases. Others like the access controls, especially for teams who need to share services securely.

There are questions about the best ways to handle SSH access and whether Cloudflare’s approach is more secure than just using VPNs. Some users share tips for mixing Tailscale and Cloudflare in the same network to get the best of both worlds. Finally, people appreciate the real-world examples and wish for more step-by-step guides for common setups.
