## Fran Sans – font inspired by San Francisco light rail displays

- 原文链接: [Fran Sans – font inspired by San Francisco light rail displays](https://emilysneddon.com/fran-sans-essay)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46025942)

This article is about Fran Sans, a new font inspired by the old LCD displays on San Francisco’s light rail trains. The writer, Emily Sneddon, explains how these train signs are special because of their simple, mechanical look and how they capture the unique style of San Francisco.

Emily noticed that the city’s transit signs use many different fonts, but one stood out: the LCD displays inside the Muni’s Breda Light Rail Vehicles. These signs use a grid made from basic shapes—squares, quarter-circles, and angles—to make each letter. The style is a mix of utility and charm, much like other things in San Francisco, such as the Golden Gate Bridge’s color or the city’s steep streets. Emily visited the workshop where the signs are repaired and learned how each sign works: operators enter a code, and the display lights up certain segments to spell out the destination. These signs were made by a company called Trans-Lite in 1999, and the alphabet for the display was designed by an engineer, just for the needed destinations. Some letters, like Q and X, don’t even exist in the system.

Inspired by this, Emily created Fran Sans. She broke the letters down into modules, like building blocks, and made a full set of uppercase letters, numbers, and some punctuation. Some symbols, like the @, don’t fit well in the grid, and there are no lowercase letters yet. Fran Sans has three styles: Solid, Tile, and Panel. Emily wanted the font to show the same versatility as other famous fonts, being useful for many moods or uses. She also got inspiration from old modular typefaces in the Letterform Archive in San Francisco. Sadly, the original train signs that inspired Fran Sans are being replaced by modern LED signs, and Emily hopes her font helps people remember the old style and its imperfections.

In the comments, many people say they love the idea of making a font from real city details. Some share their own memories of seeing the old train signs and feeling nostalgic about them. Others discuss how the new LED signs, while better in some ways, feel less personal and charming. A few commenters talk about the difficulty of fitting all letters into a small grid, and how this limitation creates interesting design choices. Some designers in the thread praise the process of breaking down letters into modules and say it’s a good way to learn about typography. Others wonder if Fran Sans could be used for other things, like signs or digital displays in games. One comment points out that losing these old signs is part of a bigger pattern, where cities slowly lose small details that make them unique. But others are happy that Fran Sans can now keep some of that character alive. Finally, some users ask technical questions about how Emily made the font and what tools she used, and Emily replies, sharing more about her design process.

## Native Secure Enclave backed SSH keys on macOS

- 原文链接: [Native Secure Enclave backed SSH keys on macOS](https://gist.github.com/arianvp/5f59f1783e3eaf1a2d4cd8e952bb4acf)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46025721)

This article explains how macOS can now create and use SSH keys that are protected by the Secure Enclave, without needing extra tools. Secure Enclave is a special chip inside your Mac that keeps secrets, like your fingerprints or private keys, safe from the rest of the system.

You can make a new SSH key that requires Touch ID by running a simple command in the terminal. The key is stored inside the Secure Enclave, so the secret part never leaves the chip. You can list, view, or delete these keys with more commands. When you want to use the key for SSH, you can "download" a reference to it (not the real secret) and copy the public part to your server. The key works with regular SSH, and you just need to set a special option to tell SSH where to find the Secure Enclave. You can also use these keys with ssh-agent for easier access. If you want to make things even simpler, you can set an environment variable, so all your SSH tools know where to look for the keys. For people who need to back up or move their keys, there’s also an “exportable” option, which lets you encrypt your private key using the Secure Enclave and move it to another device.

Hacker News commenters are excited about this new feature. Many people like that you no longer need third-party apps like Secretive. Some think it’s great for security, since the private key never leaves the Secure Enclave and you need your fingerprint to use it. Others mention that it’s now easier to use FIDO2 keys (like Yubikeys) and Secure Enclave in a similar way. A few users worry about what happens if your Mac breaks or you lose access to Touch ID—the keys might be gone forever. Some ask if this feature works on older Macs or only the newest models. There’s also talk about using these keys for other things, like signing Git commits. A few people point out that while exportable keys are handy for backups, they might be less secure than the default option. Others wonder about using this feature in teams or with shared computers. Finally, some hope that Apple will make this feature clearer and easier to find in future macOS versions.

## 780k Windows Users Downloaded Linux Distro Zorin OS in the Last 5 Weeks

- 原文链接: [780k Windows Users Downloaded Linux Distro Zorin OS in the Last 5 Weeks](https://blog.zorin.com/2025/11/18/test-the-upgrade-from-zorin-os-17-to-18-and-celebrating-1-million-downloads-of-zorin-os-18/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46026579)

A Linux system called Zorin OS just hit 1 million downloads in a little over a month, and most of these downloads—780,000—came from people using Windows. The Zorin team is also letting users upgrade from Zorin OS 17 to version 18 without losing their files or settings, though this upgrade is still being tested.

The main points are: Zorin OS is becoming popular, especially with Windows users who want something different. Tech reviewers say Zorin OS 18 looks very polished and is a great choice for people moving from Windows. The new version keeps things familiar, with a look and feel close to Windows, which makes it easier for people to switch. Reviewers from ZDNET, XDA Developers, and PC World all praise how easy it is to use and how much it looks like Windows. The upgrade from version 17 to 18 lets people keep their apps and settings, so they don’t have to start over. But, right now, only users of certain Zorin OS 17 editions can try the upgrade, and it’s not recommended on important computers just yet. Users should back up their files before upgrading, as there might be bugs or issues during this early testing time. The upgrade will become easier and safer for everyone soon, once the testing is done.

In the Hacker News comments, many people are surprised by the high number of downloads from Windows users. Some say this shows that more people are looking for alternatives to Windows, especially after recent changes to Windows or concerns over privacy. Others are skeptical, wondering if download numbers really mean people are switching or just trying out the system. Some users suggest that Zorin’s Windows-like appearance is a big reason for its success. Others point out that many Linux systems have tried to attract Windows users before, but keeping those users long-term is hard. A few commenters share positive stories about switching to Zorin or helping friends move to Linux using it. Some people discuss technical details, like how easy the upgrade process is or how stable the new version might be. Others warn about possible problems during upgrades, especially while the new system is still being tested. A few say that, even if only some people switch, it’s still good for the Linux community. Overall, the comments show excitement, but also some doubts and technical caution.

## Calculus for Mathematicians, Computer Scientists, and Physicists [pdf]

- 原文链接: [Calculus for Mathematicians, Computer Scientists, and Physicists [pdf]](https://mathcs.holycross.edu/~ahwang/print/calc.pdf)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46024773)

This book is about calculus for people who want to understand both the calculations and the ideas behind the math. The author wants to help students learn not just how to solve problems, but why the methods work.

The book starts with the basics: what mathematics is, the idea of sets and logic, and how math is different from science. It explains that math is about ideas and rules, not just about the real world. The author uses examples from computer science, like bits and logic gates, to show how math can be abstract and built from simple ideas. Sets, numbers, and functions are introduced step by step, with lots of examples. There are explanations of how math uses logic, definitions, theorems, and proofs to make sure everything is clear and correct.

Calculus itself is shown as more than just a tool for science—it is also a subject with deep theory. The book explains how calculus helps us describe change in the world, like the speed of a falling stone, but it also teaches us how to think about infinity and very small things in a careful way. The difference between intuition and proof is a big theme: it’s not enough to guess or feel what is true; in math, you must prove it. The author gives analogies, like learning to use radar when flying a plane, to show why learning the theory is important.

The book is organized to go from basic ideas (sets, numbers, logic) to more advanced topics (limits, continuity, differentiation, integration, sequences, and series). Each chapter builds on the last, and there are many figures and examples. The author often stops to discuss the meaning of mathematical ideas, not just how to calculate answers.

In the comment section on Hacker News, many people liked the focus on both theory and applications. Some said they wished their own calculus classes had used a book like this, because it balances proofs and real-world uses. Others praised the clear writing and the way abstract ideas are connected to programming and computer science. A few said the book is good for self-learners or for those who want to really understand the “why” behind the math, not just the “how.” Some readers warned that the book is more challenging than a typical calculus course, but also more rewarding. A few commenters debated if the book is too theoretical for beginners, but others replied that the mix of intuition and rigor is just right. There was also a discussion about the importance of learning to prove things, not just memorize formulas. Some people shared their own experiences of struggling with math until they learned about logic and proofs. Overall, the comments show that the book is seen as a strong resource for anyone who wants to truly learn calculus, especially people in math, physics, and computer science.

## Shaders: How to draw high fidelity graphics with just x and y coordinates

- 原文链接: [Shaders: How to draw high fidelity graphics with just x and y coordinates](https://www.makingsoftware.com/chapters/shaders)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46023013)

This article talks about how you can use shaders to draw detailed graphics using only x and y coordinates. It focuses on how shaders work, and how you can make complex images without big image files.

The article explains that shaders are small programs that run on your computer’s graphics card. They work by calculating the color of each pixel on the screen. For each pixel, a shader gets its x and y position, then uses math to decide what color it should be. This means you can make shapes, patterns, and even pictures just by using math and the pixel’s position.

Some simple examples are drawing circles, lines, and gradients. For a circle, the shader uses the distance from the pixel to the center of the screen. If the pixel is close enough, it draws it as part of the circle. For lines, you can use math to check how close a pixel is to a line’s path. The article also shows how you can mix colors and shapes together to build more complicated graphics.

The author points out that this method is different from drawing with images or bitmaps. Instead, everything is made fresh by the shader each time it runs. This makes graphics smooth and sharp at any size, because they are not limited by pixel resolution. The article also explains that shaders can be used for animations by adding time as another variable.

Many shaders use simple math like addition, multiplication, and trigonometry (like sine and cosine). The article gives some code examples to help you get started. It also suggests using online tools like ShaderToy to play and learn more.

In the Hacker News comments, some people are excited about the power and flexibility of shaders. They say that learning shaders helped them understand graphics and math better. Others mention that writing shaders can be hard at first, because you need to think differently compared to normal programming.

Some users warn that shaders can be tricky to debug, since you can’t easily see what’s happening inside them. Others share tips, like starting with simple shapes before trying to make complex images. A few people talk about how shaders are used in games and movies for special effects.

There are comments saying that shaders are great for making art, and some post links to their own shader experiments. Some users discuss performance, noting that shaders run very fast on graphics cards but can slow down computers if written badly. Others mention that shaders are now used in web browsers, which makes them easier to learn and share.

Finally, some users ask for more beginner-friendly resources, and people reply with links and advice on how to start learning shaders.

## Racket v9.0

- 原文链接: [Racket v9.0](https://blog.racket-lang.org/2025/11/racket-v9-0.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46023460)

Racket 9.0 has been released, bringing a big update for people who use this programming language. The main new feature is support for parallel threads, which means Racket can now run code at the same time on different processor cores more easily.

Before, Racket had green threads (which are managed by the language and only run on one core) and other ways to do parallel work, like "futures" and "places." But now, with parallel threads, it's simpler to get real parallel processing. You can make parallel threads with a special option called `#:pool` when you create a thread. If you want to save what a thread does to look at it later, you can use `#:keep` set to `'results`, and then use `thread-wait` to get the results.

Some other updates in this release include a new "black-box" wrapper, which helps make sure the compiler doesn’t remove parts of code you want to measure in benchmarks. There’s also a new function called `decompile-linklet` that lets you turn Racket’s “linklet” code back into its original form. The `processor-count` function now always returns the correct number of parallel cores in the "BC Racket" version.

Packages for AArch64 (a kind of computer chip) can now be tested more easily, and the program that checks code syntax is now smarter about finding names deep in code. The math library now has support for Weibull distributions, and there are many small bug fixes and better documentation.

Many people in the Racket community helped with this release, and the team is inviting more people to join and contribute in the future.

In the Hacker News comments, many people are excited about the new parallel threads. Some users say this has been a long-requested feature and will help Racket keep up with other languages that already have real parallelism. A few are curious about how parallel threads work compared to Racket’s old futures and places, and they hope it will make writing fast programs in Racket simpler.

Some users discuss technical details, like how the new threads handle shared data and what limits there might be. A few people mention possible problems with thread safety and how garbage collection will work with parallelism. Others are happy about smaller things, like the better math library and the improved syntax checker.

A couple of users wish for even more support for new hardware or easier ways to build packages. Some point out that Racket is still a great language for learning and experimenting, and these updates make it even better. There are also comments thanking the development team for their hard work and for keeping Racket as an open and welcoming project. Overall, the reaction is very positive, with some healthy discussion about what could come next.

## Mount Proton Drive on Linux using rclone and systemd

- 原文链接: [Mount Proton Drive on Linux using rclone and systemd](https://github.com/dadtronics/protondrive-linux)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46024584)

This guide shows how to mount Proton Drive as a folder on Linux using rclone and systemd. It helps users access their Proton Drive files like any other local folder after logging in.

The setup starts by installing fuse3 and rclone (version 1.64.0 or newer). rclone is the tool that connects to Proton Drive; fuse3 lets Linux mount the drive as a folder. You configure rclone to link with your Proton Drive account, following prompts in the terminal and logging in through your browser. A script called setup-proton-mount.sh does most of the work for you. It creates a folder called ProtonDrive, sets up a systemd user service to mount it at login, and makes sure your system has the needed fuse settings. The script may add you to the fuse group, which means you need to log out and back in. After finishing, you can check if your Proton Drive files show up in the new folder. The guide explains how to check the service status and where logs are saved. There are also steps to remove everything if you want to uninstall it. All the steps should work on most Linux distributions, not just Arch Linux.

In the comments, many users are happy to see Proton Drive can be mounted on Linux. Some people mention that rclone adding Proton Drive support is a big improvement, since before it was not possible without hacks. A few users say setup is easy for people who know Linux, but beginners might find fuse and systemd confusing. Others explain that mounting cloud drives with fuse can cause problems with some apps, especially if the network is slow or the mount disconnects. Some comment that systemd user services are the right choice, making the mount happen at login without needing root. There are questions about security, like if the drive is safe from other users on the system when using --allow-other. One user says this method is more private than using Google Drive, and that Proton Drive fits people who care about privacy. Someone asks if file syncing works well, or if it is only good for simple backup. A few users share tips, like using rclone mount options to make things faster, or explain that other cloud drives (Dropbox, Google Drive) can be mounted this way too. Lastly, some people wish Proton would make an official Linux client, but agree this guide is a good workaround for now.

## "Good engineering management" is a fad

- 原文链接: ["Good engineering management" is a fad](https://lethain.com/good-eng-mgmt-is-a-fad/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46026939)

This article says the idea of “good engineering management” changes a lot over time and is often just a passing trend. The author looks back at their own career and explains how what companies want from managers keeps shifting, not because of deep moral reasons, but because business needs change.

In the late 2000s, managers were not expected to have lots of one-on-one meetings or help with personal growth. Instead, they focused on finding key opportunities and moving the team forward. By the 2010s, when tech companies were growing fast, managers were told to focus on hiring and keeping engineers happy, and to stop writing code themselves. But now, after big changes in the economy and with new tech like AI, companies want managers to be hands-on again. The article explains these shifts mostly happen because of changes in business, like the economy or company growth, not because of some new moral lesson.

The author believes if you want to be a good manager for a long time, you should learn basic skills that matter in any era. These skills are: getting things done (execution), helping your team succeed (team), taking responsibility (ownership), and making sure everyone understands the plan (alignment). There are also growth skills: having good judgment (taste), being clear (clarity), handling unclear problems (navigating ambiguity), and working both short- and long-term (working across timescales). The article gives questions to help managers check how strong they are in these areas.

But, it’s tricky—sometimes a skill that’s important one year is less important the next. So, managers need to keep a wide range of skills and be ready for change. The article also says it’s important to do work that keeps you energized, even if it’s not always the most “impactful.” Finally, the author says you should think about your whole career and make choices based on your own goals, not just what the company wants right now.

In the comment section, some people agree that management trends are always changing and that business needs are the real reason for these shifts, not values or morals. Others say that even if trends change, things like clear communication and being responsible are always important. A few readers point out that it’s hard for managers to know what to focus on, since the rules keep moving. Some think the article is too negative and that there are real improvements in how companies treat engineers. Others say that focusing on “core” skills is good advice, and that being able to adapt is key for survival in tech. A few people share their own stories about being told to stop coding, then later asked to code again. Some worry that calling everything a “fad” makes it hard to care about doing a good job. Other readers feel that it’s just part of working in tech—you have to be ready for the industry to change, and keep learning.

## Editing Code in Emacs

- 原文链接: [Editing Code in Emacs](https://redpenguin101.github.io/html/posts/2025_11_23_emacs_for_code_editing.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46024032)

This article explains how to set up Emacs for editing code efficiently, focusing on building good habits and using consistent keybindings. The author describes their own Emacs setup, which uses a custom modal editing system—meaning there are separate modes for moving around and for typing text, similar to Vim. The goal is to keep your hands on the keyboard, avoid using the mouse or arrow keys, and move through code quickly using commands instead of lots of typing or clicking.

The setup encourages the use of modal editing: in command mode, most keys help you move around the code, while insert mode is for typing. Switching between these modes is quick, and there are special keys for moving to the start or end of a line, jumping by words, or jumping over code blocks (called s-expressions). The author’s modal system is lightweight and mostly sticks to Emacs conventions—so if you use default Emacs, you won’t get lost.

To help with navigation, the setup includes leader keys. For example, ‘v’ is a leader for file and window commands, while ‘k’ is for cut/copy/paste actions. You can combine these with other keys to do things like save files, search, or kill (cut) text. Moving around code is done by lines, words, blocks, or even searching for a string, and there are shortcuts for each. The author also uses registers as temporary bookmarks, and the ‘mark’ system to jump back and forth between places in the code. For editing and deleting code, there are keybindings for killing words, lines, blocks, or regions. Macros, commenting, undo, and rectangle editing (editing blocks of text) are all supported with simple commands.

The author prefers using as few extra packages as possible, but does recommend some—like ‘ag’ for searching across a project, ‘magit’ for Git, and ‘diff-hl’ for showing changed lines. The setup is not meant to be better than Vim; the author just prefers Emacs because it’s familiar.

In the Hacker News comments, many users appreciate the detailed explanation and agree that modal editing can be very fast when you get used to it. Some say they also use evil-mode (a popular Vim emulation in Emacs) or similar systems and find them helpful. Others are worried about heavy customization—if you change too much, it can be hard to use someone else’s Emacs setup, or even your own after a break. Several readers mention that learning Emacs (or Vim) takes time, but once you build muscle memory, it’s hard to switch to anything else. A few people say they prefer default Emacs bindings or simpler setups, and find modal editing confusing.

There are comments about the trade-off between customization and portability: some like having a setup that’s just right for them, while others want to stick with defaults for easier switching between machines. A couple of users point out that Emacs has a steep learning curve, so this kind of setup is best for experienced users or those who spend a lot of time programming. Some discuss the pros and cons of using external packages—too many can slow things down or break after updates, but some (like magit) are worth it. Finally, a few commenters mention that modern editors like VSCode are catching up on these features, but Emacs is still powerful for those who invest the time to master it.
