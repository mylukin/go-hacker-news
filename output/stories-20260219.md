- 原文链接: [Gemini 3.1 Pro](https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/models-and-research/gemini-models/gemini-3-1-pro/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47074735)

Google just announced Gemini 3.1 Pro, their newest AI model for hard and complex tasks. This update is rolling out for developers, companies, and everyday users through tools like the Gemini API, Vertex AI, Gemini app, and NotebookLM. Gemini 3.1 Pro is better at reasoning than before; for example, it scored 77.1% on the ARC-AGI-2 benchmark, which is much higher than the last version. The model can help explain tough topics with clear visuals, pull together data into easy views, and even create code for things like animations or creative websites. Some demos show Gemini 3.1 Pro building animated SVG images from just text, making a live dashboard to track the International Space Station, and coding a 3D bird flock you can control with your hand. It can also turn the feeling of a book like "Wuthering Heights" into a modern website design. Right now, the model is in “preview,” so Google can get feedback and improve it before a full release. If you have a Pro or Ultra plan, you get higher limits and earlier access.

People in the comment section bring up many points. Some are excited about the jump in reasoning skill and hope this means AI can help more with science or code. Others wonder if these high benchmark scores really match real-world use, or if Google picked tests that make their model look good. A few ask about privacy and if their data is safe when using Gemini 3.1 Pro, especially in business settings. There are developers saying the API and tools are easy to use, while some wish for more open models and less “black box” behavior. Some note that while demo videos look great, real projects often hit bugs or weird results with these models. A few users are excited about the creative uses for art and design, but others want to see stronger results on basic tasks like math or logic puzzles. Finally, some people ask about cost, hoping that better AI will not mean higher prices, and they hope Google keeps improving speed and reliability as well.

## AI is not a coworker, it's an exoskeleton

- 原文链接: [AI is not a coworker, it's an exoskeleton](https://www.kasava.dev/blog/ai-as-exoskeleton)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47078324)

This article says we should not think of AI as a new coworker but as an exoskeleton that makes workers stronger. The main idea is that AI should help people do their jobs better, not replace them.

The author shows how real exoskeletons help in factories, the military, healthcare, and even running. For example, at Ford factories, exoskeletons helped reduce worker injuries by 83%. Soldiers can carry more weight with exoskeletons, but they still decide where to go. In hospitals, people who could not walk can walk again with exoskeletons. These machines do not do the work alone; they help people do more and avoid getting tired or hurt.

The article says that many companies hope AI can act like an "agent" and do jobs by itself, but this often fails. AI does not know all the details about a company or a product. It misses important things, like what features are important or why prices are set a certain way. The author’s company, Kasava, built an AI platform that helps people find patterns and problems in code, customer calls, and product data. But the AI does not make final decisions—humans do. The AI finds useful information, and people use their judgment to act on it.

Kasava uses a "product graph," which is a map of all the information about a product. Some of this comes from the code and project history, and some comes from people telling the AI what is important. Together, this helps teams make better choices. The AI is like an exoskeleton: it gives people extra "strength" for thinking and analyzing, but people still control what happens.

The author gives advice: break jobs into smaller tasks and use AI to help with the boring or hard parts, like writing code comments or searching for problems. Let people make the big decisions. Build small AI tools that do one thing well and let people see exactly what the AI is doing. This makes it easier to fix problems if something goes wrong.

The article says the real benefit of AI is not to replace workers, but to help them avoid boring work, reduce mistakes, and save energy for creative or complex work. Over time, these small boosts add up. The best future is not AI working alone, but AI and people working together, like a person wearing an exoskeleton.

In the comments, many people say they like the exoskeleton idea. Some share stories about AI tools that help them do small tasks, such as writing emails faster or finding bugs in code, but they still want control over the final result. Others warn that some companies try to use AI to cut jobs or costs, and that can cause problems when the AI makes mistakes or does not understand the real situation. A few people think that, one day, AI might be able to do more by itself, but for now, it is better as a helper.

Some commenters say the exoskeleton model is safer because it keeps people in charge, while others point out that it requires good design so people know what the AI is doing. There are also worries that if companies try to use AI as a full replacement, they may get poor results and upset employees. Some technical readers like the idea of using "micro-agents"—small, focused AI tools—because they are easier to trust and fix when something breaks.

Overall, most readers agree that AI works best as a tool to help people, not as an independent worker. They say it is important to keep humans "in the loop" to make sure things go well. Some hope that more companies will use the exoskeleton model in the future.

## Show HN: Micasa – track your house from the terminal

- 原文链接: [Show HN: Micasa – track your house from the terminal](https://micasa.dev)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47075124)

This article is about Micasa, a tool that helps you track everything about your house from the command line. It works in your terminal, stores data in a single SQLite file, and does not use the cloud or require an account.

Micasa lets you track home maintenance, projects, incidents, appliances, vendors, quotes, and documents. You can see when you last did things like change a furnace filter. The tool helps you plan projects, showing progress from the idea to completion or if you drop the project. You can compare quotes for work, see vendor histories, and know real costs. Each appliance can be tracked—when you bought it, if it’s under warranty, and its maintenance history. For problems like leaks, you can log incidents, link them to appliances or vendors, and mark when they are fixed. You also get a vendor directory with contact info and job history. Documents like manuals, invoices, and photos can be attached to projects or appliances; all files are stored inside the SQLite file. Micasa runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows, with easy setup using Go or by downloading a binary. Data can be backed up simply by copying the database file. The interface uses Vim-style keys, so you can browse, edit, sort, and search with the keyboard. The tool was made because the creator was tired of tracking home stuff with random receipts and sticky notes.

In the comments, some people really like the idea of a local, terminal-based tracker that does not need a cloud service. Others say they want mobile support or a web interface, since they do not always use the terminal. A few mention that it is great for privacy because everything stays on your computer, but some worry about losing data if the file is lost. Some users ask if it can be used for other things, like tracking office assets, and the creator answers yes—it is flexible. There are comments praising the Vim-style controls, but some wish for mouse support too. A few people share that they already track home things with spreadsheets or notes, but like how Micasa puts everything together. Others ask about syncing across devices, and the answer is that you can use syncing tools, but there is no built-in sync. Some mention that open source is a big plus, while others wonder if non-technical users will find it hard. Finally, several users thank the creator for sharing a tool that solves a real problem in a simple way.

## Micropayments as a reality check for news sites

- 原文链接: [Micropayments as a reality check for news sites](https://blog.zgp.org/micropayments-as-a-reality-check-for-news-sites/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47078167)

This article talks about how micropayments—small, quick payments—could help news sites make money in a world where most people read from many different sources. The writer explains that, unlike the old days of print news, people now read articles from all over, but often do not pay for subscriptions, so news sites lose money.

Micropayments could let readers pay a little for each article, turning small bits of attention into real income for news sites. This would not replace ads, but add another way for sites to prove real people are reading, which helps sell ads for more money. The article notes that mobile games already make micropayments work by having users buy in-game coins first, then use those coins to get game items. This two-step process makes spending money feel easier, and could work for news too.

If even half of readers paid for some articles, it would give sites better records to show advertisers. But, there is a problem: if sites switch to micropayments, some subscribers might cancel and only pay for a few articles, cutting income. One idea is to give coins to subscribers as a bonus and let them share or use them more widely, just like how games give free coins to keep people playing.

The article also warns that big tech companies try to control how ads are measured, which can hurt independent news sites. If news sites want to survive, they need to give advertisers better, more honest ways to see who is really reading. The writer suggests that micropayment data could help with this, but news sites need to move fast.

Some readers on Hacker News think micropayments will never work for news because people are used to free content and do not want to deal with small payments. Others say the mental effort of paying for each article is still too much, even if the system is smoother. A few point out that big tech firms and their ad systems have too much power, making it hard for small sites to change the rules.

Some like the idea, saying it could help fight fake news and AI-generated junk by showing which sites have real, paying readers. Others warn that it could make news harder to get for people without much money or those who read a lot from many sites. There is also worry about adding more pop-ups or steps before reading, which can annoy users even more.

One commenter suggests that giving free coins or credits to start could help people get used to the idea. Another says that micropayments could work if bundled into browser tools, so people do not have to think about it each time. Some are hopeful, but most agree there are many hard problems to solve before micropayments can save news sites.

## Show HN: Ghostty-based terminal with vertical tabs and notifications

- 原文链接: [Show HN: Ghostty-based terminal with vertical tabs and notifications](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47079718)

This post is about “cmux,” a terminal app for macOS based on Ghostty, with special features for AI coding agents. The main idea is to make it easier to work with many coding agents and get clear notifications inside your terminal.

Cmux lets you organize your work using vertical tabs in a sidebar, showing info like your git branch, folder, open ports, and the latest message for each tab. When an AI agent, like Claude Code, needs your attention, you see a blue ring and the tab lights up. There’s a notification panel to see all your messages at once and a shortcut (Cmd+Shift+U) to jump to the latest unread message.

A big feature is the built-in browser. You can open a browser pane right next to your terminal and use it with scripts, so AI agents can click, fill forms, or check your dev server. The app is scriptable: you can use its CLI or a socket API to make new tabs, split panes, send keys, or control the browser. Cmux is a real macOS app written in Swift and AppKit, not Electron, so it’s fast and uses little memory. It uses your Ghostty config for themes and colors, and drawing is fast thanks to the GPU.

The README lists many keyboard shortcuts for working with tabs, panes, splits, the browser, and notifications. You can install cmux by downloading a DMG or using Homebrew. The project is open source under the AGPL-3.0 license.

In the Hacker News comments, some people like the idea of vertical tabs and built-in notifications, saying it solves real problems when working with many AI agents or coding sessions. Others ask how cmux is different from tools like tmux or iTerm2, and if it’s really needed. Some prefer native apps over Electron for speed and lower memory use, so they like that cmux is written in Swift. A few users want to see versions for Linux or Windows, or hope for more Ghostty-based terminals on other systems.

There are users who worry about learning new keyboard shortcuts or moving their workflow from tmux. Some ask about the scriptable browser feature and how it helps with coding agents. A few people want to know if cmux works well with remote development or if it can be used for teams. One person points out that notification rings and the notification panel could make multitasking with agents much easier.

Some commenters feel AI-focused features are too specific for their needs, while others say the sidebar info (git, ports) is helpful for all developers. Overall, people are interested in the project, but want to try it themselves to see if it fits their style.

## A terminal weather app with ASCII animations driven by real-time weather data

- 原文链接: [A terminal weather app with ASCII animations driven by real-time weather data](https://github.com/Veirt/weathr)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47076659)

This project is a weather app for the terminal that shows ASCII animations based on real-time weather. It uses Open-Meteo for live data and can display things like rain, snow, thunderstorms, airplanes, day/night cycles, and more. The app picks your location automatically using your IP address, but you can also set your location by hand. You can install it with Rust’s Cargo, from the AUR on Arch Linux, or with Nix flakes. The app has lots of options: you can choose units (Celsius, Fahrenheit, etc.), hide the information display, or even run it in silent mode. There are also ways to simulate weather, like forcing rain or snow animations for testing. Keyboard controls are simple—press “q” or Ctrl+C to quit. The app supports color or no color (for accessibility) and checks your terminal to see what features it can use. Your location can be private if you turn off auto-location, as then it will not call outside APIs. The code is open source under the GPL-3.0 license, and it gives credit for the ASCII art it uses. It’s mostly written in Rust, with a bit of Nix for packaging.

In the comments, many people say they love seeing fun and useful tools for the terminal. Some praise the smooth ASCII animations and how it brings life to a text interface. Others mention they like that the app works well without tracking users, as you can turn off auto-location. A few users compare it to other weather tools like “wttr.in,” and discuss which one they prefer for daily use. Some developers say they want to see even more weather types or extra keyboard shortcuts in future versions. There’s also talk about how nice it is to have a cross-platform tool, since it works on Linux and macOS, with easy install options. One person likes that it’s open source and hopes it stays that way. Another commenter wonders how hard it would be to add support for Windows. A few users mention the possible problem with external APIs for auto-location, but others are glad it can work offline with manual coordinates. Some wish for more simple features, like a plain text-only mode for very old terminals. Overall, most people in the discussion are excited about the project and happy to see more creative terminal apps.

## Archaeologists find possible first direct evidence of Hannibal's war elephants

- 原文链接: [Archaeologists find possible first direct evidence of Hannibal's war elephants](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/archaeologists-unearthed-a-2200-year-old-bone-they-say-it-could-be-the-first-direct-evidence-of-hannibals-legendary-war-elephants-180988185/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47077245)

Archaeologists have found what may be the first direct evidence of Hannibal’s war elephants. Hannibal was a famous general from Carthage who led elephants across the Alps to fight Rome over 2,000 years ago. In this new discovery, scientists found a bone in Italy that they say comes from an African elephant, not a local European species. The bone was found at an old battle site where Hannibal’s army fought the Romans. This supports ancient stories that Hannibal used elephants in battle. Before this, no one had found clear proof from the battle sites themselves. The scientists used special tests to check the age and type of the bone. They compared it with other elephant bones to be sure. The results fit with the time of the war between Rome and Carthage. The bone’s shape and size also match African elephants, which were rare in Europe. This shows that Hannibal really did bring African elephants with him. Elephants were important in ancient battles because they scared horses and soldiers. This finding helps us better understand ancient war history.

People in the comments are excited about this discovery. Some say it is great to have physical proof for old stories. Others note that sometimes ancient writers made things up or got details wrong. A few people discuss how hard it must have been to move elephants over the Alps. Some wonder if more bones will be found in the future. One person says this helps bring history to life. Another asks about the science used to test the bone, and others share facts about different types of elephants. There is also debate about how many elephants Hannibal really had. Some users worry about how animals were treated in war. Many agree that this is a big step for archaeology and history.

## America vs. Singapore: You can't save your way out of economic shocks

- 原文链接: [America vs. Singapore: You can't save your way out of economic shocks](https://www.governance.fyi/p/america-vs-singapore-you-cant-save)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47074389)

This article looks at why many older people in America and Singapore wish they had saved more money for retirement. It compares the popular idea that people don’t save enough because they procrastinate, with a new idea that unexpected economic shocks—like job loss, health problems, or divorce—are the real reason for regret.

The article shares research from surveys of people aged 60–74 in both countries. The results show that procrastination and poor self-control do not predict who regrets not saving more; in fact, people who say they never procrastinate sometimes feel even more regret. What really matters is whether someone has faced a major negative financial shock. In the US, 69% of people reported at least one serious shock, compared to 46% in Singapore. Americans who faced these shocks were much more likely to regret not saving, especially if they had several shocks. In Singapore, regret stayed about the same no matter how many shocks someone had. 

The difference comes from how each country’s systems work. Singapore forces people to save a big part of their income for retirement, health, and housing, using special accounts that can only be used for certain things. This means people have safety nets before problems happen. Singapore also works hard to keep older people employed, so losing a job is less common and less damaging. The US, on the other hand, has a weak unemployment system, health insurance is often lost with a job, and not everyone even has a retirement account through work. When bad things happen in the US, people often lose both income and health coverage, so their savings take a big hit.

The article also points out that Singaporeans still have regrets about saving, but the reasons are different. Most regret comes from the shock itself, not from failing to save due to bad habits. The research found that being good at understanding probability (knowing that bad things can happen and planning for them) led to less regret in both countries, while basic financial knowledge didn’t have the same effect. Having a longer-term plan and more wealth also helped, but only up to a point.

Now, looking at the Hacker News comments, many readers agreed with the article’s argument that life events, not just habits, make saving hard. Some people shared stories about how a single medical bill or job loss wiped out years of careful saving. Others pointed out that US systems are confusing or unfair, making it harder to recover after a shock. A few users said that forced saving in Singapore sounds harsh, but most agreed that having safety nets in place before trouble starts is better than hoping people will always save enough on their own.

Several commenters discussed the limits of “nudges” like automatic enrollment in retirement plans. They argued that these tools help, but can’t protect against big, unexpected problems. Some readers noted that in both countries, people still wish they had saved more, showing that no system is perfect, but the US could learn from Singapore’s approach. Others worried about the risk of over-relying on forced savings, especially for low-income people who need more help. A few comments stressed the importance of teaching people to plan for risk, not just manage money, since understanding uncertainty seems to reduce regret the most. Overall, the discussion supported the article’s message: you can’t save your way out of every problem—sometimes, you need help from bigger systems.

## We're no longer attracting top talent: the brain drain killing American science

- 原文链接: [We're no longer attracting top talent: the brain drain killing American science](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/19/trump-science-funding-cuts)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47079222)

This article talks about America losing its best scientists to other countries. It says fewer top students and researchers want to stay in the US or move there for work.

The article explains that, in the past, America was a top place for science and technology. Many smart people from around the world wanted to study and work in the US. Now, that is changing. Other countries, like China and some in Europe, are investing more money into science. They offer good jobs, better pay, and better support for researchers. Because of this, talented people are choosing to stay in their own countries or move somewhere else instead of the US.

The article gives examples of scientists who left America to work in other countries. It says that rules for getting work visas in America are getting harder, so new scientists cannot stay after studying. Also, getting money to do research in the US is difficult, and there is too much paperwork. Some researchers feel there is more freedom and less stress outside the US. As a result, American universities and companies cannot find enough good people for important jobs. The article worries that, if this continues, America will fall behind in new technology and big discoveries.

In the comments, some people agree and say they have seen good scientists leave the US. They say the visa process is slow and confusing. Others mention that research jobs in America do not pay enough and offer little job security. Some people think America is still a great place for science, but the problems are getting worse. A few point out that science is growing fast in other countries, so it makes sense that talent spreads out.

Other commenters think the US government should make it easier for skilled people to stay and work. Some say the focus on short-term profit in American companies hurts long-term science. One person worries that losing top talent will hurt everyone, not just America. Another says the US still has top schools and labs, but needs to work harder to keep them strong. Many agree that fixing visa rules and giving more support to research would help keep talented people in America.

There’s a piece about making PyTorch’s memory planning more efficient with special tricks for the knapsack problem, saving lots of RAM.

Projects like AgentRoam show how AI models can move around in video games using screenshots and prompts, while another article explores using autoencoders to spot phishing domains without needing lots of labeled data. There’s a quick tour of large language models (LLMs), explaining how they learn, how they’re tested, and how to run them at home. Some writers test LLMs for cybersecurity work, like mapping attack techniques from reports, and find that accuracy is still mixed—no model is perfect, but they can help humans work faster.

Other topics include encoding data with playing cards, hiding information in zero-width Unicode characters, and sending secret data out of locked computers using audio tones generated by AWK scripts. There are also articles on B-trees for faster serialization, the details of IDA project files, and the limits of true “free software” using Signal as an example.

In the comment section, readers praise the range and depth of topics, calling it a “treasure chest” for hackers. Many like the focus on practical tricks, such as the AWK modem and card-based encodings, and appreciate the clear, hands-on style. Some debate the usefulness of certain security articles, suggesting that while AI is helpful, it cannot replace human review. Others discuss the open-source nature of Paged Out!, with a few wishing for easier access to article sources or translations. Several users share their own experiences with similar projects, or suggest future topics, like more hardware hacking or deeper dives into compiler design. A few raise concerns about the accessibility of dense technical language, hoping for more beginner-friendly summaries. Overall, the magazine is seen as an inspiring resource that balances cutting-edge research, fun hacks, and community spirit.
