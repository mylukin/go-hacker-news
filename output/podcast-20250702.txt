Hello everyone, this is the 2025-07-02 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have stories about AI earbuds with big security holes, a retro moon phase website, best practices for web links, a possible ancient impact in Louisiana, a CSS glass effect generator, Quaker and Zen meditation, the latest Go cache libraries, new gene therapy for hearing loss, and how Escher’s art connects to complex software.

Let’s begin with a close look at modern “AI” gadgets and what happens when security is not a top priority. A researcher bought the IKKO Activebuds, which are earbuds claiming to use ChatGPT. After opening them up, they found these are actually Android devices with a small screen and basic apps. The audio quality was poor unless you adjusted settings yourself. The most worrying part was software security: the earbuds had Android Debug Bridge (ADB) turned on by default, letting anyone connect from a PC. The researcher installed the old game DOOM on the earbuds, which made people laugh, but the real problems were much more serious.

The device stored OpenAI API keys right on the earbuds, only lightly hidden. The companion app let anyone with a device ID see chat histories and even full names, with almost no security checks. You could even make a fake QR code to link devices, and send messages to other users. Some protection stopped code injection, but it was still shockingly open for a product costing over 200 euros.

After these issues were reported, IKKO took the app offline and said they fixed the login process, but many problems remained. Old API keys were not rotated, and some API endpoints still worked if you knew the right headers. IKKO later made a few more changes, but the overall security model stayed weak.

Hacker News commenters were both shocked and amused. Many said leaving ADB open is a beginner mistake, and storing API keys on the device is always a risk. Some joked about running DOOM on every new device, but most were worried about privacy and the risk of leaking user data. There were questions about possible privacy law violations, and some users wondered if companies are simply rushing cheap Android hardware to market and calling it “AI.” The community praised the researcher for reporting the bugs, but wanted to see more companies take security seriously, especially for devices that handle personal data.

Next, let’s switch to something fun and simple—a website that shows the current phase of the moon using only ASCII art. That means the moon is drawn with text characters like #, %, and @, right in your web browser. The site updates in real time and works on both desktop and mobile, with no images or fancy scripts. The author was inspired by old terminal programs and wanted to bring back a retro way to check the moon’s phase.

People on Hacker News liked the nostalgia and the fast, minimal design. Some remembered similar tools from old computers or BBS systems. A few suggested adding features like showing moonrise and moonset times or a calendar view, but others warned that too many features could ruin the charm. There were also questions about the accuracy of the moon phase, and ideas for making the ASCII art even more detailed or adding color. Most users agreed this project is a good example of how simple ideas can still be creative and fun, and that ASCII art is a great way to make things fast and accessible.

Now, let’s talk about web accessibility. One article explained why you should never use “click here” as your link text. Instead, links should tell people what they will find if they follow them. For example, instead of “To download Amaya, click here,” you should say “Amaya” and put the link on that text. This is important for people using screen readers, because hearing a list of “click here, click here, click here” is confusing—they don’t know where each link goes.

Hacker News users mostly agreed. Many shared stories about how bad link text makes the web harder to use for people with disabilities, and also makes sites less friendly for search engines. Some said older websites still use “click here” out of habit, but most want to change to better practices now. A few noted that marketers sometimes prefer “click here,” but the community agreed that clear, descriptive link text is best for everyone and is an easy way to improve web usability.

Moving to science, a new study says there may have been a cosmic airburst in Louisiana about 12,800 years ago. Scientists found a strange lake with a raised rim, and in the soil, they found melted glass, tiny spherules, and shocked quartz—things usually linked to space impacts. The debris dates to the same time as the Younger Dryas Boundary, a sudden cold event in Earth’s history.

The team used many tests and found that the chemistry and features of the materials matched those from known impact sites, not normal Earth processes. They also ruled out other causes like volcanoes, lightning, or human activity. Models showed that a small comet or asteroid exploding just above the ground could explain the crater and debris.

Hacker News commenters were excited but careful. Some wondered if this proves the Younger Dryas impact theory, while others pointed out that more evidence is needed. There were discussions about the dating methods, possible other causes, and the risks of similar airbursts today. Overall, people liked the detailed science, but want to see more studies before calling it a confirmed impact site.

Let’s talk about web design. A new tool called Glass3D lets you create glass-like effects for your website using modern CSS. You can adjust blur, brightness, color, and texture, and see the changes live before copying the code. The tool uses the backdrop-filter property and CSS variables, and is easy to use—just add a class to your element. There is no JavaScript, and the code works in most modern browsers.

People liked the simple design and how fast it is to get good results. Some pointed out that not all browsers support backdrop-filter, and a few worried about accessibility, especially making sure text is still easy to read. Others suggested adding more textures, color presets, or export options for frameworks like React or Vue. Most users found it useful and fun, and shared their own CSS glass effects for comparison.

Now, a personal story of quiet and reflection. An article compared Quaker worship and Zen Buddhism, showing how both use silence and meditation to bring peace and understanding. The writer grew up Quaker and later added Zen practice to help with depression. They found that both traditions help let go of ego, focus on kindness, and bring mindfulness into daily life. Quaker meetings can be hard for newcomers because there is little instruction, but with practice, silent worship becomes more meaningful.

Hacker News readers liked the honest sharing and the idea that different traditions can learn from each other. Some noted that Quakerism is more about social action, while Zen aims for personal awakening. Others discussed how silence and direct experience are valuable in both. There were questions about mixing practices, but most agreed that mindfulness in daily life is important, not just during meditation.

Switching to software, another article reviewed caching libraries in Go. It explained the difference between on-heap and off-heap caches, and looked at how libraries like Ristretto, Theine, Otter, and Sturdyc have changed over time. Early Go caches were simple but slow. Ristretto brought new ideas but had bugs and was not perfect for all workloads. Theine improved speed and hit rate, but used more memory. Otter v1 was fast and used little memory, but missed some features. Sturdyc added loading and refreshing but was slower. Otter v2 tried to combine the best ideas, with high speed, high hit rates, and a flexible API, but it’s still new.

Hacker News users liked seeing ideas from Java’s Caffeine come to Go, and discussed which cache fits which workload. Some want simple APIs, others want advanced features. There were debates about using off-heap caches in Go, and people liked that Otter v2 learns from past mistakes. Most are waiting to see how it works in larger projects.

Now, some hopeful medical news. A new gene therapy has helped ten people in China with a rare hearing loss problem called OTOF mutation. Doctors used a virus to carry a working gene into the inner ear. Most patients heard better after one month, and all improved after six months. Younger children did best, but even adults improved, and there were no serious side effects.

This is the first test of this gene therapy in both children and adults. Scientists hope to try it for other deafness genes in the future. Hacker News users were excited, with some sharing personal stories and others asking about safety, cost, and the chance to help more people. Most agreed this is a big step forward and were hopeful for the future.

Finally, we have a story about art and code. The author of librdx, a complex but minimal software library, compares building software to the art of M.C. Escher. Escher’s pictures often show things looping and building on themselves, just like how software tools can be used to build themselves. Librdx is a data format, key-value store, and more, all in one. The writer says that good naming, clear rules, and focusing on a few key ideas help keep software simple and clean, even as it grows.

Hacker News users liked the connection between Escher’s art and software. Some talked about recursion, bootstrapping, and how building tools with themselves feels both strange and powerful. There were debates about using C for simplicity, and jokes about Escher’s endless stairs being like debugging code. Many enjoyed thinking about how art, math, and software connect.

That’s all for today. Thank you for listening to the Hacker News Daily Podcast. We hope you learned something new and enjoyed these stories from the world of technology, science, and software. See you next time!
