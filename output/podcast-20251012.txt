Hello everyone, this is the 2025-10-12 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we bring you stories about open hardware VPNs, new project threads, Edge AI for beginners, Emacs and AI, tricky bugs in programming languages, retro computing, formal verification, creative 3D scanning, bird photography, and better ways to understand code performance.

We start with an open-source hardware WireGuard VPN project using a low-cost Artix7 FPGA board. The team wants to make fast, secure VPNs more accessible by moving WireGuard from slow software to affordable hardware, and by using open tools so anyone can check or improve the code. WireGuard is already popular for its simplicity and security, but software versions are much slower than the network, and existing hardware is expensive or closed-source. This project builds on lessons from a previous high-speed switch called Blackwire, but now uses cheaper hardware and only open-source tools.

The development follows clear steps: first getting the board running with small tests, then building the WireGuard logic in hardware, and later adding management features. The design uses a soft CPU for control, while the heavy crypto work runs in custom hardware for speed. The project uses trusted algorithms like ChaCha20, Poly1305, Curve25519, and BLAKE2. Most crypto will run in hardware, but some parts, like key exchange, may start in software. Testing is important, with simulation tools and future plans for remote labs to get more people involved. Everything is documented to help new contributors and allow for open review. The project is still in early stages and aims to be practical and easy to manage in the future.

On Hacker News, many are excited about the open hardware and toolchain, seeing it as a step toward trustworthy VPNs. People like that the board is cheap, making it great for schools and hobbyists. Some worry about the complexity of FPGAs and the difficulty of debugging hardware, and there are questions about how easy it will be for others to copy the setup. Some ask if this approach can help in areas where VPNs are blocked, or how it compares to ASICs or CPUs with crypto support. Many praise the team for being transparent and hope open hardware becomes normal for network security.

Next, we look at the monthly “What are you working on?” thread. This is where developers, makers, and fans share their projects and ideas. People talk about new apps, tools for daily life, learning websites, games, open-source libraries, and even business startups. Some focus on solving work problems like managing servers or email, while others build smart devices or sensors. Links and demos are shared, and people ask for feedback or advice on growing users or making money. There’s a lot of talk about using new tech like AI or blockchain. Some just build for fun or learning, not profit.

Comments are full of helpful feedback, new ideas, and support. Users warn about overbuilding features and remind makers to talk to users early. There’s talk about balancing building with marketing, and many enjoy seeing what others create. The mood is positive and people learn from each other.

Now to learning AI on edge devices. Microsoft has released a free course on GitHub for Edge AI, teaching beginners how to run AI on local devices instead of the cloud. This supports privacy, speed, and lower cost. The course explains Edge AI basics, how small language models work, and how to optimize them for devices like phones, PCs, or IoT boards. There are hands-on guides for projects like chatbots and document search, plus lessons on scaling and compliance for real-world jobs. The course includes workshops, code, and supports many languages, letting you go from beginner to advanced skills.

On Hacker News, readers like the beginner-friendly style and focus on privacy. Some want more examples for hardware like Raspberry Pi or Android phones, while others wish for more real-world stories or video lessons. People agree that model optimization is important for small devices. Some point out that edge AI is still limited compared to cloud AI, but others say it’s important for privacy rules. There are tips about setup and praise for the hands-on projects. Overall, most agree this course can help more people start with Edge AI.

Let’s move to a new Emacs package called agent-shell, which lets you use AI agents in Emacs using the Agent Client Protocol. Agent-shell works like a native Emacs shell. You can chat with different AI models, such as Gemini or Claude Code, by just changing the setup. It uses comint-mode, so Emacs users will find it familiar. The author built extra tools for debugging, and even added a replay mode to test without paying for API calls.

The tool is open source and the author asks for feedback and support. Some features are missing and the author wants to improve user experience. In the comments, people are excited about using AI in Emacs and like that agent-shell lets you choose your AI. Some share ideas for more features, while others ask about privacy and setup complexity. There’s talk about the cost of AI APIs, and the replay tool is seen as helpful. Some suggest easier installation, and others wonder if more editors will support the Agent Client Protocol. Most praise the clear docs and look forward to more features.

Next, there’s a story about a hidden bug in the Kotlin compiler that only showed up for Turkish users. The problem was with how computers handle upper and lower case letters. In Turkish, the letter ‘I’ and ‘i’ have special rules that are not the same as English. Kotlin’s code changed case without saying which language’s rules to use, so words like “INFO” became “ınfo” (with a dotless ‘ı’) on Turkish systems, causing errors. Later, as Kotlin added more features, the bug caused even stranger failures, like wrong function names.

Turkish developers reported the bug many times, but it was hard to spot, as it depended on the computer’s language settings. The fix was to always use English rules for case changes in the compiler. In the comments, people say this shows why you should not use locale-sensitive string functions in programming tools. Others share stories about similar bugs, and praise the Turkish developers for not giving up. Some joke that the “Turkish I” is a famous problem. There’s talk about how complex Unicode is, and how open source lets users help find and fix these rare but deep bugs.

Now to retro computing: someone made a new BASIC interpreter for the 1983 Mattel ECS, an add-on for the old Intellivision game system. The author finished adding string support, garbage collection, and more math functions. They had to solve tricky memory problems, like strings filling up the stack and crashing the interpreter. The fix was to use two separate stacks and a simple marker value for garbage collection.

They also added graphics, cassette tape saving and loading, and printer support. Testing with real games helped find more bugs. The project took over 7,000 lines of assembly code in a month, and the code is open on GitHub.

Commenters are impressed by the dedication and technical tricks used. Some remember using BASIC and enjoy seeing old systems brought back to life. There’s talk about the string garbage collection and ideas for making it better. Some users are curious about cassette and printer support, while others praise the clear explanations and say they want to try the interpreter themselves.

Switching to formal verification, there’s an article about how even “proven” code can have bugs. The example is the famous leftpad function. Formal verification only proves code matches a specification, but if the spec is wrong or incomplete, the code can still fail. Bugs can come from wrong proofs, bad specs, or wrong assumptions about the system or input. The article gives examples, like binary search proofs failing due to number overflow.

In the comments, people share stories of verified code failing in the real world. Many say that most bugs come from weak specs, not the proof tools. There’s talk about how hard it is to write good specs, and that formal methods are best used with testing and code review. Some worry that people trust “proven” code too much. Others hope that tools will get better, but agree it’s important to know what was actually proven.

Next, we look at a creative way to make 3D models of insects using “Macro Splats.” The author takes many sharp photos from different angles, using focus stacking to solve problems with blurry close-up photos. A script helps rotate the insect and move the camera for each focus step. The setup uses a Nikon camera, a special lens, and takes over 1,700 images in four hours.

The images are processed to remove backgrounds and build a detailed 3D model, which is shared online for free. In the comments, people are amazed by the quality and discuss the technical challenges. Some suggest new hardware or ways to make the process faster. Others talk about educational uses and praise the author for sharing the models for free.

Now, a quick look at the Bird Photographer of the Year contest. Liron Gertsman won with a photo of a Magnificent frigatebird flying in front of a total solar eclipse. The shot took a year of planning and a week of scouting in Mexico. The contest had over 33,000 entries and supports bird protection. Other winners include photos of Alpine choughs in snow, petrels, barn owls, and swallows.

Comments praise the effort and patience needed for such photos. Some share their own stories of bird photography, while others like that the contest supports conservation. There are questions about editing rules and a wish for more behind-the-scenes details. Some praise the young photographers, and a few wonder if AI photos might be a problem in future contests.

Finally, we have a story about understanding code performance with dataflow graphs. Instead of profiling after code is written, the author shows how to model code by drawing instructions and their dependencies. This helps predict performance and find bottlenecks early. Examples include looping over arrays and linked lists, showing how data dependencies affect speed. The article discusses loop unrolling and how real CPUs add more complexity, but the main idea is that thinking in dataflow helps write faster, more predictable code.

In the comments, readers praise the clear examples and diagrams. Some point out that actual profiling is still needed, but agree that this method helps understand what really blocks code speed. There’s talk about using dataflow graphs for large systems and even for project planning. Most agree that learning to think about dataflow and critical paths makes you a better programmer.
