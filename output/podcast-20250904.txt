Hello everyone, this is the 2025-09-04 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have stories about Stripe’s new blockchain for payments, the results of the 49th ICPC World Finals, a project to save classic Mac patterns, a simple guide to nano-gpt, a new WiFi heart monitor, updates to Le Chat AI, the story of Action! on Atari, and Melvyn Bragg stepping down from “In Our Time.”

Let’s start with Stripe. Stripe has launched a new blockchain called Tempo, built just for making payments with stablecoins. Unlike other blockchains that are made for trading or many different tasks, Tempo focuses on fast, cheap, and reliable payments between people and businesses. Stripe worked with big partners like Visa, OpenAI, Shopify, and Deutsche Bank to make sure Tempo fits real business needs.

Tempo can handle more than 100,000 transactions per second, with results almost right away. Fees are very low, always the same, and you can pay them with any stablecoin. Tempo also has special privacy features, so payment details can stay secret but still follow the rules. It’s made for many uses: sending money across borders, paying people around the world, using payments in other apps, tiny payments, bot-to-bot payments, and instant bank transfers.

Some technical points include: paying fees in any stablecoin, special lanes for payments, easy swapping between stablecoins, sending many payments at once, and tools for rules and payment details. It works well with Ethereum apps, too. Tempo is open for anyone to use and build on, but right now, only partners can try it. Later, anyone will be able to run validator nodes.

On Hacker News, people are excited to see Stripe working on real payments with blockchain, something crypto promised for years. They like the big partners, but some worry about how decentralized Tempo will be, since big companies are running it at first. Others say payments are already fast in many places and wonder if Tempo really solves a big problem. Some ask if regular people will use it, or if it’s just for companies. There are also debates about privacy, and whether Stripe will see too much. Most agree that legal and regulatory rules are the hardest part of moving money, not the technology. People are watching to see if Stripe can make real progress.

Next, the 49th ICPC World Finals took place in Baku in 2025. University teams from around the world competed to solve hard programming and algorithm problems. St. Petersburg State University won first place, solving 11 out of 13 problems with a time score of 1478. The University of Tokyo and Beijing Jiaotong University also did very well, each solving 10 problems. The top teams were from Russia, Japan, and China, but many other countries made the top 50, like the US, Korea, Germany, Croatia, and Singapore.

Problems were labeled from A to L, and teams got better scores for solving more problems and for finishing faster. Many teams solved between 6 and 9 problems, showing how tough the contest was. Only one team solved 11 problems. Even top schools like MIT, Harvard, and Tsinghua were behind the winner.

In the comments, people are impressed by the skills of the Russian and Chinese teams, and say their training is very strong. Some wish there was more diversity among the top teams. Others point out that just making it to the finals is a big achievement. A few people say the contest problems are getting more mathematical each year and debate if that’s good for learning programming. Some share how ICPC helped them learn teamwork or get jobs. There are also comments about the contest format, with one computer per team, which tests communication skills. Many are happy to see new regions making it to the finals and hope this continues.

Moving on, there’s an article about saving the old black-and-white 8×8-pixel patterns from classic Macintosh computers. The author wanted to use these patterns in a project and found it hard to get clean, original images. There are 38 patterns, first seen in 1984, and the author used a Mac emulator and some tools to extract the raw pattern data from System 6. They then wrote a Python script to convert the data into .pbm files, which are easy to use for images of any size.

The reason for doing this is nostalgia, and to keep the patterns as close to the originals as possible. The author shares the patterns online for others to use. In the comments, many people feel nostalgic and remember how these patterns made early Macs feel personal. Some talk about how black-and-white screens needed clever designs to show textures. Others share tips on using emulators and ask about using these patterns in modern apps. A few discuss the value of the .pbm format for teaching graphics. Some wish more old resources were easy to find, and thank the author for preserving a small part of computer history.

Now, let’s talk about a simple guide to nano-gpt, a small language model. This model takes a string of six letters, like “C B A B B C,” and sorts them alphabetically. Each letter is a token—A, B, or C—and is turned into a number. The model turns each token into an embedding, a group of numbers, and sends these through transformer layers. At every step, the model tries to guess the next letter, and you can keep feeding the answers back to sort the whole string.

Hacker News readers liked how the article explains a hard topic in simple steps, with clear visuals and examples. Some note that real language models are much bigger, but starting small helps people learn the basics. There’s talk about how embeddings work, and some wish for more on how the model trains. Many say this is a good article to share with friends who want to learn about AI.

Next, researchers at UC Santa Cruz have made Pulse-Fi, a system that measures your heart rate using WiFi signals, with no device on your body. Pulse-Fi uses normal, cheap WiFi hardware and a machine learning algorithm. It sends WiFi signals, which bounce off everything in a room, including people. The system looks for tiny changes in the signals caused by your heartbeat and filters out other noise.

They tested Pulse-Fi with 118 people in many positions, even up to 10 feet away, and found it was very accurate. The hardware is cheap—just ESP32 chips or Raspberry Pis. The team collected their own data, using an oximeter and WiFi at the same time, to train the system. They are now working on measuring breathing rate too.

In the comments, people are amazed but also worried about privacy, since WiFi is everywhere and could now “see” inside your body. Some are excited about the low cost and use for hospitals or elderly care. A few ask about health risks, but others say it uses normal WiFi strength. Some wonder about false alarms or pets, but believe machine learning can help. Many agree that if privacy is handled well, Pulse-Fi could be very useful.

Let’s look at Le Chat, an AI chat tool from Mistral AI. It now has more than 20 connectors to business tools like Databricks, Snowflake, GitHub, Asana, and Stripe. You can search data, summarize, and take actions from the chat. If your tool isn’t listed, you can add your own connector. Le Chat works on your phone, browser, or your own servers, giving you full control.

A new “Memories” feature lets Le Chat remember things from your past chats, so it can give better answers and remember preferences. You control what is saved or deleted, and privacy is a big focus. All features, including connectors and memories, are free to use.

Admins can control access to connectors, and Le Chat can work with any MCP server. There are also webinars and a hackathon for users to learn more or build custom connectors.

In the comments, people are happy about the free connectors and say it could help teams work faster. Some worry about privacy, especially with AI remembering things. A few want to know how hard it is to set up custom connectors. Some compare Le Chat to ChatGPT and Copilot, saying it’s more flexible for business. The ability to run on your own servers is seen as a big plus. Some are excited about the hackathon and want to try building connectors.

Next is the story of Action!, a programming language for Atari 8-bit computers in the 1980s. Action! was created by Clinton Parker and sold as a cartridge with a text editor, compiler, and debugger—all in one, like a modern IDE. The editor had features like scrolling, copy-paste, and split screens, which were rare back then.

The language was simple, with only three data types, and looked like C or Pascal. You ended blocks with FI or OD, short for IF and DO spelled backward. The compiler was very fast, much quicker than BASIC or Atari Pascal. But there were limits: you needed the cartridge to run programs, and floating-point math was very basic.

Most users were hobbyists, with few commercial programs made in Action!. The manual was helpful but expected you already knew programming. Today, digital copies and tutorials are easy to find online for use with emulators or real hardware.

In the comments, many people remember Action! fondly. Some say it was the first time they felt like “real” programmers. Others liked the editor’s advanced features. Some wish it was available for other computers. There are debates about its power compared to C or Pascal, and tips for using it today. Some remember how expensive the cartridge was, but are glad resources are now free. Many agree that, for hobbyists, Action! was one of the best languages for Atari.

Finally, Melvyn Bragg is stepping down as the presenter of BBC Radio 4’s “In Our Time,” after more than 1,000 episodes since 1998. Melvyn’s work covered topics from science and history to art and culture, always making hard ideas easy to understand. He started at the BBC in 1961, worked on many top shows, and wrote several books. He has won many awards, including a Peerage and Companion of Honour. He will still work with Radio 4 on new projects, and his best episodes will be replayed this year.

Many people in the comments thanked Melvyn for making learning fun and friendly. Some worry the show might change with a new host, but hope Melvyn’s style will continue. Others shared favorite episodes or said the huge archive is like a free university for everyone. Most agree that Melvyn’s time as host was special and will be remembered for a long time.

That’s all for today’s episode. Thank you for listening to Hacker News Daily Podcast. See you next time.
