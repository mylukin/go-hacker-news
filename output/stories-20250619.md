- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44295725)

The article talks about "virtual cells," which are digital models of living cells used in research and medicine. This idea started back in 1952 with the Hodgkin-Huxley model, which showed how nerves work using math. For a long time, computers were too slow to model whole cells, but things changed in the late 1990s. Japanese scientists created E-Cell, a very basic digital cell, which was a big step forward even though it didn’t work perfectly. 

In 2012, scientists made a digital version of Mycoplasma genitalium, a very simple bacterium, and used it to test what happens when they remove certain genes. This helped uncover errors in real biological data, showing that virtual cells can teach us about real ones. By 2016, J. Craig Venter's team created JCVI-syn3.0, a synthetic organism with just 473 genes, and then modeled it digitally. By 2021, they could simulate the entire life cycle of these simple organisms in great detail.

Virtual cells have also been used to model more complex organisms like E. coli, showing how small changes in one cell can affect entire populations. By 2022, the FDA started using digital heart cell models in drug testing. With advances in AI, by 2024, virtual cells could be made even faster and smarter, helping in drug discovery and cancer treatment.

In the comment section, a user mentions the University of Connecticut’s work on cell models, which use complex math like ODEs and PDEs. They note that while high-throughput data has improved models, they still struggle with making accurate predictions. The commenter believes that the future might lie in combining these models with AI to make them more robust.

- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44321672)

The article talks about a new way to make large language models (LLMs) run faster. Researchers developed a tool called the Mirage Persistent Kernel (MPK) that turns LLM operations into a single, large GPU task, called a "megakernel." This approach reduces delays by combining all the steps needed to run a model into one task, rather than many smaller ones. This design is especially useful for tasks that need to use multiple GPUs at once. It means less waiting around for each step to finish before starting the next one, which is a big deal for fast computing.

The MPK system works by creating a detailed plan, or "task graph," for how the model's operations are handled. This graph allows the computer to do multiple tasks at once, using a mix of workers and schedulers to keep everything running smoothly. The scheduler assigns tasks, and the workers carry them out, ensuring that everything overlaps as much as possible to save time.

In the comments, people were excited about the potential of MPK. Some noted that it might make GPU use more efficient and wondered if it could be included as an experimental feature in popular tools like PyTorch. Others compared MPK to similar projects, like Stanford's manual CUDA implementation, and highlighted MPK's automated approach. There was also a discussion about whether these kinds of improvements could help with training models, not just running them, and how MPK might handle dynamic tasks like mixture-of-experts models. Some thought it was challenging but possible, while others doubted its usefulness for training.

Overall, the response was positive, with many commenters seeing MPK as a promising step forward in making LLMs faster and more efficient, especially for complex tasks using multiple GPUs.
