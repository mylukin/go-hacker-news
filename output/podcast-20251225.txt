Hello everyone, this is the 2025-12-25 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we bring you a mix of fast Python, digital archives, GPU tools, clever Git tricks, small business stories, important security news, DIY projects, and a hopeful step in Alzheimer’s research.

First, let’s talk about a big change for Python on Windows. Python 3.15 is planning to make its interpreter about 15% faster on Windows x86-64 computers. This speedup comes from using a new “tail-calling interpreter” instead of the old “switch-case” or “computed goto” methods. The old approach had a giant function with many cases, and the computed goto method, used on Linux and macOS, helped a little but not much on modern hardware. The tail-calling method splits each step into a small function that calls the next one, but it only works if the C compiler always does tail calls. Thanks to a new feature in Microsoft Visual Studio 2026, Python can now use this method safely. Tests show an average 15% speedup and up to 40% for some scripts. This is because smaller functions help the compiler optimize better. It’s best for small, pure-Python scripts, but helps big projects too. Right now, you need to build Python from source with special settings, but in the future, it will be easy for everyone. The article thanks the MSVC team and the contributors for their work.

In the comments, many readers are excited about the speedup. Some ask if Linux or macOS will also see gains, while others wonder about debugging and stack traces. A few warn about using experimental compiler features. Some share stories about interpreter design and compiler trouble, agreeing that giant functions are hard for compilers. Others wonder if this could help other languages. Some are glad Python is trying new ideas, while a few say real speed will depend on your code. Most agree this is a big win for Python on Windows and look forward to trying it.

Next, The New Yorker has put all its old magazines online, from 1925 to today. The digital archive lets you browse stories, cartoons, and covers from any year. You can search for famous writers or important events. The website shows original magazine pages, making it feel like reading the real thing. Some articles are free, but you need a subscription to see everything. The New Yorker hopes the archive will help students, writers, and anyone curious about history. There are guides for special topics and a strong search tool. Digitizing the pages took years of scanning and fixing images. They worked hard to make the text easy to read.

Commenters are excited to read old favorites or find things they missed. Many say it’s great for learning about history and culture. Some worry that the subscription will keep people out. Others point out that old magazines can be slow to load or hard to search, but most agree this is a big step forward. A few hope more magazines will do the same. Some are impressed by the technical work and others warn about copyright, but most see it as a win for readers and researchers. There are also jokes about getting lost for hours in the archive.

Now, some news for GPU developers. NVIDIA has open-sourced CUDA Tile, a new tool to help make CUDA programs faster by using tile-based computation. CUDA Tile is built on MLIR, a compiler framework, and helps you write and optimize code for NVIDIA GPUs, especially for tensor core tasks. CUDA Tile gives you a special way to describe tiled work, a Python API, and a way to save and load programs in a fast format. It comes with tests to check everything works as expected.

To use CUDA Tile, you need CMake, a C++17 compiler, Python 3.6 or newer, and some MLIR/LLVM tools. You can let it build these for you or use your own. There are options for Python features and build speed. Tests run using the LLVM system. You can add CUDA Tile to your project with pre-built libraries or by building from source. The article gives an example: write a small CUDA Tile program in MLIR, compile it to bytecode, then a GPU binary, and run it to process data on a GPU.

At the moment, NVIDIA is not accepting outside code changes, but you can report bugs or give feedback. The project uses the Apache License v2.0 with LLVM exceptions.

In the comments, many people are happy to see NVIDIA open more tools. Some are excited about the MLIR design, saying it helps build new compilers. A few think this will help machine learning code run faster. Others are not so sure, pointing out that not accepting code changes limits the “open source” part. Some wish it worked on more hardware, not just NVIDIA GPUs. There are tips for setting up build tools, and some praise the Python API for quick testing. People hope NVIDIA will allow community code in the future. Some say this is for advanced users, but it’s a good sign for open GPU development.

Next, a clever Git trick. This article explains how to archive old Git branches by turning them into tags. The idea is to keep your Git history clean. Old branches can fill up your list and get hard to manage. By turning them into tags, you keep a record but don’t see them in your active branch list. The writer shares a Git alias called “archive-branch.” It creates a tag named “archive/branchname” and deletes the branch. The tag keeps the branch’s state, but your branch list is shorter. The alias uses some Bash magic so you can use tab to autocomplete branch names, like with “git switch.” To make this work, you need the official Git completion scripts, and on macOS with Zsh, you must set up the right files.

This idea came from a Reddit thread about best ways to archive branches.

In the comments, some readers like the trick and say it’s a clean way to keep history. Others warn that deleting branches, even if tagged, might confuse people who want to work on them later. A few say that tags and branches are different in Git and you should not mix them up. Some share their own scripts or ways to handle old branches. One reader says tags make it harder to see which branches are still active, helping teams stay focused. Another asks about remote branches, and someone explains you need to delete remote branches by hand. Overall, most say it’s a clever use of Git, but be sure to tell your team what you’re doing.

Now a story about a small business that started with a domain name. A man bought VidaliaOnions.com at an auction, just because he liked buying domain names. Later, he thought about selling onions online, like how people order fruit. He had no farming or shipping experience, but reached out to the Vidalia Onion committee and met a farmer named Aries Haygood. They guessed they might sell 50 orders the first season but got over 600. The man ran the website and marketing, and the farmer handled growing and packing. They did so well that other farms stopped selling onions by mail and sent customers to them. He tried many ways to advertise, like a billboard and sponsoring events, and even added a phone order option. Not everything worked—he once lost $10,000 on bad shipping boxes, but kept going because customers loved the service. They called him “The Vidalia Man.” He says the business is more about purpose than profit and is happy helping people get onions they love.

Commenters found the story inspiring. Many liked hearing about a simple business started by someone outside the industry. Some enjoyed the focus on action and the power of a good domain name. A few shared their own stories of niche web projects. Some were surprised how much people love Vidalia onions. Others asked how to handle shipping problems and avoid big mistakes. Some worried about the risk of depending on one product. Most said you don’t need new technology to build something meaningful, and the story made them think about starting their own small projects.

Next, we have important security news. A critical bug was found in LangChain Core, a popular AI framework. The bug, CVE-2025-68664, lets attackers steal secrets or run bad code if not fixed. The problem was in how LangChain handles special data. There is a key called “lc” to mark special objects. The functions dumps() and dumpd() did not check if user data also had “lc,” so attackers could make data look trusted. This vulnerability is very serious because LangChain Core is used everywhere. Just one prompt could trigger the bug. It affected event streaming, logging, message history, and caches.

Attackers could steal secret keys, like AWS keys, and sometimes run their own code. The problem was made worse because secret extraction was on by default until the fix. The issue was not bad code, just a missing security check.

A researcher found the bug by checking where untrusted data gets saved and loaded. The LangChain team quickly fixed the issue and made defaults safer. The researcher got a $4,000 bounty, the highest for this project.

Technical details: “lc” helps LangChain know which objects are special, but if user data isn’t checked, it can be confused for internal objects. Some classes can make network calls or do other actions when created, which attackers could use. There was also risk with Jinja2 templates, which can run code if misused.

Everyone using LangChain should update to the latest version. Treat all AI outputs as untrusted, especially if you save and reload them. Turn off secret handling unless you know the data is safe.

Commenters praised the write-up and quick response. Many were surprised that such a basic mistake could slip through. Some compared this to old Java or PHP deserialization bugs, saying you should always be careful with object loading. Others worry AI frameworks are moving too fast and not paying enough attention to security. Some say this is a sign that organizations need better control over their AI systems. There were also comments about the size of the bounty. Many users shared tips for security, like always upgrading and never trusting user input. Some called for better defaults in popular frameworks, and a few pointed out that this bug could happen in other languages and tools, so the whole industry should be careful.

Now, a fun DIY project. This article shows how to make spinning sculptures from empty soda cans that move using heat from a lamp. The writer calls them “can spinners,” like candle carousels seen at Christmas. You cut shapes from cans, make a small dent in the middle, and balance them on a sharp wire over a lamp. As the lamp heats up, warm air rises and makes the spinner turn. The article explains each step—sharpening the wire, cutting the can, making the dimple, shaping the blades, and balancing the spinner. Thin can sides are easy to cut but wear out after spinning for weeks. Thicker can bottoms last longer. Even LED bulbs work, but not as well as old bulbs. The writer shares pictures of different shapes, like turbines and windmills. Some spin better than others, and he learned by trying new designs.

People in the comments liked the simple and fun idea. Some said it reminded them of old decorations or science toys. A few were impressed that you can use recycled cans and basic tools. Others talked about safety, mentioning sharp edges and the risk if the spinner falls on a hot bulb. Some suggested ways to make the spinner last longer, like using a harder wire or a tiny bead for the pivot. A few wanted to see a video. One asked if this works with sunlight. Another joked about making giant spinners. Some liked the creativity and said they would try it with their kids. Others talked about the physics of heat rising. Overall, the comments were positive and showed lots of interest in simple hands-on projects.

Finally, some hopeful news in Alzheimer’s research. A new study says Alzheimer’s disease can be reversed in mice, not just slowed or stopped. The team, led by Case Western Reserve University, found that fixing the brain’s energy balance, especially the molecule NAD+, helped sick mice recover fully. Alzheimer’s has always been seen as a disease that can’t be cured, only slowed. The scientists used mice with human gene mutations that cause Alzheimer’s. In both mice and human brains with the disease, NAD+ levels drop very low. Without NAD+, brain cells can’t work and start to die.

The team used a drug called P7C3-A20 to restore NAD+ balance. They gave the drug both before and after the mice got sick. In both cases, the drug stopped or even reversed the damage. Mice that had lost brain function got better, and their brains healed. Blood tests showed that a marker for Alzheimer’s, called phosphorylated tau 217, returned to normal.

The team says this gives hope that people could recover from Alzheimer’s, not just slow it down. But they warn that over-the-counter NAD+ boosters can be dangerous and may cause cancer if NAD+ goes too high. Their drug works by keeping NAD+ at a safe level. They hope to test this in people soon and see if it can help with other brain diseases. They say this is a message of hope, because maybe even a damaged brain can heal.

Hacker News commenters had mixed feelings. Some called the study a breakthrough, others were careful, pointing out that many things that work in mice do not help people. Some want to see human trials before getting too hopeful. A few worried about safety with NAD+ boosters. There were comments about how hard it is to treat Alzheimer’s, and many past cures have failed in humans. Some were glad the study did not promote risky supplements. Others asked how the drug works and if it can help with other diseases. There was discussion about how hard it is to get new drugs approved, but many agreed this is an important step and hope for more good news in the future.
