Hello everyone, this is the 2025-11-09 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have a packed show covering creative hardware projects, new tech laws, classic programming resources, and more. Let’s get started.

First, let’s talk about a fascinating 3D printing project. The author built a complex 3D-printed marble fountain using procedural generation and custom code. Inspired by high-end 3D printers, they wanted to create a marble run art piece with many moving parts. The journey started by placing random points for the marble tracks, connecting them with smooth curves and keeping a steady slope. They soon realized that just cutting tubes was too simple. So, they wrote a path solver to fill the printer’s space with as much track as possible. This was not easy—getting smooth, reliable paths that marbles could follow took many attempts.

The code had to keep the tracks inside the box, spread out evenly, maintain a constant slope, and avoid sharp turns. Tracks also needed to keep away from themselves and each other, so marbles would not crash. Speed control was another big challenge: if straight sections were too long, marbles would fly off; if turns were too tight, marbles would stop. The solution was to make the track snake back and forth, using banked turns to slow marbles down safely.

The marble lift was designed like a ball screw, held in place by the marbles themselves, but this caused wobbling problems if marbles pushed only on one side. To support the tracks, a simple particle system was used. Supports pulled together but also pushed apart to keep good spacing, forming smooth arcs thanks to simulated inertia. A lot of time was spent making the supports look nice, not just strong.

Exporting the final 3D models was slow and hard for OpenSCAD to handle. The author thinks a better tool would help next time. They also want features like marble speed tracking and movement prediction. The project took longer than planned, running from February to September, and was rushed for an art show. The fountain could only run for a few hours before overheating, and it still lost a few marbles each hour. After the show, the author took a break for a year before finally sharing the code and story.

In the comments, readers praised the creativity and technical skill. Many were happy to see procedural design used in physical art, not just games. Some wanted more details about the path solver and hoped for code examples or visual demos. Others shared their own marble run stories, agreeing that speed control is hard. People suggested other tools like Blender or SDF libraries for better organic shapes. There was talk about making things strong enough for public display, and using sensors to track marbles. Some shared 3D printing troubles with overhangs and complex shapes. One commenter said sharing even “janky” code helps others learn. Overall, the feedback was positive and encouraged more sharing.

Next, let’s look at a new law in Montana. Montana passed the Right to Compute Act, making it the first state in the US to give people a legal right to use computers and AI tools. This law protects owning and using hardware, software, and AI like basic rights such as free speech or property. People in Montana now have control over their digital tools. The law allows the state to set safety rules if needed, but only with strong reasons and care.

For important systems like power grids, the law says humans must be able to shut things down, and safety checks have to happen every year. Supporters say this law is a big step for digital freedom, especially as AI spreads. Groups for privacy and digital rights praised the law, and some other states, like New Hampshire, are thinking about similar laws. Some even say using computers is a basic human right because computers help people think and create.

Hacker News readers mostly welcomed the law. Some hope it will stop big tech and governments from blocking what people can do with their own devices. Others worry the law is too broad or might not have much effect unless people know about it. Some question if it will hold up in court or clash with federal laws. There’s talk about digital rights being important as tech becomes a bigger part of life. Many agree this is an interesting and important move from Montana.

Now, let’s check in with the monthly open thread, where Hacker News users share their current projects. This thread is always lively. Makers, developers, and indie hackers talk about SaaS apps, open-source tools, websites, hardware devices, games, and AI ideas. Some are launching new features, others celebrate getting their first users, and a few are just learning or building for fun.

People share their struggles—finding time, getting feedback, marketing, or growing a user base. Some ask for advice or offer to test products. Many share tips on tools, libraries, and marketing. Staying motivated is a big topic, with some saying building what you care about is better than chasing trends. There are friendly offers to connect or help out. Many users say these threads are inspiring, even for small projects.

Next, a video project shows someone powering his house using battery cells from 500 thrown-away vape pens. He collects used vapes, removes the small lithium batteries, tests each one, and uses 3D-printed holders to arrange them safely. Connecting all the cells, he builds a battery pack with about 2.5 kilowatt-hours, wired to an inverter for AC power. He can run his workshop and power things like a kettle using this recycled battery bank. The project shows that disposable vape batteries are still good after use, and highlights the waste problem.

Commenters were amazed by the project and praised the smart use of 3D-printed parts. Some gave safety advice, warning about risks with lithium batteries and the need for proper switches. Others joked about finding these batteries everywhere, and were shocked by how good these “waste” batteries are. A pro engineer suggested using higher voltage for better safety. There were jokes and wild ideas, but also worries about whether vape shops really recycle batteries. Many agreed this project shows the value of creative reuse.

Moving on, the next article is about the online archive of Edsger W. Dijkstra’s manuscripts. Dijkstra was a famous computer scientist known for his deep work in algorithms and theory. The online archive collects over a thousand of his technical notes, letters, and reports—called “EWDs” after his initials. He wrote these for over forty years, mailing them to colleagues. Many important ideas started as EWD notes.

The site offers PDFs, indexes, some transcriptions, and translations, though new translations are not accepted now. The original papers are kept at the University of Texas at Austin. There are summaries, interviews, recordings, and links to related projects. The copyright belongs mostly to Dijkstra’s children.

In the comments, people say Dijkstra’s writings are deep and still useful, especially for learning clear thinking. Some find his style hard but rewarding. Others love having a window into his thought process. A few share their favorite EWDs or memories about how reading these notes changed their careers. There are suggestions for more scientists to share their notes, and praise for the volunteers making the archive easier to use. Some discuss Dijkstra’s strong opinions, but most agree the archive is a great gift to the programming world.

Next, let’s turn to an article that explains diffusion models in machine learning. Diffusion models are now popular for generating images, sounds, and more from noise. The basic idea is simple: start with real data, slowly add noise, then train a model to reverse the process, step by step. There are three main ways to understand these models—the variational view, score-based view, and flow-based view. All use a changing “velocity” over time to move from noise to data, solving a kind of math equation.

The article also discusses ways to guide the model, make it faster, and jump between steps. In the comments, many say the article is a clear and helpful summary, especially for beginners. Some like having different views to help understand the math. There are debates about which view is best for research or teaching. A few say the math is still hard, and others hope for more simple examples or pictures. Some share links to code and demos. There’s also talk about whether diffusion models will replace GANs, but most agree both have strengths. Overall, readers find it a good starting point.

Now, let’s look at a DIY handheld computer project, the Bumble Berry Pi. The creator wanted something like the Clockwork Pi uConsole, but cheaper and faster. The design uses a 4.3-inch touchscreen, a mini Bluetooth keyboard, and a big battery. Only two 3D-printed parts are needed for the case. All the parts are easy to buy online, and the total cost is about $60, not counting the Raspberry Pi. The project works with older Pi models, so you can reuse old hardware.

To build it, you print the case, add threaded inserts, fit the Pi and screen, and put in the keyboard and power bank. Cables are connected, and the case is closed with screws. Files and instructions are on GitHub, and the builder is open to feedback and requests for more details.

Hacker News commenters liked the simplicity and the reuse of old Pi boards. Some suggested design improvements, like more ports or a bigger screen. There were worries about typing comfort on the small keyboard, but most thought the trade-off was worth it. Some wanted more assembly videos for beginners. Overall, people said it’s a fun project for learning and personal use.

Next, we have a piece on the Pennsylvania Computer & Technology Museum, also called The Computer Church. This museum has one of the world’s largest collections of analog computers—over 50 rare machines like the ISEC250, DONNER 3500, EAI TR-48, and the RangeKeeper Mark 7, which was used on a US Navy ship at Pearl Harbor. These analog computers were vital in the 1940s and 1950s for military and science work, solving math problems with gears and wires before digital computers took over.

The museum also covers early personal computing, with items like the Homebrew Computer Club Newsletter and Bill Gates’s “Open Letter to Hobbyists.” There are even rare joke items like the “Kitchen Computer” from a Nieman Marcus catalog.

In the comments, people praised the collection and shared their memories with similar machines. Some wish more museums would show off analog computers and teach how they work. Others spoke about the value of early newsletters for the tech world. There were even jokes about old tech marketing. Many agree that keeping these machines alive is important for tech history.

Let’s move to a retro topic—the Sega Master System. The article compares this 1980s game console to the Nintendo NES and Sega’s earlier SG-1000. It explains how consoles are grouped into “generations,” but these lines are often blurry. The Master System came after the SG-1000, sharing some hardware, but was released at the same time as the Famicom in Japan. Sega waited before going worldwide, so the Master System ended up competing with the NES.

The article details the hardware—more RAM, more colors, and simpler split-screen effects than the NES. Sega’s hardware was strong and reliable, while Nintendo’s was more open to creative tricks. The author shares their own experiences making simple programs for the Master System and plans to build more complex games.

Commenters noted the Master System was technically better in some ways, but less popular in some countries because Nintendo had more games and better marketing. Some shared stories of playing the Master System in Europe and Brazil, where it stayed popular longer. There were tips for programming on these old systems, and nostalgia for both the hardware and the games. Some wish modern hardware was as open and easy to hack as these old consoles.

Finally, we have a project about building a CHIP-8 system from scratch. CHIP-8 is a small virtual machine from the 1970s, used for simple games and learning computer basics. The author made an emulator in C, an assembler in C++, a flappy bird clone in CHIP-8 assembly, and even a hardware version using VHDL on an FPGA board.

The emulator handles CHIP-8’s small registers, stack, timers, keypad, and simple graphics. The assembler turns human-readable code into machine code. The game uses tricks like self-modifying code to handle sprite heights. The hardware uses a clock divider, display drivers, and a simple state machine. Drawing is basic but works.

In the comments, people said CHIP-8 is a great way to learn about emulators and hardware. Some shared their own projects, and others asked about making things faster or cleaner. There were questions about self-modifying code and multi-pass assemblers. Many praised the clear explanations and open-source code. Overall, readers found the project inspiring and helpful for anyone interested in low-level programming.
