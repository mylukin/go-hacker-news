## Spotting base64 encoded JSON, certificates, and private keys

- 原文链接: [Spotting base64 encoded JSON, certificates, and private keys](https://ergaster.org/til/base64-encoded-json/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44802886)

This article is about how to spot if a string is base64 encoded JSON, a certificate, or a private key just by looking at the first few letters. The writer found a suspicious string in an encrypted file and wondered what it was.

The string looked like random letters, but a colleague guessed it was base64 encoded JSON because it started with "ey". Decoding it proved this was true—the string was actually a JSON object with keys like "salt" and "iterations". The trick is that base64 encoding of '{"' (the start of a JSON object) always begins with "ey". For example, encoding '{"s' gives "eyJz", and encoding '{"a' gives "eyJh". This means you can sometimes spot base64 encoded JSON just by seeing if it starts with "ey".

The article also explains that certificates and private keys, which begin with "-----BEGIN" in PEM format, are base64 encoded as strings starting with "LS". For example, encoding "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----" gives "LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBDRVJUSUZJQ0FURS0tLS0t". This pattern helps you quickly spot encoded keys or certificates.

But the article warns this is not a perfect method. If a YAML file starts with "---", its base64 encoding will also start with "LS", so you can get false positives. It’s a handy trick, but not 100% reliable.

In the comments, some people thought this trick is fun and useful for quick checks, especially when poking around strange files. Others pointed out that you need to be careful—just seeing "ey" or "LS" at the start doesn't guarantee the content is JSON or a certificate. Some explained how base64 encoding always produces the same output for the same input, so these patterns are consistent.

A few users said this is a neat way to recognize data in logs or configuration files, but stressed you should still decode and check before making decisions. Someone mentioned that in security, you shouldn’t trust just the look of data—always verify it. Others were surprised they never noticed these patterns before and plan to use the trick in their daily work.

Some commenters worried that this could make it easier for attackers to spot secrets in files, so using strong encryption and not exposing keys is still important. One person noted that this pattern also appears in API tokens or JWTs, which are often base64 encoded JSON. Overall, many found the tip clever but reminded everyone to use it carefully and not as a security tool.

- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44802414)

Ollama Turbo is a new paid service that lets users run large AI models much faster using special hardware in data centers. The main idea is that many new AI models are too big or slow for normal home computers, but with Turbo, people can use bigger, faster models without buying expensive hardware.

Turbo costs $20 per month. It speeds up model inference, so answers come back quickly. You can run larger AI models, which need more memory and power. The service helps keep your own computer fast and saves its battery, because the heavy work happens on Ollama’s servers instead. Privacy is important—Ollama says it does not keep your data or log your requests. Right now, two models, `gpt-oss-20b` and `gpt-oss-120b`, are available. Turbo works with the Ollama App, command line tool, API, and programming libraries for JavaScript and Python. The hardware for Turbo is in the US. There are some limits to how much you can use it each hour and day, but in the future, they plan to offer pay-as-you-go billing.

Hacker News users had a lot to say. Some were excited about being able to use large models easily without setting up their own servers. Others liked that privacy is a big focus—no logs or saved data. A few people wondered about the cost, saying $20 per month can be high if you don’t use it often, so they liked the idea of upcoming usage-based pricing. Some users asked about which models would be included in the future and hoped for even larger or more open models. There was interest in using Turbo for both personal and business projects, especially with the API and libraries. A few people had questions about data security and wanted to know more about what happens if there are bugs or outages. Some worried about the US-only data centers and hoped for more locations worldwide. Others discussed how Turbo compares to running your own GPU at home, noting that this service is likely easier and more power efficient. Finally, several users were happy that Ollama made running powerful AI models more accessible to everyone, not just people with expensive computers.

## Consider using Zstandard and/or LZ4 instead of Deflate

- 原文链接: [Consider using Zstandard and/or LZ4 instead of Deflate](https://github.com/w3c/png/issues/39)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44801027)

This article talks about using new compression methods, like Zstandard (ZSTD) and LZ4, for PNG image files instead of the old Deflate method. The main idea is that these new codecs can make reading and writing PNG files much faster, which is important for people who work with lots of images.

The author says that Zstandard is already used in some modern tech, like GPU textures, and it is open source and free from patent problems. LZ4 is also very fast for compression and decompression. The article mentions that there are even simpler and faster methods, like QOI, but using them would need more changes to how PNG files are handled. The author suggests making these new codecs an option for a future version of PNG, not replacing the old one right away. Adding these options could help users who need speed, especially in data processing or when working with many images at once. They also point out that browsers and software would need updates to support these changes.

In the comments, some people agree that Zstandard and LZ4 are good choices because they are fast, open, and already in use in other places. One person says Brotli, another modern codec, is also popular and used in web fonts. Some note that using a new compression method would make PNG files incompatible with old software, so it might need a new name like “PNG2.” There are also comments about needing good benchmarks and real-world tests to see if the speed increase is worth the change. Some say that unless big companies start using these new formats, it might not be worth the trouble. Others point out that memory use and compression ratios are also important, not just speed. A few suggest designing PNG so it can support new codecs in the future, making it flexible. Finally, some warn that splitting the format could confuse users and developers, and that any move should be done with care.

- 原文链接: [Claude Opus 4.1](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-1)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44800185)

Claude Opus 4.1 is a new upgrade to Anthropic’s large language model, focused on helping with coding, agent tasks, and more advanced reasoning. This model is now available for paid users, through the API, and on platforms like Amazon Bedrock and Google Cloud.

Claude Opus 4.1 has improved coding skills, scoring 74.5% on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark. This is better than the previous Opus 4 model, especially for research, data analysis, and keeping track of details. Companies like GitHub say Claude 4.1 is much better at handling big code changes, such as fixing code across many files. Rakuten Group tested it and found it’s good at making only the right changes in large code projects, avoiding extra edits or mistakes. Windsurf, another company, says the model’s performance is like a jump in skill from a junior to a more experienced developer.

The article suggests all users should upgrade to Opus 4.1. Developers can use the new model with a simple change in their API calls. There are links to more information about the model, pricing, and detailed technical docs. Benchmarks were done using standard ways, sometimes with “extended thinking” (where the model is prompted to reason more before answering), depending on the test. For coding tests, the model uses tools like bash and file editing, but not the planning tool from older versions.

In the Hacker News comments, some users are excited about the new improvements and higher coding scores. A few compare this to OpenAI’s latest GPT models, asking if Claude is now better for certain programming tasks. Others mention the importance of transparency in benchmarks, wanting to know exactly how tests were run. Some developers are happy about the simple upgrade process, while a few worry that constant updates may make it hard to keep up or test everything thoroughly. Several users discuss the use of “extended thinking” in benchmarks, debating if this reflects real-world coding. There are also questions about pricing and if the results are worth the extra cost for small teams. Some comment on the trend of AI models improving fast, but wonder how much these changes really help everyday developers. Finally, a few people share their own experiences with Claude, with some saying it’s now their favorite tool for debugging, and others still loyal to other models like GPT-4.

## The mystery of Winston Churchill's dead platypus was unsolved until now

- 原文链接: [The mystery of Winston Churchill's dead platypus was unsolved until now](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cglzl1ez283o)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44776505)

This article tells the story of a platypus sent from Australia to Winston Churchill in 1943 during World War Two. The animal, named Winston, was a diplomatic gift, but it died just before reaching England, and the cause of death was a mystery for many years.

Australia wanted to impress Churchill and get more support in the war. Even though platypuses were hard to transport and rarely survived long trips, they captured one and built a special tank for him on the ship. The crew fed him worms and cared for him during the 45-day journey by sea. When Winston died, stories spread that he was killed by explosions from a German submarine. But the real reason was unknown for decades.

Recently, researchers in Australia and the UK searched old records. They found logs from the ship’s crew and the man who cared for Winston. The logs showed there were no explosions or chaos on board. Instead, the records showed that the platypus’s food was running out, and the water and air temperatures were rising above 27°C—the safe limit for platypuses. Scientists now say that Winston likely died from the heat as the ship crossed the equator, not from shock or bombing.

Later, Australia tried platypus diplomacy again by sending three platypuses to the Bronx Zoo in the US. This trip was public, but only two of the animals survived for a while, and their story became a media circus. In the end, platypus diplomacy failed, and Australia stopped sending the animals abroad.

Hacker News users found the story fascinating and amusing. Some said it showed how little people knew about animal care in the past. Others thought the story about blaming a German submarine was a way to save face, and liked how history can be shaped by who tells it. A few commenters discussed how hard it is to keep platypuses alive outside Australia, and how their special needs are often ignored. Some people joked about the idea of “platypus diplomacy” and wondered what other strange diplomatic gifts have been tried. Others reflected on the strange things leaders focus on during times of crisis. Many users enjoyed the detective work done by the modern researchers and liked seeing an old mystery finally solved. Some wished that animals were not used in politics at all, while others just enjoyed the quirky details of history.

## What's wrong with the JSON gem API?

- 原文链接: [What's wrong with the JSON gem API?](https://byroot.github.io/ruby/json/2025/08/02/whats-wrong-with-the-json-gem-api.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44804043)

This article talks about problems with the JSON gem API in Ruby. The author became the gem’s maintainer not for speed, but to fix confusing and dangerous parts of the API.

First, the article explains that handling deprecations (removing or changing old features) is hard for users, but often needed for safety and better design. Ruby now helps by letting you see deprecation warnings in tests, which is important for catching problems early.

A big issue is the `create_additions` option. When true (the default in `JSON.load`), it lets JSON data tell Ruby to create objects of any class with a special method. This can be risky. It makes it easy to have security bugs if you use untrusted data, and even safe code can become unsafe if another library adds a method you didn’t expect. Because of this, the author deprecated this default and wants users to choose it on purpose, or switch to a new, safer way using a custom callback.

Another problem is how JSON handles duplicate keys in objects. The old default was to keep the last one, but this is not clearly written in the JSON rules. Silent acceptance of duplicates can hide bugs or even cause security problems. Now, the gem warns about duplicates and will raise errors in the future unless you allow them.

The `to_json` and `to_s` methods also cause trouble. Any object can define how it turns into JSON, but this is a global change—it affects the whole app, not just your part. Worse, if Ruby doesn’t know how to handle an object, it just calls `to_s`, which often gives a useless string and can break things. The author made a new API, `JSON::Coder`, so you can control how objects are turned into JSON in one small part of your program, not everywhere.

The article also warns about global default options like `JSON.dump_default_options`. Changing these can affect every library in your app, sometimes in surprising ways, similar to monkey-patching. The new `JSON::Coder` lets you set options locally, which is safer and clearer.

The author says that removing features is always a trade-off, but some old APIs are so risky or confusing that it’s worth the trouble to change them, especially if they are not much used.

In the comments, some users agree that the old API is unsafe and thank the author for these changes. Others say breaking old code is always painful, even if it’s for safety. Some people remember security problems from similar features in other languages, like YAML in Ruby or Python, and like the move to make dangerous options explicit. A few users think global settings are fine for small scripts but become a problem in big apps and libraries. Some say the JSON spec itself is too vague, which causes these problems. There is debate about whether warnings should become errors by default—some want stricter checking, others worry about breaking working code. A few people share stories where silent duplicate keys or global changes caused real bugs that were hard to find. There’s also discussion about how best to balance ease of use and safety, and some wonder if Ruby’s culture of global changes is part of the problem. Overall, most agree that local, explicit control is better for complex projects, even if it makes the API a bit harder to learn.
