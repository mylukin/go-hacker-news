- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43799396)

The article talks about speeding up the `./configure` process in software builds. This process checks if certain components exist on a system before compiling code. The author, Tavian Barnes, is frustrated that even in 2025, `./configure` uses only a fraction of one CPU core, making it a slow step in building software. 

Tavian suggests that the `./configure` process could be made faster by running checks in parallel. This is because many of these checks are independent of each other. The article provides examples of how to use Makefiles to parallelize these tasks. By using Makefiles, the author explains how to generate makefile fragments that check for compiler flags, and then merge these fragments into a main Makefile. This allows for multiple checks to run at the same time, using more CPU cores efficiently.

The author provides scripts and examples of how to implement this in practice. For instance, a script called `flags.sh` checks compiler flags and writes supported ones into makefile fragments. Another script, `define.sh`, helps in creating a `config.h` file that defines macros based on the presence of features in the system. These steps are wrapped up in a shell script to mimic the familiar `./configure` command.

In the comments, some users agree with Tavian's frustration and find the solution clever. They appreciate the use of parallelization to speed up the configuration process. Others point out that while this approach is smart, it might not work for all projects because of dependencies between checks. Some users also mention that similar concepts have been discussed before but haven't been widely adopted, possibly due to the complexity of changing existing systems. Overall, the discussion highlights a shared desire for faster build processes and the potential of parallelization as a solution.
