## Concurrency in Haskell: Fast, Simple, Correct

- 原文链接: [Concurrency in Haskell: Fast, Simple, Correct](https://bitbashing.io/haskell-concurrency.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43679906)

The article "Concurrency in Haskell: Fast, Simple, Correct" explores the author's journey from working with languages like C, C++, and Rust to using Haskell, especially for real-time systems where performance can be critical. The focus is on how Haskell handles concurrency, offering a mix of threads and event-driven IO to efficiently use multiple cores and manage slow external systems like networking and disk IO.

In Haskell, concurrency can be achieved through threads created with `forkIO`, but for more control, the `async` package provides tools like `async`, `wait`, and `cancel`. Haskell uses green threads managed by its runtime, which leads to efficient performance. To manage data safely across threads, Haskell uses Software Transactional Memory (STM), allowing atomic operations on shared data structures. TVars, TBQueues, and the ability to compose STM actions into atomic transactions are key features. STM helps prevent common concurrency issues like deadlocks and race conditions without using traditional locks or mutexes.

In the Hacker News discussion, many users appreciate Haskell's STM for its elegance and power, noting how it simplifies complex concurrency problems. Some commenters point out that while other languages like Clojure and Scala have STM implementations, Haskell's is particularly robust due to its functional nature. Others discuss the challenges of using async models in different languages, with some finding Python's async difficult compared to Haskell's approach. There's debate on the performance of Haskell's immutable data structures, but many agree that Haskell's runtime and garbage collector handle these efficiently. Some users express interest in Haskell's ability to manage large numbers of concurrent requests, noting the stability and performance of its ecosystem. Overall, the discussion reflects varied experiences and insights into Haskell's unique approach to concurrency.

## Passing planes and other whoosh sounds

- 原文链接: [Passing planes and other whoosh sounds](https://www.windytan.com/2025/04/passing-planes-and-other-whoosh-sounds.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43713524)

The blog post by Oona Räisänen dives into the "whoosh" sound planes make when passing overhead. At first, you might think it’s just the Doppler effect, but Oona points out there's more to it. The sound doesn't just drop in pitch and keep going down—it goes back up after the plane passes. This isn’t how the Doppler effect works, so Oona explores further.

The mystery is partly solved by looking at a time-frequency spectrogram. It shows a pattern called "comb filtering." This happens when two versions of the same sound, arriving at different times, overlap and create an interference pattern. In the plane's case, the ground acts as a giant mirror, reflecting the sound back. This creates that unique whoosh. Oona also uses the "cepstrum" to dig deeper, showing how delays and echoes affect the sound we hear. The ground echo theory suggests the reflective surface of the ground causes a delay, making the sound seem to change in pitch.

In the comments on Hacker News, people shared different thoughts. Some wondered if the sound is affected by the plane's engines or flaps, while others talked about how sound reflects off different surfaces, like clouds. A few mentioned that the sound might change based on the listener's position or environmental conditions, like wind or temperature. Others shared personal experiences in places with minimal sound reflections, like deserts or anechoic chambers, and how that compares to the whoosh effect. There were also discussions about similar effects, like flanging in music and how interference patterns can change sound perception. Overall, the comments showed a mix of technical insights and personal anecdotes, making it clear that the whoosh sound is a fascinating blend of physics and human perception.

- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43711001)

The article tells the story of the Battle of Solferino, a major but now largely forgotten battle in 1859, which led to the creation of international humanitarian law. Henry Dunant, a Swiss businessman, witnessed the battle's aftermath and was deeply moved by the suffering he saw. This experience inspired him to establish the International Committee of the Red Cross and to push for the First Geneva Convention, which set rules for the humane treatment of wounded soldiers.

Dunant's efforts were driven by the chaos he saw at Solferino, where thousands of soldiers lay wounded or dying with no organized aid. He organized care for these men, showing that even in war, compassion is possible. Dunant's work laid the foundation for international agreements that sought to limit suffering in war. These agreements evolved into a broader system of international law, which, despite its flaws, has helped make the world more peaceful by promoting human rights and cooperation.

The Hacker News comments show a mix of views. Some users reflect on the horrific nature of war, noting that modern conflicts still show similar brutality. Others debate the effectiveness of international law, with some arguing it has helped reduce warfare, while others feel it's often ignored by powerful nations. There's also discussion about the role of military training and preparedness in society, with some advocating for basic military skills for all, and others questioning the necessity and health risks of such training. Some comments critique the notion of a "rules-based international order," arguing it's often used to justify actions by powerful countries. Despite differing views, many agree that Dunant's work has had a lasting impact, reminding us of the importance of striving for peace and justice.

## Adipose tissue retains an epigenetic memory of obesity after weight loss

- 原文链接: [Adipose tissue retains an epigenetic memory of obesity after weight loss](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08165-7)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43678138)

The article discusses how fat tissue (adipose tissue) remembers being obese even after losing weight. This "memory" can make it easier to regain weight and is linked to changes in genes, a process called epigenetic change. The study found that even after significant weight loss, the fat cells in both humans and mice kept some changes to their genes. This means that the body might not fully "forget" it was obese, which can affect how it holds onto fat in the future.

The research used advanced techniques like RNA sequencing to study these changes in both humans and mice. They looked at how different types of cells in fat tissue behave before and after weight loss. The study also notes that methods like bariatric surgery (a weight-loss surgery) can change the body's metabolism but might not fully reset this "memory."

In the Hacker News comments, users shared various insights. One user mentioned that fat cells shrink when you lose weight but don't disappear, which aligns with the study's findings. Others discussed how similar "memory" effects occur in muscle, making it easier to regain strength once you've built it before. The comments also touched on the use of steroids and testosterone, noting the long-term effects on the body. Some users debated the role of metabolism and how it impacts weight gain and loss. They argued about whether weight gain is due to a "slow metabolism" or other factors, with some suggesting that genetics or diet play a bigger role. There were also personal stories about weight loss struggles and how lifestyle changes, like diet and exercise, can help manage weight long-term.
