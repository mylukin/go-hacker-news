- 原文链接: [Metagenomics test saves woman's sight after mystery infection](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czx45vze0vyo)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43842367)

The article is about a 29-year-old doctor, Ellie Irwin, whose eyesight was saved by a metagenomics test after a mystery infection caused inflammation in her eye for five years. Traditional tests failed, leading to a misdiagnosis of an autoimmune condition. The metagenomics test, a last-resort option, identified a rare bacterial infection, leptospirosis, likely contracted during a swim in the Amazon River. This breakthrough allowed effective treatment with antibiotics, clearing up her condition.

The metagenomics test uses genomic sequencing to identify pathogens in a sample by comparing them to a vast database. This method can diagnose infections that other tests might miss. The high cost of around £1,300 per test could decrease as the technology advances, making it more accessible for everyday medical practice.

In the comments, some users express surprise that doctors didn't try broad-spectrum antibiotics earlier, given the chronic nature of the infection. Others argue that doctors might have avoided antibiotics to prevent resistance and because initial tests showed no infection. There's also discussion about the UK being more cautious with antibiotics than the US. Some users point out that metagenomics, though highlighted as a unique service in the UK, is being researched and used in other places. Additionally, commenters discuss the balance between individual patient care and broader societal concerns about antibiotic resistance. Despite varying opinions, many agree on the importance of better diagnostic tools like metagenomics.
