Hello everyone, this is the 2025-07-01 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have news about Figma planning to go public, a new study on street trees in Las Vegas, an update from the Roman Roads Research Association, a clever project for two-way code-and-GUI editing, ideas for deep space missions to Sedna, the shutdown of Fakespot, July’s tech job thread, a new AI-powered terminal browser, and a story about a custom Discord bot for friends.

First, Figma has filed to go public and aims to list its Class A stock on the New York Stock Exchange with the symbol “FIG.” The company’s papers with the U.S. SEC say the number of shares and price are not set yet. Figma will only go ahead if market conditions are good. Figma began in 2012 as a design tool and has grown into a platform for team collaboration in digital product building. It uses AI to make design and development easier and more fun for teams of all sizes. Big banks like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are helping with the IPO process. The company also made clear this is not an offer to sell shares yet, with more details to come later.

On Hacker News, many users praised Figma for changing how teams design together. Some worry that going public could harm the product, as happened with other apps after IPOs. There are concerns about higher prices or changes to free features. A few people note that Adobe once tried to buy Figma, and wonder if this IPO is a move to stay independent. Some ask if Figma can keep growing, or if the design tool market is now too crowded. Figma’s strong plugin system and community are seen as big advantages. Others discuss the risk that investors may push Figma to focus more on profits, which could change its culture. There’s also debate on how Figma compares with Sketch, Adobe XD, and others, with some developers sharing tips for using Figma beyond just design. Finally, there’s interest in the technical side—how Figma’s web-based system can handle so many users at once.

Next, a study looked at how planting more street trees in Las Vegas could help reduce heat, especially for people walking outside. Using computer models, the study tested different tree-planting plans and measured their effect on air temperature, humidity, and how hot it feels. Adding trees can lower air temperature, but most cooling happens at night. During the day, the main benefit is shade, which can reduce the heat people feel from the sun and hot surfaces by up to 16°C. The type of tree matters—trees that release more water cool better but need more water, which is a problem in a desert city. More trees also increase humidity, but this does not make the heat feel worse because of the extra shade. The biggest benefit is at night, helping people sleep better and reducing health risks.

In the comments, some pointed out that trees use a lot of water, while others said even a little shade makes a big difference. Picking the right tree species is important, as is planning for long-term care and growth. Some urban planners were interested in using these findings to design better streets. Others suggested using reflective surfaces or shade structures instead of trees. Many agreed that tree-lined streets are much nicer to walk on. Overall, people see street trees as one important way to make cities safer and more comfortable in hot places.

The Roman Roads Research Association, a group in England, is sharing knowledge about old Roman roads. They offer free and paid online lectures by experts on Roman roads, history, and archaeology, and invite people to join or send in photos. They publish a journal called Itinera, first for members but later free for all. The website will soon get an update to be easier to use. The group also hosts events like walks along Hadrian’s Wall for charity, and works with other groups to protect important road sites. They use modern tools like LiDAR to find new roads and share many lectures on YouTube. The group welcomes anyone who wants to help with articles, photos, or projects.

Hacker News users liked the open sharing of talks and research. Some shared their own interest in Roman roads and stories about finding them. Others discussed how LiDAR and other tech help discover new sites. Some users wanted a better website, and welcomed the news about an update. There was praise for the journal and for making it open access. Many wished for similar groups in their own countries and asked about joining or donating. Some were surprised by how much is still being discovered about Roman roads. Users also shared links to more Roman history resources. The comments showed strong support for open, community-led archaeology.

A new project lets you edit code and a GUI at the same time using the Language Server Protocol. The author wanted to work on CAD projects in their favorite code editor, but also make quick changes in a graphical interface. The main idea: if you move an object in the GUI, the code updates; if you change the code, the GUI updates too, in real time. The author built a proof-of-concept with a server that talks to the editor using LSP and to a web GUI with WebSockets. This lets both views stay in sync. The code is online for others to try. While not planning to continue the project, the author hopes others will use LSP for creative tools, and suggests OpenSCAD as a good place to test more ideas.

In the comments, many liked the idea, especially for design and CAD work. Some noted technical challenges, such as handling conflicts and keeping formatting and comments. There are worries about making it work for big or complex files. Some users already use file watchers for GUI reloads but say it’s not as smooth as real-time editing. Others suggest using LSP for music or data visualization tools. Some say built-in editors are “good enough,” but power users want more control. There is interest in bridging the gap between programmers and designers, and people hope more tools will try this idea in the future.

A study explored how to send a spacecraft to Sedna—a faraway object in our Solar System—using new engine types. Two main ideas are compared: a Direct Fusion Drive (DFD) rocket and a solar sail. The DFD uses nuclear fusion for steady power, letting the ship slow down and orbit Sedna. The solar sail, coated with a special material, gets a big push from the Sun’s heat and uses a gravity assist from Jupiter, but can only fly by Sedna, not stop. The DFD could reach Sedna in about 10 years, the solar sail in about 7 years—much faster than normal engines, which would take 30 years or more.

Commenters are excited about the numbers but point out that fusion engines are still not ready. Solar sails are simpler and proven, but hard to control far from the Sun. There’s debate about costs and risks, with some saying we need bold missions to learn more, and others worried about missing this chance if we wait. People suggest other engine ideas and discuss what science could be done at Sedna. Most agree it’s an exciting idea, but with big challenges ahead.

Fakespot, a tool for spotting fake product reviews, has shut down after nine years. Mozilla, which bought Fakespot in 2023, ended the service because it could not make it sustainable. Fakespot started in 2016 when its founder was tricked by fake Amazon reviews. It used AI to find patterns in reviews and worked across many shopping sites. Studies found up to half of Amazon’s top product reviews could be fake, and in some categories, almost 90%. Fakespot got millions in funding and was seen as an important tool for honest shopping. Mozilla added Fakespot to Firefox, but in May 2025, said it would close both Fakespot and Pocket to focus on Firefox and new AI features.

Many users are sad to see Fakespot go, saying it helped them shop safely. Others note that fake reviews are getting smarter, and it’s hard for any tool to keep up. Some say Fakespot sometimes made mistakes, and others understand the business reasons for shutting down. There are calls for Amazon and big sites to do more to fight fake reviews. Some hope new tools will appear, and the article’s author is already working on one called TrueStar to fill the gap. A few developers talk about making their own scripts to spot review spam, but all agree it’s a tough problem. Overall, people feel online shopping is now riskier without Fakespot.

The July 2025 Hacker News job thread is open, where companies and recruiters share job openings in tech. Most posts include company name, location, type of work, and skills needed. Many roles are for software engineers, web developers, data scientists, and designers. Jobs are in big cities and remote. Some list salaries and benefits. Startups share details about their team and culture, while larger companies list perks like health insurance. There are also contract jobs and internships. The thread is open to jobs anywhere in the world.

In the comments, people ask about visa support, remote policy, and discuss job market trends. Many see more remote roles, but note interviews are still hard to get. Some say salaries are lower now, while others see startups paying well for top talent. There is advice for job seekers, such as how to write a good resume and watch out for scams. Overall, the thread is seen as a helpful place for both hiring and job hunting.

Spegel is a new tool—a web browser for your terminal that uses AI to turn web pages into simple markdown text. The creator built it for fun, and it improved after Google launched a faster AI model. You can set up your own prompts to view sites as you like, such as asking for only steps and ingredients in a recipe. Spegel grabs a site’s HTML, sends it to an AI with your prompt, and shows the clean result in your terminal using the Textual library. Right now, it only supports GET requests, so you can’t use forms. It’s not meant to replace old browsers like Lynx, just to test out new ways to read the web in a terminal.

Many commenters like the idea of using AI to make the web simpler and less distracting. Some worry about privacy, since browsing data is sent to an AI model. Others point out that AI can make mistakes, so results may not always be accurate. There are ideas for more uses, like translating or simplifying text for learners. Some talk about technical details, like how markdown streaming could break on some sites. Others want features like login support or better accessibility. Many think it’s a creative use of AI and look forward to more updates.

Finally, we have a personal story about a Discord bot built to help a friend group stay connected. The friends had moved to different countries, and their group chat was too noisy for game invites. The author made a Python Discord bot that sends a notification when someone joins a voice channel, making it easier to see when friends are online and ready to chat or play. The bot keeps stats about who joins and when, which the group enjoys at their holiday parties. At first, not everyone liked the bot, but over time, even skeptics started to use it, and it became a new way for the group to stay close. Plans for the future include adding achievements and maybe making a hardware device to show who is online.

In the comments, many liked the idea and wanted to try it with their own friends. Some said similar bots exist, but this one’s custom stats made it special. A few worried about too many notifications in large groups. Others praised the personal touch and how it helped friends stay close, even when far apart. Some discussed technical improvements, and many agreed that small projects like this can have a big effect on social life.

That’s all for today’s episode. Thank you for listening to the Hacker News Daily Podcast. We’ll be back tomorrow with more news and stories from the world of technology.
