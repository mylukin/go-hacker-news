Arduino, now owned by Qualcomm, has changed its Terms of Service and Privacy Policy in a big way. These new rules move Arduino away from being open and friendly to users, and more toward being a closed, corporate platform.

The new terms give Arduino a permanent license to anything users upload. There is now strong monitoring of AI features, and users are not allowed to look for possible patent problems. Even if you delete your account, Arduino keeps your username for years. All user data, including data from children, is now shared into Qualcomm’s global system. The biggest change: users cannot reverse-engineer or try to figure out how Arduino works without special permission. This is very different from the old, open way that made Arduino popular with teachers, makers, and students. The article also mentions that some cloud systems were down recently, adding to problems. The author says that anyone who cares about open source, community, or privacy should read the new rules carefully. There are also worries about Qualcomm’s business actions, such as past fraud by an executive and spending on private jets.

In the comments, many people are upset and sad about these changes. Some say this will hurt academic and robotics research, which used Arduino because it was open. Others say goodbye to Arduino and plan to use other boards like the RP2040 or ESP32. A few people are not surprised, saying big companies often make things worse for the community. Some see this as a chance for new, open projects or companies to take Arduino’s place. There are questions about real alternatives now and which platforms will become popular instead. A few call out Qualcomm as not understanding the maker community and only caring about money. Still, some think the open-source spirit will continue, with or without Arduino, because there are many clones and similar projects. Many agree these new rules are a big mistake, and that the maker and hacker community will find ways to move forward.

A very big ship called Dali hit the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore after a blackout caused by a single loose wire. The crash made the bridge fall, which killed six workers who were fixing the road.

Investigators found that the loose wire in the ship’s electrical system made a breaker open by mistake, which led to two blackouts. This stopped the ship from steering or moving just as it came close to the bridge on March 26, 2024. The problem started because the wire was not fully pushed into its place, since a label band was in the way. When the ship lost power, the team tried to steer away from the bridge, but it was too late. The bridge collapsed, and parts of it fell onto the ship. At that time, seven road workers and one inspector were on the bridge; six died. Quick actions by the ship’s pilots and local workers stopped more cars from entering the bridge, which saved other lives.

The NTSB chairwoman said finding the loose wire was very hard because the ship has so many wires, but the crash could have been stopped if better checks were in place. The investigation also found that the bridge was not built strong enough to resist hits from big ships like Dali. Ships today are much bigger than in the past. In 1980, a much smaller ship hit the same bridge, but it only did a little damage. Now, the Dali is ten times bigger.

The NTSB had warned that many bridges are at risk from large ships, but many bridge owners did not know about the danger. After the crash, the NTSB told 30 bridge owners to check their bridges and make them safer if needed. The board also made many new safety suggestions to government groups, ship companies, and the maker of the electrical parts.

People on Hacker News had many ideas about this accident. Some thought it was shocking that one wire could cause so much trouble, saying it shows how even small mistakes matter in big systems. Others talked about how ships and bridges are not being updated for today’s bigger ships. Some commenters pointed out that bridge owners need better rules for checking risks. A few said ship wiring should be checked more often, and that old safety standards do not match today’s technology. There were also people who wondered why the bridge did not have better protection from ship crashes, and they shared ideas for stronger bridge designs. Some felt sad about the workers who died and asked if more training or faster alerts could help next time. Others said it is hard to plan for every risk, but big accidents like this show why we need strong safety steps. A few commenters praised the quick action of local workers who stopped traffic and saved lives. Some joked about the size of ships today, comparing them to skyscrapers lying on their side. Finally, many agreed that after this, more bridge checks and better ship safety rules are needed everywhere.

## Building more with GPT-5.1-Codex-Max

- 原文链接: [Building more with GPT-5.1-Codex-Max](https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-1-codex-max/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45982649)

OpenAI just released GPT-5.1-Codex-Max, a new AI model for coding tasks. It is faster, smarter, and uses fewer tokens than earlier versions, making it helpful for developers who want to build and fix software.

The article explains that GPT-5.1-Codex-Max can handle very long coding jobs, like big refactors or debugging that lasts many hours. It does this by using a special method called “compaction” to remember important details while forgetting less important parts, so it can work on huge projects without running into memory limits. The model is trained with real-world engineering tasks, including code reviews and pull requests. It now also works well on Windows, and helps more in the Codex command-line tool.

GPT-5.1-Codex-Max is more efficient—it can finish tasks with about 30% fewer tokens than before, saving time and money. There is also a new “extra high” reasoning mode for even better answers if you don’t mind waiting longer. Developers can use it in the CLI, IDE extension, or cloud, and soon through the API. The model can work alone for many hours and even fix its own mistakes.

Security is a key focus. Codex-Max works in a safe “sandbox,” with no outside network access unless you turn it on. OpenAI warns that, while Codex-Max is their best model for cybersecurity so far, it still does not reach the highest safety level, so they are adding more protections. They recommend developers always check the AI’s work before using it in real products.

Codex-Max is available now for ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Business, Edu, and Enterprise users, and will soon be in the API. It will replace the older Codex model as the default in Codex tools, and is best used for coding tasks, not general AI questions. OpenAI says that since using Codex, their own engineers are shipping 70% more pull requests.

In the Hacker News comments, some people are excited about the improvements, especially the long context and better token use. They think this will help with big, complicated projects. Others are worried about safety and letting AI change code for hours without humans watching. Some users discuss how “compaction” could sometimes remove important info, leading to mistakes, and wonder how well Codex-Max actually keeps track of complex projects.

A few developers share that they still want to review all AI changes themselves, since even smart models can make small errors. Some commenters hope the model will be available on more platforms soon. Others point out that better cybersecurity from AI is a double-edged sword—attackers might use it too, so OpenAI’s safety steps are important.

A few people ask about the cost of running long tasks and if savings are real for small teams. There is also some debate about how much this tool will change daily developer work, with some seeing it as a big boost and others thinking it will help most with boring or repetitive coding tasks. Overall, the community is interested but cautious, wanting to see real-world results.

## Researchers discover security vulnerability in WhatsApp

- 原文链接: [Researchers discover security vulnerability in WhatsApp](https://www.univie.ac.at/en/news/detail/forscherinnen-entdecken-grosse-sicherheitsluecke-in-whatsapp)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45985036)

Researchers found a big security problem in WhatsApp’s contact discovery system. This system helps users find friends by matching phone numbers, but the researchers showed it could be used to check more than 100 million phone numbers per hour and find out which numbers use WhatsApp.

The researchers tested this by sending many requests to WhatsApp’s servers. The server would answer if a number was linked to an account. By doing this quickly, they could map over 3.5 billion accounts in 245 countries. The data they got was only what anyone could see with a phone number—like public profile details, timestamps, keys, and sometimes the profile picture or “about” text. Still, they could learn things like which phone system (Android or iOS) people used, how old the account was, and how many devices were connected. The team also found that millions of people in countries where WhatsApp is banned (like China and Iran) still have active accounts. They noticed differences in privacy behavior, such as how often users share public profile pictures in different countries. Some technical issues were found too, like cryptographic keys being reused, which could mean unofficial or fake WhatsApp apps are in use. About half of the phone numbers from an old Facebook leak were still active on WhatsApp, showing long-term risks from leaked data. The study did not touch message contents, which remain encrypted and private.

Meta (WhatsApp’s owner) worked with the researchers, fixed the problem, and thanked them. They updated WhatsApp to block this kind of mass checking by adding limits and making profiles less visible to strangers. The researchers deleted all the data they collected. They believe it is important for outside experts to keep testing big apps for safety, even if the app is popular and trusted.

In the Hacker News comments, some users said this was an old and known problem with contact discovery in many apps, not just WhatsApp. Others pointed out that using phone numbers as user IDs is risky because phone numbers are not secret. People discussed how messaging apps trade privacy for convenience—if it is easy to find friends, it is also easy to find anyone else. Some were surprised how much public data can reveal, even if it seems harmless. A few were impressed by the researchers’ careful and ethical approach. Others felt Meta responded well, but some worried fixes might not be enough if attackers get creative. There were calls for more use of usernames instead of phone numbers. Some users worried about metadata, saying encryption doesn’t help if too much public info leaks. Others reminded that true privacy needs more than just technical fixes—it’s also about the design of the whole system.

## Meta Segment Anything Model 3

- 原文链接: [Meta Segment Anything Model 3](https://ai.meta.com/sam3/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45982073)

Meta’s new Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM 3) is a tool that can find and follow any object in pictures or videos, using both words and images as prompts. Soon, this tool will be part of Instagram’s Edits app and the Meta AI app to help people edit videos and pictures more easily.

SAM 3 lets you use simple text, like words or short phrases, to point out objects you want to find. You can also draw a box around an example, and SAM 3 will find all similar objects. If you click on an object, SAM 3 can select it, and it can also use positive or negative clicks to get better results. If it makes a mistake, you can give more hints to help it improve the selection. This new version works on both pictures and videos, so you can track objects as they move. The model is trained on lots of different images and videos, so it works well in many real-life situations. SAM 3 is better than the older versions, SAM 1 and SAM 2, because it can use text prompts and can segment and track objects more precisely. You can even download the model to try it yourself. Meta also mentions a new tool called SAM 3D, which can work with 3D objects.

In the Hacker News comments, many people are impressed with SAM 3’s ability to use text prompts, saying this is a big step forward for computer vision. Some users are excited about how easy it is to select and track objects just by describing them. Others mention that being able to use text or drawings to guide the model could help many people, even those who aren’t technical. A few commenters wonder about the speed and size of the model, especially for use on phones or slower computers. Some people are interested in using SAM 3 for projects outside photo editing, like in science or robotics. Others are a bit worried about privacy and how these tools might be used on social media. There are also comments about the quality of the open-source release, with some asking if all features are included. A few developers are excited to experiment with the model and share ideas for creative uses. Some mention that the model still needs human help for perfect results, but most agree it is a big improvement. Finally, there are questions about how this might change jobs that involve photo or video editing, with some saying it will make things much faster and easier.

## Static Web Hosting on the Intel N150: FreeBSD, SmartOS, NetBSD, OpenBSD and Linu

- 原文链接: [Static Web Hosting on the Intel N150: FreeBSD, SmartOS, NetBSD, OpenBSD and Linu](https://it-notes.dragas.net/2025/11/19/static-web-hosting-intel-n150-freebsd-smartos-netbsd-openbsd-linux/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45982162)

This article compares how different operating systems perform when hosting a static website with nginx on a small Intel N150 mini PC. The author tested FreeBSD, SmartOS, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Debian, and Alpine Linux using the same nginx setup, both over HTTP and HTTPS, to see if the OS choice really matters.

The test used the default nginx package and almost no tuning. The same static site and nginx configuration were used everywhere. For HTTP (no encryption), almost all systems—whether running directly on the hardware, in a jail, or in a SmartOS native zone—reached about 64,000 requests per second. The SmartOS LX zones (Debian and Alpine) were a bit slower, around 46,000–49,000 requests, but still fast. The main message: for serving static content over HTTP, the OS doesn't make much difference.

For HTTPS (with TLS), the results changed. FreeBSD, Debian, and Alpine Linux could all push about 63,000 requests per second, but FreeBSD did this while using much less CPU. Debian and Alpine used more CPU, but still had some headroom. SmartOS, NetBSD, and OpenBSD reached lower numbers—around 40,000–52,000 requests per second—and quickly hit 100% CPU usage. The differences seem to come from how each OS uses the CPU for cryptography, not nginx itself.

Isolation methods also matter a bit. FreeBSD jails and SmartOS native zones performed almost like bare metal. SmartOS LX zones were a bit slower, likely because they translate Linux calls for the illumos kernel. Still, the overhead was not huge.

The final takeaway is that for static HTTP, OS choice is not important on this hardware; for HTTPS, FreeBSD, Debian, and Alpine are better, with FreeBSD having the most CPU left for other jobs. But the author says real-life needs—like your team’s skills or favorite tools—are often more important than small benchmark differences.

In the comment section, many readers agreed that modern OSes are all good for static sites, especially over plain HTTP. Some pointed out that in real deployments, network speed, storage, or CDN use often matter more than server benchmarks. A few people were impressed by how well FreeBSD handles TLS, suggesting it's a strong choice for low-power hardware. Others debated the value of benchmarks, saying that tuning and real-world traffic often change results. Some users shared their own experiences, noting that security, familiarity, and update habits can be better reasons to pick an OS than tiny speed wins. There were also questions about the test setup, with some wishing for results on more powerful hardware or with different TLS settings. Overall, readers liked the practical approach and the reminder that choosing an OS is about more than just speed numbers.

## Pozsar's Bretton Woods III: Sometimes Money Can't Solve the Problem

- 原文链接: [Pozsar's Bretton Woods III: Sometimes Money Can't Solve the Problem](https://philippdubach.com/2025/10/25/pozsars-bretton-woods-iii-the-framework-1/2/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45984072)

This article is about Zoltan Pozsar’s idea called “Bretton Woods III,” which talks about big changes in the global money system after the West put sanctions on Russia in 2022. Pozsar says that when countries saw Russian dollar reserves get frozen, they started to rethink if holding U.S. dollars was safe.

Pozsar explains that there are two types of money: “inside money,” like bank deposits and government bonds, which are promises by institutions, and “outside money,” like gold or oil, which has value by itself. He shows that the first global system (Bretton Woods I) was backed by gold, then after 1971 (Bretton Woods II), by U.S. Treasuries. Now, after the sanctions, countries worry their dollar assets could be frozen, so they want more outside money to protect themselves.

Pozsar builds on Perry Mehrling’s “money view,” which says money has four “prices”: par (can you always get cash for your deposit?), interest (cost of borrowing), exchange rate (value vs. other money), and price level (what stuff costs). Central banks can control the first three, but not the price of things like oil or wheat. Pozsar says, “You can print money, but not oil or wheat.”

He also connects these four prices to the real world: exchanging money is like moving cargo, interest is like shipping time, stability is like protecting shipping routes. When actual shipping or commodity trade is disrupted, central banks can’t fix it with just money.

The article gives an example: After sanctions, Russian oil that went quickly to Europe now needs to travel much farther to Asia, using more ships and more time. This means banks must lend more money for longer periods to commodity traders. If banks are also being asked to hold more safe assets (because of rules) and the central bank is pulling money out of the system, it gets even harder to lend, causing stress in markets.

Pozsar also points out that non-U.S. banks hold huge amounts of dollar assets but don’t have the Federal Reserve as a safety net. When there’s a shortage of dollars, these banks can get into trouble, which can create big problems for the global financial system.

In the Hacker News comments, some people agree with Pozsar and say the freezing of Russian reserves made countries lose trust in the U.S. dollar, pushing them to buy more gold and other commodities. Others think the dollar will stay important because there isn’t a good replacement—U.S. financial markets are still the deepest and most trusted. A few users point out that shifting to commodities like gold is hard because they are less flexible to use in global trade than digital money.

Some readers worry that more focus on “outside money” could make global trade slower and more expensive. Other commenters add that controlling actual goods (like oil or wheat) means countries will care more about supply chains and security, not just finance. There’s also debate about whether central banks really can’t control commodity prices—some say they can influence them through interest rates and policy, just not perfectly.

One commenter notes that non-U.S. banks’ dependence on dollar funding is risky and could cause problems if there’s another crisis. Another says Pozsar’s idea helps explain why we’re seeing more countries make trade deals in their own currencies, but that this trend is slow. Some users are skeptical, saying predictions of the dollar’s decline have been made for decades without coming true. Finally, a few appreciate Pozsar’s focus on the “plumbing” of finance, saying it shows how real-world logistics matter as much as money itself.

## Detection, Decoding of "Power Track" Predictive Signaling in Equity Market Data

- 原文链接: [Detection, Decoding of "Power Track" Predictive Signaling in Equity Market Data](https://github.com/TheGameStopsNow/power-tracks-research)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45984789)

This article explains a way to find secret signals, called “Power Tracks,” in stock market trading data. The authors say these signals are small, fast bursts in the data that can predict where a stock’s price will go in the future.

They started by looking at trade data for GameStop (GME) from many sources, including both public exchanges and hidden markets called dark pools. They built a system that watches for sudden, strange bursts of trading activity, using math tools to spot patterns that do not look random. When a burst is found, they collect all the tiny trades in that moment and turn the data into a stream of numbers. These numbers are then decoded using techniques like XOR masks, varint, and zigzag encoding—ways to hide and pack data efficiently.

The system tries to turn the burst into a prediction, like a range of prices the stock might reach over the next few minutes, hours, or even days. The authors give real examples where their decoded signals matched what the stock price actually did, sometimes predicting big moves before they happened. They tested their method on more than a hundred bursts and found that over 80% of the predictions were correct, which is much higher than random guessing. Sometimes, several Power Tracks would overlap, creating a more complex forecast for the price.

They believe these signals are made by advanced trading computers, possibly to share plans between groups or to quietly control the market. The encoding is clever and hides the signals from normal detection. The authors say this could be a form of market manipulation, giving unfair advantages to those who can read the signals. They suggest that regulators should look for Power Tracks to keep markets fair.

In the comment section, some readers were very impressed by the technical work and the possible discovery of hidden communication in the market. Others were more skeptical, saying that the findings could be just overfitting or seeing patterns in random data (pareidolia). A few users pointed out that high-frequency trading is full of strange bursts, and not all of them are secret messages—some are just side effects of trading algorithms fighting each other.

Several commenters asked for the code and data so they could try to repeat the results themselves. Some said the decoding process seemed complicated and maybe too easy to get wrong, especially with so many choices about how to interpret the numbers. Others worried about the legal side: if people really are signaling in this way, it could be illegal, or at least against the spirit of fair trading.

There was also discussion about whether similar signals might exist in other stocks, or even in crypto markets. Some liked the idea that if these signals can be detected in real-time, it could help traders or watchdogs react faster. But a few users warned that if everyone tried to use the signals, they might disappear or the people sending them would change their methods.

Overall, the comments showed both excitement and caution. Many wanted to see more proof, while others thought the idea of secret, coded signals in the stock market was both fascinating and a little scary.

## Launch HN: Mosaic (YC W25) – Agentic Video Editing

- 原文链接: [Launch HN: Mosaic (YC W25) – Agentic Video Editing](https://mosaic.so)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45980760)

Mosaic is a new AI tool that helps people edit videos more easily. The company says their platform uses “agentic” AI, which means it can make smart decisions to help with video editing.

The main idea is to let users describe what they want, and the AI will edit the video for them. For example, you could ask it to cut boring parts, make the video shorter, or focus on certain people or objects. The platform tries to save time for creators, especially those who aren’t experts in video editing. Mosaic can also add effects, transitions, and even generate suggestions for what might make the video better.

The founders explain that traditional video editing is hard and takes a lot of time. Many people want to make videos for social media or work, but they don’t have the skills or patience to learn big editing programs. Mosaic tries to solve this problem by using AI “agents” that act like helpers. These agents can understand instructions, analyze video content, and perform tasks step by step.

The platform is cloud-based, so users don’t need to install anything. Everything happens in the browser. Mosaic also focuses on privacy and says they don’t share user videos with third parties. Early users can sign up to try the beta version.

In the Hacker News comments, some people are excited about Mosaic. They say it could help people who are not video experts make better content. Others think this kind of tool is perfect for creators who want to work faster and spend less time editing.

Some users wonder how smart the AI really is. They ask if it can handle complex edits or just simple tasks. A few worry about the tool taking away creative control from users. They say that editing is an art, and AI might make everything look the same.

Others point out that AI tools often struggle with understanding context—like knowing what is important in a video. Some commenters think Mosaic has potential but want to see real-world examples before they get too excited. People also mention that similar tools exist, and they are curious about what makes Mosaic different.

A few users are concerned about privacy and what happens to their videos in the cloud. Some suggest that if Mosaic works well, it could change how people make videos and open up new possibilities for small creators. Overall, the community is interested, but they have many questions about what the AI can really do.
