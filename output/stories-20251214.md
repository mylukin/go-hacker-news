## 2002: Last.fm and Audioscrobbler Herald the Social Web

- 原文链接: [2002: Last.fm and Audioscrobbler Herald the Social Web](https://cybercultural.com/p/lastfm-audioscrobbler-2002/)

This story is about how Last.fm and Audioscrobbler, two music websites from 2002, helped start the social web before Facebook and MySpace became popular. Both were student projects in the UK, and they used an idea called “collaborative filtering” to suggest new music and connect people based on their listening habits.

Last.fm let users build a music profile, share it, and get song recommendations by comparing their music taste with others. They visualized this as a “Map of Music,” showing how songs and genres connect based on what people listened to. The system learned what you liked over time, much like how Amazon suggested books or products using what is called “item-to-item collaborative filtering.”

Audioscrobbler, started by another student, Richard Jones, worked in a similar way. Users installed software that tracked what songs they played, then the system built a profile and recommended music. This process was called “scrobbling,” and soon, Audioscrobbler joined with Last.fm.

Both projects tried to move away from the old radio model, where DJs chose the music for everyone. Instead, users could start with their own favorite songs or a friend’s playlist, and the system would pick new songs to play, learning from what they liked, loved, or skipped. This mix of personal choice and smart recommendations was new at the time.

One big challenge was music licensing. At first, Last.fm could only play 30-second song samples unless users already owned the tracks. Over time, they paid for licenses to play full songs, turning into a true online radio service. The founders believed the best way to discover music was through friends, and they tried to bring this social sharing online.

In the comment section, some people remembered how exciting Last.fm was for finding new music. They liked how the site made music discovery personal. A few said they met friends through shared playlists, showing the social part really worked. Others pointed out that the mix of manual choice and algorithms felt fresh compared to old radio.

Some users discussed technical details, like how collaborative filtering was also used by Amazon. A few thought Last.fm’s interface was confusing at first, but they appreciated how it improved over time. There were comments about the legal issues with music streaming, and some said getting licenses was very hard back then. A few people missed the early, simple days of Last.fm, while others wished modern music apps had more social features like Last.fm once did. Some also compared Last.fm to newer services, saying the early focus on community and discovery was special.

## Hashcards: A plain-text spaced repetition system

- 原文链接: [Hashcards: A plain-text spaced repetition system](https://borretti.me/article/hashcards-plain-text-spaced-repetition)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46264492)

Hashcards is a new app for spaced repetition, like Anki or Mochi, but it stores your flashcards as plain Markdown text files in folders. Each deck is a Markdown file, and you write questions, answers, or cloze deletions using simple text. To study, you run a command and review cards in your web browser, while your review history is saved locally.

The main idea is to make card creation and editing easy, using any text editor you like. You can keep your flashcards in a Git repo, track changes, share with others, and use scripts or Unix tools to update or generate cards. The app uses FSRS, a modern algorithm for scheduling, so you get the best recall with less review time.

The author explains why they built Hashcards instead of using Anki or Mochi. Anki is powerful and open source, but the interface is ugly and hard to use. Simple tasks take too many steps, and the card editor is slow if you want to write lots of cards quickly. Plugins often break or feel messy.

Mochi looks good and uses Markdown, but making cloze deletions (hidden words) is more work. Mochi’s scheduling algorithm was weak until recently. If you forget a card, the interval doesn’t reset well, so you keep forgetting. You can change the settings, but the author prefers not to spend time tweaking options. Mochi also has fewer answer choices, making learning less flexible.

Hashcards focuses on smooth card creation and editing. The author found that writing and improving cards is the biggest challenge, so the format is simple and fast to type. Editing is easy because decks are just text files, so you can scroll and update related cards together. Using plain text with Git means you control, version, and share your flashcards easily. Scripts and command-line tools let you automate or bulk update cards.

In the Hacker News comments, many users like the idea of plain-text flashcards for transparency and control. Some praise the use of Git for version tracking and sharing, saying it makes their study process more open and flexible. Others point out that using Markdown and simple file formats means you’re not locked into one app, so your notes last longer.

A few commenters wonder if most people want this much manual control, or if it’s only for more technical users. Some wish for mobile support or syncing, while others prefer the simplicity of paper flashcards. There are concerns about losing advanced features from apps like Anki, such as media support or stats, but others say those are not important for everyone. Many agree that making card creation quick and easy is key for learning, and they appreciate the detailed explanation of Hashcards’ design choices. Some mention they might switch from Anki or Mochi, while others suggest adding import/export tools for easier migration. A few users ask about using Hashcards with teams or classrooms, and the author replies that it could work if everyone shares the same repo. Overall, the project is seen as a nice option for people who value plain text, control, and simple workflows.

## Do dyslexia fonts work? (2022)

- 原文链接: [Do dyslexia fonts work? (2022)](https://www.edutopia.org/article/do-dyslexia-fonts-actually-work/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46266094)

This article looks at special fonts made for people with dyslexia and asks if they really help. Many believe these fonts can make reading easier for people with dyslexia by changing the shape and weight of letters.

The article explains that dyslexia is not a problem with seeing letters, but with matching sounds to letters. Early ideas thought it was a vision problem, but research now shows it is a language-based difference. Some fonts, like OpenDyslexic and Dyslexie, are designed to help by making letters heavier at the bottom or changing their shapes. However, studies show these fonts do not help people with dyslexia read faster or more accurately. In fact, many children with dyslexia prefer normal fonts like Arial or Times New Roman.

Experts warn that telling students these fonts will help can make them feel worse if they do not see improvement. This can lead to disappointment and lower self-esteem. The British Dyslexia Association says that clear fonts are good for everyone, but special dyslexia fonts are not needed. Instead, it is better to use simple, clear fonts and a good font size, like 12 to 14 points, with clear headings to help with structure.

The real help for dyslexia comes from special teaching methods, not fonts. Methods that focus on phonics, awareness of word sounds, and repeated practice work best. Tools like audiobooks, note-taking apps, and text-to-speech software can also help students. The main takeaway is that special fonts do not solve reading problems for people with dyslexia.

In the comment section, some users say they have personally tried dyslexia fonts and did not find them helpful. Others point out that while the fonts do not help most people, some individuals may still prefer them, maybe due to personal comfort. A few commenters note that tech solutions, like text-to-speech, are more effective and helpful for people with dyslexia.

Some users discuss how the belief in a “quick fix” font might take attention away from real, evidence-based teaching methods. Others express frustration that schools and parents sometimes look for easy answers instead of supporting students with proper instruction. There are also comments suggesting that making text clearer helps everyone, not just people with dyslexia.

A few people share stories about family or friends with dyslexia, saying that what helped most was patient teaching, not special fonts. Some mention that using mainstream fonts with good spacing and no clutter is often the best choice. There is also some discussion about how myths about dyslexia being a vision problem are still common, even though research shows otherwise. Overall, commenters agree that supporting students with the right tools and teaching is more important than using special fonts.

## JSDoc is TypeScript

- 原文链接: [JSDoc is TypeScript](https://culi.bearblog.dev/jsdoc-is-typescript/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46266102)

This article explains that JSDoc and TypeScript are not rivals; instead, JSDoc is just another way to use TypeScript’s type checking and tooling. The author talks about a time when the Svelte project moved type info from TypeScript files to JSDoc comments, and some people thought this meant Svelte was moving away from TypeScript. But actually, Svelte’s team said they still loved TypeScript—they just wanted to keep using its tools without switching file types.

TypeScript started as a tool to help JavaScript developers write better code, kind of like how C# developers did things. Even if you write only JavaScript, if your editor gives you code hints or checks your types, it’s probably using the TypeScript engine under the hood. This means that JSDoc comments, which you might write in a regular .js file, are still being checked and understood by TypeScript. The TypeScript team even keeps adding new JSDoc features.

The author shares their own experience rewriting a project using only JSDoc comments. They found that almost anything you can do with TypeScript types, you can also do with JSDoc, though sometimes the syntax is more awkward. For example, generics are harder to write but can encourage better habits. They also liked that clicking on a function in their editor took them straight to the real code, not a separate type file. Plus, many TypeScript tools work just fine with JSDoc projects, including tools that generate types from things like OpenAPI or GraphQL schemas.

The main message is clear: using JSDoc for types isn’t anti-TypeScript; it’s just another way to use the same tools, often with fewer build steps.

In the Hacker News comments, some people agreed and said they use JSDoc because it fits better into JavaScript projects without adding extra build steps or new file types. Others pointed out that JSDoc syntax can be harder to read or write, especially for more complex types, and that TypeScript files (.ts) are more standard in bigger codebases. Some users liked that JSDoc keeps everything in one file, making code navigation easier. Others worried that JSDoc in comments could get messy or be ignored over time. A few mentioned that TypeScript can catch more errors before code runs, while JSDoc relies more on good discipline from developers. There was also debate about which approach works best for teams or open-source projects, with some saying TypeScript makes onboarding and code reviews easier. A few developers said they mix both styles, choosing JSDoc for simple scripts and TypeScript for bigger apps. Some people just want good autocomplete and docs, no matter how they get them. Overall, the discussion showed that both JSDoc and TypeScript have fans, and the best choice often depends on the project and the team.

## The Typeframe PX-88 Portable Computing System

- 原文链接: [The Typeframe PX-88 Portable Computing System](https://www.typeframe.net/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46265015)

The article talks about the Typeframe PX-88, a new portable computer made for people who want both power and a good typing experience. It uses a Raspberry Pi 4 B as its main part, so it can run web editors and other heavy tasks well, even though the machine is small.

The PX-88 has a mechanical keyboard, which means typing feels better and more accurate than on normal laptops. This is important for people who write a lot or work with code. The computer is also built so you can open it easily, change parts, or fix things without much trouble. You do not need to do much soldering to put it together, which makes it friendly for people who want to build their own machine but are not experts at electronics.

The idea is that it can be used as a "cyberdeck" for hacking projects, or as a "writerdeck" for writers—whatever you want. The company says the PX-88 is for professionals who care about quality, not just looks.

In the comments, some people are excited about the idea. They like the mix of a good keyboard and a powerful but small computer. Some say it reminds them of old computers from the 1980s and 1990s, which were easy to open and fix. A few people talk about how nice it is to see a device made to last and be easy to repair.

Others wonder how well the Raspberry Pi 4 can really work for more serious tasks. They point out that it is not as fast as a modern laptop or desktop computer. Some ask if it has a good battery life, or if it is heavy to carry around. A few people think the price might be high for what you get, while others say making your own computer should cost more because it is special.

One commenter likes that the PX-88 is made for people who want to build something themselves, even if it is not the fastest. Another person mentions that having access to all the parts makes it better than most laptops today, which are hard to fix. Some say they would love to see more computers like this, because it gives people more control over their tools. A few others share worries about software support and if it will be easy to use as a daily computer. Overall, the community is happy to see a portable computer that is different from the usual choices.

## In the Beginning was the Command Line (1999)

- 原文链接: [In the Beginning was the Command Line (1999)](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs81n/command.txt)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46189905)

This article is about how people use computers and how the way we use them has changed over time. The writer, Neal Stephenson, explains how command line interfaces (CLIs) and graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are different, and how companies like Microsoft and Apple built their success.

He starts by comparing computers and operating systems to cars. Microsoft is like a big car company selling station wagons, while Apple sells fancy European cars. There are also new options, like Linux, which is free but harder for most people to use, like driving a tank. Most people pick what is easy and familiar, even if better or cheaper choices are available.

The writer remembers learning to program by typing commands on old machines, where you had to think carefully about what you wanted the computer to do. With CLIs, you type instructions directly. GUIs, like Windows or Mac, use pictures and icons, which are easier for beginners but hide the details. This helps more people use computers, but also makes software more complicated and less reliable. He says that operating systems use metaphors—like calling a screen a "desktop" or a file a "document"—but these can be confusing if you take them too seriously.

The article also talks about how companies make money from software. Microsoft sells operating systems like a product, but as technology gets cheaper, it becomes hard to sell something that can be copied for free. Open source software like Linux is created by volunteers and given away, which changes the business. The writer argues that selling operating systems is becoming less important, and that companies will need to focus on selling applications or features instead.

He discusses how people like GUIs because they are easy, just like people enjoy theme parks or watching TV instead of reading books. It is more comfortable to use something simple, even if you lose some power or understanding. The writer worries that this makes people too dependent on technology and less able to think for themselves. He uses the example of Disney World, where everything is made to look perfect, but nothing is real or lasting. He thinks this is like modern computers, where the surface looks nice but the real work is hidden.

The article ends by saying that most people now use GUIs and do not know how the computer really works. This is not always bad—sometimes it is better to have something simple than nothing at all. But he warns that we should remember what we lose when we give up control and understanding for convenience.

Hacker News readers had many opinions about this essay. Some said it is still very true today: people want easy interfaces, even if they lose control. Others thought the essay was too negative about GUIs, arguing that most users just want to get things done and do not care about technical details. A few said that command lines are still important for programmers and power users, and that learning them is a valuable skill. Some praised Stephenson’s writing and his funny car analogies.

There were debates about open source software. Some readers said that open source has won in many ways (like Linux in servers), while others noted that most people still use Windows or Mac on their personal computers. Several comments pointed out that modern GUIs have improved a lot and are now more stable and powerful than before.

A few readers shared personal stories about first learning computers on the command line and how it helped them think more deeply. Others said that the world needs both easy interfaces and powerful tools, so beginners can start simple and experts can dig deeper. Some worried that too much focus on easy interfaces means people never learn the basics, which might be a problem in the future.

Many liked the cultural points about Disney and how people prefer experiences that are fun and easy, even if they are less real. Some pushed back, saying that this is just human nature and not a problem. Overall, readers enjoyed the essay for making them think about how technology, business, and culture all connect.

## Shai-Hulud compromised a dev machine and raided GitHub org access: a post-mortem

- 原文链接: [Shai-Hulud compromised a dev machine and raided GitHub org access: a post-mortem](https://trigger.dev/blog/shai-hulud-postmortem)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46262021)

This article tells the story of how Trigger.dev was hacked by Shai-Hulud, a dangerous npm malware that hit many companies in November 2025. The attack started when an engineer installed a new npm package for a test project, which secretly ran bad code on their laptop.

The malware used a tool called TruffleHog to search the computer for secrets like GitHub tokens and AWS keys, then sent them to the attacker. The attackers watched the engineer’s activity for 17 hours, copying 669 private and public repositories using different servers in the US and India. After waiting, the attacker tried to destroy code by force-pushing empty commits and closing pull requests in several repos. The attacks were automated and used the fake name “Linus Torvalds” for all the bad commits.

Luckily, a team member noticed a flood of Slack alerts and the team quickly removed the hacked account from GitHub, AWS, and other services. They found the damage included hundreds of cloned repos, many closed pull requests, and 199 branches force-pushed. But, no production databases or npm packages were harmed because extra security like 2FA was already required for publishing.

The team recovered by using backup commit info from GitHub events and local copies, restoring all branches in seven hours. They also found a private GitHub App key in the trash on the hacked laptop and rotated it just in case, even though there was no sign it was used by the attacker.

Trigger.dev changed many things after this attack. They made npm and pnpm ignore all install scripts by default, switched to safer publishing with OIDC, enabled branch protection everywhere, and reviewed GitHub Actions settings. They now use a tool called Granted to keep AWS tokens safer and recommend waiting at least three days before installing new packages (to catch malware early). They remind everyone to keep secrets out of local machines and to act fast if something seems off.

In the Hacker News comments, many developers feel worried, saying this attack could happen to anyone because npm allows packages to run scripts during install. Some people argue that disabling all install scripts will break builds for many projects, but others say security is more important and teams should whitelist only the scripts they trust. There is strong support for using tools like pnpm 10, which helps block new or untrusted packages, and for better secrets management.

People debate if developers or the npm ecosystem should be blamed for these attacks. Many think the real problem is how easy it is for any package to run code on your computer without warning. One user points out that even careful teams can get hit if just one person tries a new package. Others stress the need for fast team response and good Slack or alert systems, praising how the Trigger.dev team stopped the attack in minutes.

Some suggest package managers or npm itself should change their defaults, so install scripts are always off unless the user says yes. A few share tips like using virtual machines for testing unknown packages or making sure no long-lived tokens are saved locally. Lastly, many feel sorry for the engineer who got hacked, saying it could have happened to anyone, and that the real lesson is to improve the ecosystem and team habits, not to blame individuals.
