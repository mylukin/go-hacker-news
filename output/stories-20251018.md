## Is Postgres read heavy or write heavy?

- 原文链接: [Is Postgres read heavy or write heavy?](https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/is-postgres-read-heavy-or-write-heavy-and-why-should-you-care)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45619108)

This article talks about how to tell if your Postgres database is used more for reading data or writing data. Knowing this is important because it helps you make your database faster and more reliable.

If your app mostly reads from the database, like a social media site, you might need to focus on things like good indexes, caching, and maybe using read replicas. If your app writes a lot, like an IoT logger, you need to think about using fast storage, tuning how Postgres writes data, and keeping indexes simple.

Reads and writes are not the same for Postgres. Reading is usually easier because data often comes from memory. Writing is more complex: every write changes something called the WAL (Write-Ahead Log), might update indexes, and can use more disk input/output (IO). Writes can also cause extra reads because Postgres needs the data in memory before it can change it.

The article gives a sample SQL query to estimate how many reads and writes happen in each table. It uses internal Postgres stats and lets you choose what counts as “read-heavy” or “write-heavy.” For example, you can set the ratio to 5:1, so if a table has five times more reads than writes, it’s considered read-heavy.

The query breaks down activity into categories: read-heavy, write-heavy, read-only, write-only, or balanced. You can use this to see which tables you should tune for writing or reading.

Another way to measure read and write traffic is with the pg_stat_statements extension. This tool tracks how many rows are read or written by each query.

For write-heavy databases, you should use fast SSDs, give Postgres more RAM, avoid too many indexes, and tune how it handles logs and checkpoints. For read-heavy databases, you should set up good caching, add the right indexes, and use read replicas to spread the load.

Most Postgres databases are read-heavy. The article says a 10:1 read-to-write ratio is still not unusual. But every app is different, so you need to check your own stats.

In the comments, some people say it’s important not to guess—always check real stats, since some “obvious” workloads may surprise you. Others point out that what counts as a “read” or “write” can be tricky, because Postgres sometimes reads data for a write, or writes data during a read if it changes cache. 

A few users share their own experiences: one says their analytics database is 100:1 reads to writes, while another runs a logging system that’s almost all writes. Some warn that too many indexes slow down writes a lot, but help reads, so you must balance them. Others say that new features in Postgres, like asynchronous IO, help write-heavy workloads, but you still need to tune carefully.

One commenter reminds that cloud databases can have “bursty” IO, so stats might look different depending on the time of day. Another explains that tracking at table level is great, but sometimes slow queries come from just a few big tables, so always check your slow query logs too.

Lastly, several users say the main lesson is to keep watching your database stats as your app grows, so you can adjust your setup when your usage changes.

## Root System Drawings

- 原文链接: [Root System Drawings](https://images.wur.nl/digital/collection/coll13/search)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45627394)

This article shares a link to a digital collection of plant root system drawings from Wageningen University. The collection shows detailed images of how different plant roots grow and spread in the soil.

The main idea is to give people access to scientific drawings of plant roots. The drawings are old, made by hand, and show many types of plants. Each image shows the roots in different shapes and depths, sometimes with the whole plant and sometimes just the root system. People who study plants, soil, or farming can use these drawings to learn more about how roots work underground. The collection is organized so you can search by plant name or other details. The images are high quality and free to look at. This is useful for researchers, teachers, and anyone curious about plants. The drawings are also helpful for comparing how different plants grow. Some roots are deep and long, and others are short and wide. The drawings make it easy to see these differences. The pictures can also help people who design gardens or want to understand how to grow crops better.

In the comment section, many people are excited to see such a collection online. Some users say it’s rare to find such good drawings of roots, since most plant books only show the leaves and flowers. A few commenters talk about how roots are very important for plant health and soil quality, but often ignored. Others mention that these drawings might help with gardening, farming, or restoring nature. Some people wish there were more modern versions of these drawings, maybe made with computers or scans. One person is impressed by the skill of the artists who made the hand-drawn images. Another user points out that having these online helps more people learn about botany. A few are surprised at how different root systems can look, even for plants that seem similar above ground. Some wonder if the collection could be even better with more search tools or extra information about each plant. Overall, people like that this resource is free and easy to use.

## How to sequence your DNA for <$2k

- 原文链接: [How to sequence your DNA for <$2k](https://maxlangenkamp.substack.com/p/how-to-sequence-your-dna-for-2k)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45629970)

This article is about how a group of friends tried to sequence their own DNA at home for less than $2,000. DNA sequencing used to take billions of dollars and years, but now, small devices like the Oxford Nanopore MinION make it possible for regular people to try it themselves.

The process starts with getting a blood sample, which was harder than expected because the author used small diabetes lancets. They had to prick a finger many times to get enough blood. Next, they used a Zymo DNA extraction kit to separate the DNA from other parts in the blood, like red blood cells, which do not have DNA. A mini centrifuge helped spin and filter the sample. Instead of a costly thermal cycler, they used an electric kettle and bucket to heat the samples.

The main tool was the Oxford Nanopore MinION, which costs about $1,000 and connects to a computer’s USB port. After prepping the DNA with special adapter molecules, they loaded it into the device. The MinION works by pulling DNA strands through tiny holes and reading the electrical signals to guess the DNA letters (A, T, C, G). They watched the sequencing happen in real time with special software.

In the end, they sequenced about one gigabase of DNA, which is about 13% of a human genome. Some problems came up: only part of the device worked (many pores were broken), 25% of the data was from bacteria instead of human DNA, and most of the genome was not covered enough to see important genetic markers. Still, they were able to do a large part of DNA sequencing at home for around $1,100.

In the Hacker News comments, some readers were excited that anyone can try DNA sequencing at home now and called this a big step for personal science. Some, though, pointed out the results were not enough for real medical or ancestry analysis. Others talked about how even with cheap machines, understanding and using the data is still very hard for most people. There were warnings about privacy risks and questions about whether it’s safe to have your genetic data on home computers or the internet. A few people remembered when sequencing was only for big labs and were amazed at the low cost today. Others wondered about what new things might be possible if more hobbyists could sequence DNA. Some were worried about contamination, explaining that keeping samples clean is very difficult outside a lab. There was also advice about using saliva instead of blood to make the process easier. One commenter wished there were better guides for analyzing the DNA results, not just generating them. People discussed how this could help in education, but also pointed out the risks if people misunderstand their genetic information. Overall, the comments showed a mix of excitement, curiosity, and caution about home DNA science.

## Flowistry: An IDE plugin for Rust that focuses on relevant code

- 原文链接: [Flowistry: An IDE plugin for Rust that focuses on relevant code](https://github.com/willcrichton/flowistry)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45627692)

Flowistry is a plugin for VSCode that helps Rust programmers focus on the parts of code that matter most for their task. It works by showing which parts of the code affect or are affected by the variable or expression you select, fading out the rest.

The core idea is information flow analysis: Flowistry checks how data moves inside your Rust functions. When you click on a variable, Flowistry highlights only the relevant code that changes or uses that variable. This helps you read and understand big or complex functions because you can ignore unrelated lines. For example, in a function that works with sets, you can see which parts of the code are truly connected to a certain value. In the Rust compiler itself, Flowistry can filter out most of the code not related to your focus.

The tool is available as a VSCode extension, and you can install it from the Visual Studio Marketplace or build it from source. If you want, you can also use the core analysis through a Rust crate. However, Flowistry supports only Rust up to version 1.73 and does not work out-of-the-box on NixOS or ARM Macs (like M1) without building from source.

To use Flowistry, you open your Rust project, activate focus mode, and click on variables or expressions to see the flow. You can set a “mark” to keep the focus while checking other code, and even select the whole focus region for editing or copying.

There are some known problems: Flowistry cannot fully track data changes when using types like Arc<Mutex<T>> (“interior mutability”). Sometimes it highlights more code than you expect because it’s cautious about what could be affected. Not every code piece is selectable, especially if it doesn’t map clearly from source to the compiler’s internal view. Also, it only looks at one function at a time, so nested functions or async code might not be fully covered.

Now, let’s look at what people said in the comments. Many developers are excited, saying this tool could make reading and debugging Rust code much easier. Some users wish this kind of feature was built into Rust Analyzer, but others explain that Flowistry needs special parts of the compiler (MIR and the borrow checker) that Rust Analyzer doesn’t have yet. A few people are concerned about the plugin’s support for only certain Rust versions and platforms, especially as Rust changes fast.

Some commenters point out that the slow analysis on big functions could be a problem in large codebases, but others say the benefits of focusing attention are worth waiting a few seconds. There’s praise for the research work behind Flowistry, as it’s based on published academic papers. Others suggest that similar tools would help in other languages, not just Rust.

A few users express confusion about some of the focus results—why certain lines are included or left out—but the documentation explains these cases and encourages people to ask questions or report issues. Some developers are already thinking about how this tool could help them with code reviews or understanding unfamiliar open-source projects. Overall, the community response is positive, with many hoping for further improvements and wider support.

## Who invented deep residual learning?

- 原文链接: [Who invented deep residual learning?](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/who-invented-residual-neural-networks.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45567050)

This article is about who really invented deep residual learning, a key idea in modern AI. It explains the history and main people behind residual neural networks, showing it started much earlier than many think.

The article says the first use of residual connections was by Sepp Hochreiter in 1991, in his diploma thesis supervised by Jürgen Schmidhuber. Hochreiter’s idea was to use a connection in a neural network with a weight of 1.0, which helped solve the vanishing gradient problem. This is important because it allows neural networks to be very deep, letting errors flow back through the network without getting lost. In 1997, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model used this idea and became very successful for tasks like speech and language. LSTM’s special cells, called “constant error carrousels,” use these residual connections to remember information over hundreds or thousands of steps.

Later, in 1999, LSTM was improved with “gated” residual connections that could be opened or closed, allowing the network to reset itself when needed. In 2005, researchers saw that the same idea could be used in feedforward networks, not just recurrent ones. In May 2015, the Highway Network was introduced by Schmidhuber’s students, adding gates to these residual connections in deep feedforward networks, making them much deeper and more powerful. Then, in December 2015, the famous ResNet paper came out, using open-gated residual connections (basically Highway Networks with the gates always open). ResNet’s success made the idea very popular, especially after it won the ImageNet 2015 competition.

The article stresses that a real residual connection has weight 1.0, not just any shortcut between layers. It also says that Highway Networks and ResNets are very similar—ResNet is just a Highway Net with open gates. The ResNet paper cited Highway Networks but did not make clear how closely related they are. The article points out that the Highway Network was published first and that much of the credit for deep residual learning should go to Hochreiter, Schmidhuber, and their teams.

In the comments, some readers agree with the article and thank Schmidhuber for the detailed timeline. They appreciate the focus on who really invented core ideas. Others say that in research, similar ideas can appear at the same time in different places, and credit is often messy. A few people defend the ResNet authors, saying their work made residual learning practical and famous. Some think the debate about who invented what is less important than the progress made, while others feel it is important to recognize original work. A few commenters point out that naming and explaining ideas in a simple way, like in the ResNet paper, is also very valuable. There are also comments about how science often forgets earlier work, and that happens in many fields, not just AI. Some users joke about the long history of rediscovery in machine learning. Finally, several readers say that both the early and later work were important for making deep learning what it is today.

## Tinnitus Neuromodulator

- 原文链接: [Tinnitus Neuromodulator](https://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/neuromodulationTonesGenerator.php)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45628391)

The article is about a free online tool called the Tinnitus Neuromodulator, found on myNoise.net, which helps people manage tinnitus by playing special sounds. Many users share their personal stories about how these sounds reduce or mask the ringing in their ears.

Most users say the tool gives real relief, sometimes making their tinnitus disappear for a short time after listening. Some people find that after using the sounds for a few minutes, their tinnitus is quieter or gone when they remove their headphones, which feels “like magic.” People enjoy how customizable the sounds are; they can adjust sliders to find a mix that works best for their own type of tinnitus. For some, the tool is better than white noise or expensive hearing aids, and it’s free. Users mention it helps with focus, sleep, and even anxiety caused by tinnitus. Some comment that it blends with their tinnitus rather than covers it, making the noise less annoying. Others without tinnitus also use the tool for focus, relaxation, or because they enjoy the strange, calming soundscapes. A few people say it helps more than music or other noise generators.

Not everyone finds it helpful. A small number of users report that the sounds made their tinnitus worse, gave them headaches, or just didn’t mask their specific ringing. Some wish the generator had more options, like tuning the frequency to match their own tinnitus. There are also requests for a standalone device, and comments about how the tool could be improved. Some users are unsure if the relief is real or just a placebo effect, but many feel the effect is strong and valuable. People appreciate how the tool is easy to use, and several plan to donate or already have. Others use the site for related problems like misophonia, hyperacusis, or even ADHD. Many say the tool is a “lifesaver” and thank the creators for improving their quality of life. A few people simply enjoy playing with the sounds and settings, finding it fun or relaxing even if they don’t have tinnitus. Some users combine the neuromodulator with other sounds on the site for unique experiences. In the end, most agree the tool offers real relief, even if only for a little while, and are grateful it exists.

Yang Chen-Ning, a famous physicist and China’s first Nobel Prize winner, has died at age 103 in Beijing. He was known around the world for his work in physics and for helping connect Chinese science with the rest of the world. Yang won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1957 with Tsung-Dao Lee for their theory about “parity non-conservation” in weak interactions, which was a big change in how scientists understood the laws of nature. He was also one of the creators of the Yang-Mills theory, a key part of the Standard Model in particle physics, which is as important as some of the biggest ideas in science like Maxwell’s equations and Einstein’s relativity.

Yang was born in Anhui, China, in 1922. He studied at top Chinese universities before moving to the United States in 1945, where he got his PhD at the University of Chicago. He worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, then became a professor at Stony Brook University in New York. After many years in the U.S., Yang returned to China, where he worked at Tsinghua University and helped start the Institute for Advanced Study there. He cared a lot about science education in China and helped many young scholars study abroad. He also gave advice for big science projects and worked to improve science teaching in China.

Yang was respected by many around the world and was a member of several science academies. He received many awards and honorary degrees. He is remembered as a legend in physics and as someone who helped build a bridge between China and the international science community.

In the Hacker News comments, many users praised Yang’s work, saying the Yang-Mills theory changed physics forever. Some pointed out that his Nobel Prize discovery about parity helped set the stage for later big findings in particle physics. A few users shared stories about how Yang’s work inspired them to study science or physics. Some commenters talked about his role in bringing Chinese scholars to the U.S. and back, saying this helped Chinese science grow. Others discussed the importance of scientists returning to their home countries to help local education and research. A few people mentioned that Yang lived a long, productive life and kept working on physics even in his later years. One user explained the Yang-Mills theory in simple terms for others who were not physicists. There was also talk about Yang’s leadership at Tsinghua and how he helped build up that university. Some praised his efforts to connect China and the U.S. during the Cold War era. A few people debated whether he or Tsung-Dao Lee had a bigger impact on physics, but most agreed both were key to modern science. Many users said they felt sad at his passing, but grateful for his life and work.

## ./watch

- 原文链接: [./watch](https://dotslashwatch.com/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45626130)

This article is about a watch called “./watch” that shows off its electronic parts, instead of hiding them. The designer wanted the watch to look like computer hardware and to remind people of the command-line interface on computers.

The watch uses quartz technology, which means it has a small electronic circuit inside to keep time. Most quartz watches try to cover up their wires and chips, making them look more like traditional watches. But this watch does the opposite. Its face shows off exposed parts like chips, traces, and even some numbers that look like digital code. The design even includes details that look like buttons or prompts from a computer terminal. The name “./watch” is a play on how you’d run a program from a command line, which fits the tech theme.

The creator wanted to make something special for people who love computers and electronics. By leaving the circuit boards visible, the watch feels more honest and direct about what it is. This design choice is also a bit playful, because it makes you think of hacking and coding when you look at your wrist. The article says this watch is for people who enjoy both technology and design. It’s not trying to be fancy or hide its true self—it’s proud of being a digital watch.

In the comments, some people love the idea. They think the exposed electronics look cool and clever, and that the watch is perfect for computer fans. A few say they would buy this watch just because it feels “geeky” and different from normal watches. Others remember old Casio watches and like how this one updates the idea for today.

But not everyone agrees. Some users worry that the open design might make the watch easy to break or damage. A few think it looks a bit too much like a toy, or that it might not fit with all kinds of clothes. Some people mention that it might be hard to read the time if the design gets too busy. Still, most comments seem positive, with many users happy to see a watch that celebrates technology in a fun way. Some even hope for more gadgets like this in the future.

## Solution to CIA’s Kryptos sculpture is found in Smithsonian vault

- 原文链接: [Solution to CIA’s Kryptos sculpture is found in Smithsonian vault](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/science/kryptos-cia-solution-sanborn-auction.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45603876)

The article talks about the famous Kryptos sculpture at the CIA headquarters and how its final puzzle was unsolved for 35 years. Two fans found the solution in a Smithsonian vault just as the artist, Jim Sanborn, was planning to auction off the answer.

Kryptos is a copper sculpture made by Sanborn in 1990. It has four secret messages cut into it. Many people, including expert codebreakers, solved the first three parts, called K1, K2, and K3. But the fourth part, K4, stayed a mystery for a long time. Sanborn often got emails from people who thought they had solved it, but none were correct. The story changed when two fans found the real answer hidden in the Smithsonian’s collection. This happened while Sanborn was about to sell the official solution. The article explains how the puzzle has fascinated and frustrated people for decades. It also talks about the special place Kryptos has in both art and spy history. The solution to K4 was finally found in old records, not by cracking the code directly.

In the Hacker News comments, some people are amazed it took so long to find the answer. Others feel a bit let down that the solution came from an archive, not from solving the puzzle itself. A few users discuss how hard K4 was and wonder if it was even possible to solve with the clues given. Some enjoy the mix of art and cryptography and think Kryptos is a great example of this. Others talk about the importance of keeping mysteries alive and how the hunt for answers can be just as fun as finding them. One commenter thinks it’s fitting that a secret at the CIA ended up in a museum vault. Another says the story shows how history and secrets often hide in plain sight. Some users are curious if the full solution will now be made public. A few suggest new puzzles should be made to keep the challenge going. There are also points about how technology has changed codebreaking since 1990. Finally, some simply thank the artist for inspiring so many people to learn about cryptography.
