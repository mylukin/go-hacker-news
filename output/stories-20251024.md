- 原文链接: [The Swift SDK for Android](https://www.swift.org/blog/nightly-swift-sdk-for-android/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45698570)

Swift now has an official SDK for Android, letting developers write Android apps using the Swift language. This is a big step, since Swift was mostly used for Apple platforms before, and now it aims to support more cross-platform development.

The new Swift SDK is available as nightly previews, and you can get it on Windows, Linux, or macOS. There’s a Getting Started guide to help people set up their first Swift code on Android devices. The team also shared example projects to show how things work from start to finish. About a quarter of Swift packages already work on Android, and there’s a showcase listing which packages are compatible. Developers can use ‘swift-java’ to connect Swift and Java code, making it easier to build real Android apps that mix both languages. This tool can automatically generate code to allow Swift and Java to work together safely and quickly. The post encourages developers to join the community, share their ideas, and follow the progress on forums and project boards. The team is also working on a vision document for the future of Swift on Android, which will guide development and improvements.

In the comments, many people are excited about the news. Some think it will make app development easier for teams who already use Swift on Apple devices. Others wonder if Swift can become popular on Android, since most Android developers are used to Java or Kotlin. A few users are worried about how well Swift will work with Android’s tools and if there will be problems with updates or support. Some developers like the idea of more code sharing between iOS and Android apps, which could save time and effort. Others point out that there have been efforts to bring other languages to Android before, but they never became very popular. There are questions about what kind of apps will benefit most and if companies will really switch to Swift for Android. Some users are also interested in the technical side—how good the Java-Swift interop is, and if performance will be as good as native Java or Kotlin apps. Overall, the mood is hopeful but cautious, with many developers waiting to see how the project grows and how the community reacts.

## I invited strangers to message me through a receipt printer

- 原文链接: [I invited strangers to message me through a receipt printer](https://aschmelyun.com/blog/i-invited-strangers-to-message-me-through-a-receipt-printer/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45633877)

This article is about a developer who let strangers send him messages that print out on a receipt printer at his desk. He built a simple website so anyone can write a message, and when they click send, the message prints out right away on a real receipt printer next to him.

He used an old Epson thermal receipt printer, which prints by heating special paper—so it never needs ink. The printer uses a special command language (ESC/POS) to understand what to print. Because the printer is old, he couldn’t use normal drivers with his computer, so he connected it to a Raspberry Pi instead. On the Pi, the printer shows up as a device file, so he can send data straight to it.

To make the messages work, he built a website using PHP and the Laravel framework. The site checks messages for length and special characters, since the printer only supports basic letters, numbers, and a few symbols. Fun characters and emojis don’t print well, so he blocked them. Messages are saved in a database in case the printer stops working.

He runs the website directly on the Raspberry Pi, inside a Docker container, and uses Cloudflare Tunnels to let people access it from anywhere on the internet. This setup is simple and cheap, with everything running at his desk.

After sharing the project online, he got over a thousand messages from all over the world. People sent jokes, poems, ASCII art, and greetings from many countries. He even started pinning locations on a world map based on the messages. Most messages were friendly, showing people liked the idea of sending something physical and anonymous.

In the Hacker News comments, some people loved the playful idea and praised the mix of old tech with the internet. Others thought it was a fun way to create real-world connections using simple tools. A few discussed the technical setup, like using ESC/POS and Docker, and shared tips for handling character sets or printing images. Some worried about spam or abuse, but the author said most messages were positive. There were suggestions for improving security, adding message filtering, or letting the printer print images or more characters. Others wondered if something like this could work in public spaces or for art projects. A few readers shared their own similar experiments with receipt printers and Raspberry Pis, saying it’s a great way to learn about hardware and networking. Overall, people saw it as a creative, harmless, and joyful little project.

- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45642571)

Valetudo is software that lets you use your robot vacuum without sending any data to the cloud. The creator built it because he wanted a vacuum that works locally and respects privacy.

Valetudo started in 2018 and now works well for thousands of users. It is open-source, meaning you can see and change the code. There is no company behind it—just a hobbyist and some helpers. Valetudo does not collect data or use telemetry, so the creator does not know how many people use it. If you want to buy a robot that works with Valetudo, there is a guide on the website. The software is licensed under Apache-2.0, so you are free to use and change it, but you should not sell it as your own. The project is not meant to grow into a business or reach many people. The creator compares it to a private garden that anyone can visit, but you must respect the owner’s rules. If you don’t like how Valetudo works, you can leave or make your own version.

Many top comments on Hacker News praise Valetudo for letting people keep control of their devices. Some users say they hate that normal vacuums send maps of their homes to companies in other countries. Others like that Valetudo is simple and “just works” after setup. A few people share stories about using Valetudo on cheap robot vacuums to make them private and reliable. Some commenters say installing Valetudo can be tricky and not every vacuum is supported. Others wish more smart devices had options like this, so they could avoid the cloud. A few warn that updates and support might be harder with community projects like Valetudo. Some think big companies may not like this project and could try to block it. Overall, most users are happy to see an open, local option and hope more devices will offer privacy like this in the future.

## MRI Contrast Agent Causes Harmful Metal Buildup in Some Patients [study]

- 原文链接: [MRI Contrast Agent Causes Harmful Metal Buildup in Some Patients [study]](https://www.ormanager.com/briefs/study-mri-contrast-agent-causes-harmful-metal-buildup-in-some-patients/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45698909)

A new study says that MRI contrast agents, which help make MRI scans clearer, can sometimes cause harmful metal buildup in patients. The problem is with gadolinium, a metal used in these agents, which is usually safe and leaves the body quickly. But the study found that in some people, gadolinium stays in the body for years, building up in the brain, kidneys, blood, and urine. This can lead to health problems like nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, a rare but serious disease.

The study explains that gadolinium can react with oxalic acid, a chemical found in some foods and made by the body after eating vitamin C. This reaction can break gadolinium away from the chemical that normally keeps it safe, creating tiny metal particles. These nanoparticles can enter cells in different organs and may cause harm. The lead researcher, Dr. Wagner, even said that he avoids vitamin C before getting an MRI with contrast, because it could make the reaction worse.

The study also found that even one MRI with contrast can leave gadolinium in the body, and not everyone is affected the same way. Some people’s bodies hold onto more gadolinium, maybe because of their unique body chemistry or diet. The researchers think these metal nanoparticles can trigger a strong immune response, which may explain why some people have worse symptoms than others.

To learn more, the researchers are starting a registry to collect data from patients. They will study blood, urine, hair, and fingernail samples to see who is most at risk and how long gadolinium stays in the body.

In the Hacker News comments, some users were surprised and worried, especially if they or their family members had past MRI scans. Others pointed out that gadolinium risks have been discussed for years, but this study adds new details about why it happens. Some people argued that MRI contrast is still important for finding serious health problems and should not be avoided without good reason. A few said doctors should warn patients about the risks and suggest ways to lower them, like not taking vitamin C before a scan.

Many users wanted more research and better rules for using gadolinium in medicine. Some said safer alternatives should be found, while others worried about causing too much fear and stopping people from getting needed scans. A few people shared personal stories—some had no problems after many MRIs, while others said they got sick but doctors did not believe it was from gadolinium. Overall, the comments showed a mix of caution, worry, and hope that this new research will lead to safer medical practices.

## First shape found that can't pass through itself

- 原文链接: [First shape found that can't pass through itself](https://www.quantamagazine.org/first-shape-found-that-cant-pass-through-itself-20251024/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45694856)

This article is about a new shape called the "Noperthedron," which is the first known shape that cannot pass through a hole bored in a copy of itself. For hundreds of years, mathematicians thought every convex polyhedron could do this, a property called the "Rupert property."

The story started in the 1600s when Prince Rupert made a bet about whether a cube could pass through another cube. Mathematicians later proved it was possible if you drill a hole in just the right direction. Over time, more shapes, like the tetrahedron and octahedron, were shown to have this property. Even very complex shapes, like soccer balls and dodecahedrons, let a copy pass through.

Recently, researchers wondered if every convex polyhedron could do this, but no one could find a shape that didn't work—until now. Two mathematicians, Jakob Steininger and Sergey Yurkevich, found and proved that the Noperthedron, which has 90 corners and 152 flat faces, does not have the Rupert property. They used computers and new math ideas to check every possible way the shape could be turned and drilled, showing that no tunnel would let another Noperthedron pass through.

The main idea comes from looking at the "shadow" a shape makes when light shines on it. If a shape’s shadow in one position fits inside the shadow in another position, the shape can pass through. For most shapes, computers quickly find a way this works, but for some, like the Noperthedron, it never works. The proof involved cutting the problem into millions of small parts and showing none of them allow passage.

In the Hacker News comments, many users found the story fascinating and loved how a simple question led to deep math. Some were amazed that a centuries-old problem was only just solved. Others liked the story about Prince Rupert and how it connects history and math. A few users discussed the use of computers and algorithms in modern math, noting how hard it would be to solve these problems by hand.

One commenter wondered if there are more shapes like the Noperthedron, or if it is unique. Another pointed out that this shows how not every pattern in math continues forever—sometimes, there are surprising exceptions. Some users talked about 3D printing the Noperthedron and using it as a pencil holder, showing the fun side of math.

A few people asked if this research has any practical use, while others said that the joy of the discovery is enough. Some explained the technical parts in simpler ways, so everyone could understand. There was excitement about future discoveries, and many said this kind of work keeps math interesting and alive.

## How to make a Smith chart

- 原文链接: [How to make a Smith chart](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2025/10/23/smith-chart/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45696838)

This article explains the math behind how to make a Smith chart, which is used in electrical engineering. It looks at how a special function, f(z) = (z−1)/(z+1), changes a normal grid from the right half of the plane into circles and lines on the Smith chart.

The function is called a Möbius transformation. These transformations always turn straight lines and circles into more lines or circles. The article first shows that the imaginary axis (the up-and-down axis) turns into the unit circle, which is a circle with radius 1. It does this by looking at where three points (0, i, and –i) go after the transformation—they land on the unit circle.

The right half of the grid (everything to the right of the imaginary axis) gets mapped into the inside of the unit circle. The point z = 1 goes to the center (w = 0), so the inside of the circle is the important part.

Vertical lines in the original grid (lines that go straight up and down) become circles inside the Smith chart. These circles always touch the unit circle at the point w = 1. This is because all the vertical lines “meet” at infinity, which also maps to w = 1.

Horizontal lines (lines that go left to right) mostly turn into other circles, except for the real axis (the main horizontal line), which becomes a straight line. For most horizontal lines, their transformed circles also pass through w = 1. If you only look at the right half of each horizontal line, you only see part of the circle inside the unit circle. The positive real axis specifically becomes the line from –1 to 1 inside the circle.

Because Möbius transformations keep angles the same, the new circles for vertical and horizontal lines cross each other at right angles on the Smith chart. The article notes that if you just take a normal, evenly spaced grid and transform it, you get a Smith chart that’s crowded on one side and empty on the other. So, to make a useful Smith chart, you need to start with more lines close together near the imaginary axis.

Commenters on Hacker News found the explanation clear and liked the focus on how the chart is made, not just its uses. Some pointed out that understanding Möbius transformations helps not only with Smith charts but also in other areas of math and engineering. A few readers shared that they had only used Smith charts as a tool and never thought about the math behind them. Others said that this kind of post helps demystify complex diagrams.

One comment suggested adding a step-by-step drawing to help people see the transformation process. Another user mentioned that Smith charts are still useful today, even though many calculations are now done by computer. Some people discussed how the Smith chart helps visualize complex impedance, making tricky problems easier to understand.

A few users debated whether more engineers should learn the math behind tools like the Smith chart, or if it’s enough to just know how to use them. Someone also linked to other resources about Möbius transformations for those who want to learn more. A couple of commenters wondered how the Smith chart might be used in fields outside electrical engineering.

Overall, the discussion showed that people enjoy seeing the math behind familiar tools and that clear explanations can help both beginners and experts.

## Modern Perfect Hashing

- 原文链接: [Modern Perfect Hashing](https://blog.sesse.net/blog/tech/2025-10-23-21-23_modern_perfect_hashing.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45689905)

This article talks about making perfect hash functions for a fixed set of strings, like CSS keywords, to quickly map each string to a number. The author explains how he wrote code that does this faster and with less code than the standard tool, gperf, but it was not used in production because the speedup was not important enough.

The main idea is: if you know all your strings ahead of time, you can make a better hash than a normal hash table. First, the strings are split into groups by length. This makes later checks faster, because you can use fast memory comparison without bounds checks. Next, the author discusses a method called PEXT, but he does not use it because it is slow on some CPUs and not available everywhere.

Instead, the author borrows an idea from chess programming called “magic bitboards.” He finds a “magic” number and multiplies it by some bytes from the string, then shifts bits to pick an index. If you pick the right “magic,” every string gets a different index with no collisions. The code then checks the string at that index to make sure it is correct, and returns the answer if it matches.

The article gives examples with short and long CSS keywords. Sometimes, with a small group, you do not need any hash—just a simple compare. To find a “magic” number, the code tries many numbers until it finds one that works. To make this search faster, it remembers which string pairs often collide and tries to avoid them first.

If no good “magic” number is found, the code splits the group in other ways and tries again. The author found that splitting groups is tricky and can make the code generator slow. In the end, his solution made code that was smaller and twice as fast as gperf, but the build process was slower.

In the comments, many people liked the technical details and the clear examples. Some users pointed out that the “magic” numbers approach is clever and well-known in chess engines, but not common in general hash tables. A few commenters asked about handling much larger sets of strings, and others suggested that for small sets, the speed difference often does not matter. Some developers discussed trade-offs: the generated code is fast and small, but the build time and complexity can be high.

A few readers wondered if the extra speed is really needed in most real-world cases, since normal hash tables are usually “fast enough.” Others liked how the method avoids hardware-specific instructions, making it portable. Some mentioned that for very large datasets, other perfect hashing methods or tools might work better. There was also talk about whether this approach could replace gperf, and if it is worth the extra work for most teams. Lastly, some users thanked the author for sharing the code and ideas, saying it helped them learn more about perfect hashing and code generation.

## Why formalize mathematics – more than catching errors

- 原文链接: [Why formalize mathematics – more than catching errors](https://rkirov.github.io/posts/why_lean/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45632894)

This article talks about why formalizing mathematics with tools like Lean is useful, not just for catching errors. The writer explains that while computers can help find mistakes in math proofs, there are more reasons to use formal math.

The author enjoys using Lean to write proofs for math exercises, saying it's fun like solving puzzles with a computer. He also thinks formalization gives more value than just checking for errors. He compares it to TypeScript, a tool for programming in JavaScript. TypeScript adds rules to JavaScript code, and while it can catch errors, its real value comes from other features.

For example, TypeScript helps build better tools for developers, like clicking to see where a function is defined, or finding where it's used. It also lets teams talk about designs before writing code, and shows problems in code right away as people type. These benefits make working with code easier and more organized.

The author says Lean gives similar benefits for math. With Lean, mathematicians can get features like looking up definitions fast, searching for theorems, and refactoring proofs, just like programmers do with code. It also makes it easy to see which proofs depend on others, helping people discover new proof paths or see the structure of math. If a proof is taken back, Lean can help find which other proofs are affected, making math more reliable.

Formalizing makes math more efficient and enjoyable, but it means writing out lots of small, simple proofs that might feel boring. In Lean, every step needs a proof, but new tools are making this easier. Even just writing out the statements of theorems, without full proofs, can be very valuable for organizing and sharing math.

In the comments, some people agree that formalizing math gives many benefits besides catching mistakes. They like the idea of better tools and making math more like software engineering. Others say that writing every small proof can take too much time and energy, and not all mathematicians will want to learn new tools. Some worry that strict formalization might slow down creative thinking or make math less fun. A few people point out that informal ways of sharing math, like LaTeX, are still useful and easier for many. But many commenters are excited about the future, saying that as tools like Lean improve, more people will want to use them, and math will become more open and connected. Some share their own stories of using proof assistants and finding them helpful for learning or teaching. Others are hopeful that these changes will make math more reliable for everyone, not just experts.
