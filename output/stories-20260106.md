## Spherical Snake

- 原文链接: [Spherical Snake](https://kevinalbs.com/spherical_snake/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46451768)

This article is about a new version of the classic Snake game, but this time, the snake moves on a sphere instead of a flat surface. The game is called “Spherical Snake,” and you can play it online using your keyboard arrows.

The main idea is that, unlike regular Snake games where you move up, down, left, or right on a 2D grid, here you move on the surface of a 3D sphere. This changes how you think about directions. The snake can go all the way around the sphere, and what looks like “up” from one side may be “down” from another. The controls are simple: just use the arrow keys to move the snake. The game tracks your score, and you can submit it to an online leaderboard. There’s also a public GitHub page, so you can see how the code works or even suggest changes. The creator shares that building the game involved some tricky math to make the snake move smoothly on a round surface. The game tries to keep the movement natural, even as the direction changes with the curve of the sphere.

In the Hacker News comments, people are excited about the creative twist on the classic Snake game. Some users say it’s fun and challenging because you need to think differently about space and movement. Others discuss the math and code behind making the snake travel on a sphere, pointing out that it’s harder than on a flat grid. A few commenters share ideas for improving the game, like adding 3D graphics or using touch controls for mobile. One person notes that it’s a good teaching tool for understanding geometry and spherical coordinates. Some think the controls take a bit of getting used to, but the game is still enjoyable. Others ask technical questions about how the snake’s body is drawn and how collisions work on a sphere. A couple of users mention that the leaderboard is a nice touch for friendly competition. There are also some who suggest performance improvements for smoother play. Finally, many thank the creator for making the game open source and easy to try.

## Oral microbiome sequencing after taking probiotics

- 原文链接: [Oral microbiome sequencing after taking probiotics](https://blog.booleanbiotech.com/oral-microbiome-biogaia)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46518804)

This article is about a person testing an oral probiotic called BioGaia Prodentis to see if it changes the bacteria in their mouth. BioGaia is a Swedish company that sells probiotics, and some of their products have strong science behind them, especially for gut health in babies. The writer used a service called Plasmidsaurus to sequence their oral microbiome before, during, and after taking the probiotic for 30 days.

The main goal was to check if the probiotic bacteria, L. reuteri, would appear in the mouth after using Prodentis. The experiment included four saliva samples: two before taking the probiotic, one on the last day, and one a week after stopping. The sequencing method focused on the 16S region, which helps find out which bacteria are present.

No L. reuteri was found in any sample, even after careful checking. This suggests the probiotic did not colonize the mouth, or was there only briefly, or was too rare to detect. The author notes that probiotics often don’t stick around in the body, which is why people need to keep taking them.

However, there was a big increase in another bacteria, S. salivarius, after the probiotic course ended. S. salivarius is itself a probiotic and is sold for oral health. Its rise happened after the probiotic was stopped, so it’s unclear if the two are related. Another change was an increase in Veillonella, which may feed on things produced by S. salivarius.

The author also saw that some bacteria stayed the same across all samples, while others changed a lot, even between two samples taken just days apart. This shows the mouth’s bacteria mix can change quickly. The writer concludes that microbiome sequencing is now easy and useful, BioGaia tastes good, and they might try it again, but the probiotic did not show up in the results.

In the comment section, people had different views. Some were surprised that the probiotic did not appear at all, and a few questioned if the sequencing method was sensitive enough. Others pointed out that many probiotics don’t actually colonize the mouth or gut, so this result matches what science says. Some users wondered if the timing of sample collection missed a short-term effect, suggesting samples should be taken right after using the lozenge. A few shared their own experiences with probiotics, saying sometimes they notice benefits, but often not.

Several commenters liked how easy and affordable microbiome sequencing has become and thought it would be fun to try similar experiments themselves. Others were more skeptical of probiotics in general, saying companies often make big claims that are hard to prove. Some discussed the natural swings in mouth bacteria, agreeing with the author that these changes can happen quickly for many reasons, including diet or even time of day. Lastly, a few users were interested in the increase of S. salivarius and thought it might be worth studying further, while others felt the results were too unclear to say anything certain.

## Comparing AI agents to cybersecurity professionals in real-world pen testing

- 原文链接: [Comparing AI agents to cybersecurity professionals in real-world pen testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09882)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46518996)

This article compares how AI agents and human cybersecurity experts do penetration testing on a real university network. The study puts ten human security pros against six AI agents, including a new one called ARTEMIS, to see who finds more security problems.

The test uses a network with about 8,000 computers and 12 subnets, making it a big and real-world environment. ARTEMIS is an AI agent system that can make its own prompts, use smaller helper agents, and automatically sort out which bugs are important. In the results, ARTEMIS did very well—it found nine real security problems and got second place overall. Only one human did better, so ARTEMIS beat nine out of ten human testers. Other AI agents, like Codex and CyAgent, did not do as well and usually lost to the humans.

A big plus for the AI is that it can check systems more quickly and in parallel, so it saves time and money. For example, ARTEMIS can work for about $18 per hour, but a human tester costs about $60 per hour. However, AI agents are not perfect. They often say there is a problem when there is none (false positives) and have trouble with tasks that need to use a computer’s graphical interface.

In the Hacker News comments, some people are excited by how well ARTEMIS did, saying this could change how companies do security checks. Others worry about the false positives and say real humans are still needed to check results and do tricky testing. A few users think the low cost of AI is a big deal, especially for small companies that cannot hire expensive experts. Some people note that AI can miss creative attacks that only humans think of, so it is not a full replacement. Others are hopeful that AI will get better, and soon it might catch up with the best human testers. One commenter stresses that AI is fast but may not understand the bigger picture or context. Another points out that AI can help humans do their jobs faster, instead of replacing them. Some say this is just the start, and we will see more teamwork between humans and AI in security. A few are worried about AI being used for bad purposes, too, like hacking. Lastly, some commenters want to see these tests on even bigger or more complex networks before making final judgments.

## Calling All Hackers: How money works (2024)

- 原文链接: [Calling All Hackers: How money works (2024)](https://phrack.org/issues/71/17)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46518129)

This article is about how hackers can learn from the world of money, startups, and business, not just from computers. The author shares personal stories from being both a hacker and a startup founder, explaining how these worlds connect and what lessons hackers can use.

The main point is that being a hacker is about understanding how things work, not just in tech, but everywhere—like how markets move, how money flows, and how companies are run. The author explains how “shitcoins” (bad crypto tokens) are created and pumped for profit, showing how the system is set up so insiders win and regular people often lose. There are two styles: the “Asian Arrangement,” which is a classic pump-and-dump, and the “Western Way,” which tries to look cleaner but is often the same at heart. The article shows that most of these tokens have no real value, only hype.

The author then explains how basic finance works—especially bonds and the idea of borrowing and lending money. They describe how interest rates affect the whole system. When rates are low, investors take more risks and throw money at startups, even bad ones, because there isn’t much to lose. This is why, for a while, companies like Uber could spend a lot to get customers, even if they weren’t making money.

Stocks are explained as a mix of real value (from the business) and hype (what people hope will happen). Buybacks are mentioned as a way companies return value to shareholders, sometimes making stocks act a bit like tokens, pumped by stories and marketing. The author points out how the people most affected by a company’s choices are employees and customers, not shareholders, even though shareholders have the most power in the public markets because they can buy and sell quickly.

In the startup world, the article says venture capital (VC) is all about big, risky bets. VCs only care about huge wins, so they push founders to take wild risks, sometimes hurting good companies in the process. Founders are told to be “cult leaders” and hype their company, because narrative creates value—sometimes more than the business itself. This can be hard on founders and employees, especially young ones who don’t have much life experience yet. The author warns that chasing VC money can twist a company away from its real purpose.

The takeaway is that hackers should not feel powerless. The author believes building good companies and helping friends is real impact, more than any single hack. Hackers should try to understand how financial systems work, and use that knowledge to make things better, not just for profit. Don’t fall for the idea that everything is hopeless—learning how money and markets work gives you power to change things. It’s okay for hackers to raise money if they keep their values and don’t let investors take over. Bootstrapping is good, and “valuation” is just a number—real success is about helping people and doing good work.

In the comments, many readers say the article is eye-opening and honest about the flaws in crypto and VC. Some agree with the criticism of “shitcoins” and say the whole crypto world is full of scams and hype, just like the author says. Others point out that not all VCs are bad; some do support founders for the long term. A few say it’s important for hackers to learn about business, or else they’ll always be used by people who do. There’s some debate over whether it’s really possible to build a good company without outside investors—some say you have to take their money to grow, others warn that it’s better to stay independent.

Some readers like the message that hackers should run companies their own way, giving employees ownership and focusing on real value, not hype. Others feel sad that hacker culture is being “taken” by big security companies, but they also agree that the hacker mindset is more important than labels. A few share personal stories about startup struggles, agreeing with the author’s point that being a founder is hard and can take over your life. There are also comments about how interest rates and financial cycles affect everyone, even if you don’t follow the stock market.

Overall, readers appreciate the mix of hacking, business, and life lessons. Some say it’s rare to see this kind of honest talk in tech. Others are inspired to learn more about finance, so they can stop being “low agency” and start shaping the world themselves.

## Locating a Photo of a Vehicle in 30 Seconds with GeoSpy

- 原文链接: [Locating a Photo of a Vehicle in 30 Seconds with GeoSpy](https://geospy.ai/blog/locating-a-photo-of-a-vehicle-in-30-seconds-with-geospy)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46515948)

This article talks about a new AI tool called GeoSpy that helps find where a photo of a car was taken, sometimes in less than 30 seconds. The tool is made to help police and investigators quickly find stolen vehicles and other important locations using only photos.

The old way of finding stolen vehicles used things like cameras, witnesses, or GPS, but these methods were slow and didn’t always work. GeoSpy uses AI to look at photos and guess where they were taken, starting with guesses that are close (like city or country) and then getting very exact—down to just a few feet. The first version of GeoSpy could only guess within a few miles, but now, with their new AI model called SuperBolt, it can be as close as one meter.

The article explains two ways this works: geoestimation and geomatching. Geoestimation looks at things in the photo—like buildings or plants—to guess the place, but it can only get you to a city or country. Geomatching is more exact. It compares the photo to a huge database of other pictures that already have locations. If the photo matches one in the database, GeoSpy can tell you the exact spot. To make this work, the team had to collect millions of pictures and make their system very fast and able to find matches even with blurry or dark photos.

The tools in GeoSpy can work together: first, the estimation tool finds the general area, and then the matching tool finds the exact spot. This saves a lot of time and helps police act quickly. The system works even if the photo is not very good, and it can help find stolen cars being sold online, check if a photo is real, or even find places where stolen cars are kept.

For example, if someone posts a stolen car on Craigslist, GeoSpy can check the photo and find the real location—even if the seller tries to lie about where the car is. This can help police recover the car before it is sold to someone else. The article says this technology is changing how police work, making it much faster and better.

In the Hacker News comments, some people are impressed by how fast and accurate this system is. They like that it can help police and can be used to solve crimes more quickly. Others worry about privacy, asking if this technology could be used by people with bad intentions, or if it could make it easier to track people without their knowledge. Some users discuss the size and cost of keeping such a big image database, and if smaller groups or cities could use it too. A few think about ways people might try to fool the system, like taking photos at night or hiding landmarks, and ask how well GeoSpy works in those cases.

Other commenters wonder about mistakes—what if the system points to the wrong place? They say human investigators should double-check the results. Some are excited to try the tool for other uses, like checking where vacation photos were taken or finding cool places in old family pictures. Lastly, some developers talk about the technical side, sharing ideas for making the tool even faster or more accurate in the future.

## Show HN: Mantic.sh – A structural code search engine for AI agents

- 原文链接: [Show HN: Mantic.sh – A structural code search engine for AI agents](https://github.com/marcoaapfortes/Mantic.sh)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46512182)

Mantic.sh is a new code search tool made for AI agents to find code fast. It helps AI tools get the right code context without reading every file or using complex databases.

The main idea is speed and privacy. Mantic.sh runs on your own computer, not in the cloud. It can look through huge code projects in under half a second—much faster than many other tools. It does this by looking at file names, folder paths, and metadata, not by reading all the code. For example, if you search “stripe payment integration,” it will quickly find files with “stripe” or “payment” in high-signal folders like “features/payments.” It boosts important files (like services), lowers the rank of boilerplate (like index.ts), and uses git to look at tracked files only. You can search just code, config, or test files. You can also ask it to show how code changes might affect other parts of the app. It comes with options to limit search time and file count, as well as to ignore certain files. There’s no setup needed for most projects, and you can use it from the command line or inside editors like VS Code or Cursor. For teams, Mantic is free and private, while other tools can cost thousands per year and send data to the cloud.

People on Hacker News are excited about the speed and local-first approach. Many say searching big codebases is slow with other tools, so Mantic’s sub-500ms results are impressive. Some like that it does not need API keys or special databases. A few users are happy it works well with AI tools like Claude or Cursor, making AI coding smoother. There are questions about how well it finds files with odd names, or how it compares with smarter, embedding-based searches for fuzzy queries. Some worry about AGPL licensing if used in a commercial product, while others are glad it’s free for open source and private use. A few users suggest more editor plugins and documentation. Others debate if “intent” can really be found just from file structure, but most agree it’s a great step for developers who want fast, private code search.

## High-Performance DBMSs with io_uring: When and How to use it

- 原文链接: [High-Performance DBMSs with io_uring: When and How to use it](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04859)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46517319)

This article looks at how database systems can use a new Linux tool called io_uring to make input and output (I/O) faster and more efficient. The authors study io_uring in real database workloads and share when it helps most and how to use it well.

io_uring is a new way for programs to talk to storage and network devices without waiting, which can speed up things like saving or moving data. The paper explains that just swapping old I/O code for io_uring does not always make things faster. The team tests io_uring in two main cases: first, as part of a database’s buffer manager (which moves data between memory and storage), and second, for shuffling data over networks in big data jobs. They try out some advanced features, like registered buffers (which help avoid copying data) and passthrough I/O (which can skip some steps for speed). Sometimes, these tricks help a lot, but not everywhere. The authors find that to really get the speed boost, you need to change more than just the I/O calls—sometimes, you need to change the whole way the system works with data. They end by giving tips for building fast I/O systems and show how their ideas helped PostgreSQL (a popular database) run 14% faster when using io_uring.

In the comments, some people are excited about io_uring and think it is the future for high-speed servers. Others point out that it is still new and can be hard to use right, warning about bugs and tricky parts. A few users share stories about trying io_uring themselves and finding mixed results—sometimes it’s much faster, sometimes it makes no difference, or even slows things down. One person says that database workloads are special, and not all apps will see the same speedup. Another notes that Linux still changes io_uring a lot, so it can be hard to keep up. Some folks talk about how registered buffers are great in theory, but need careful planning to avoid memory waste. A few debate if all this work is worth it, since most users do not need super-fast I/O. Finally, there is agreement that for big, busy databases, io_uring has real promise, but using it well takes skill and careful design.

## Opus 4.5 is not the normal AI agent experience that I have had thus far

- 原文链接: [Opus 4.5 is not the normal AI agent experience that I have had thus far](https://burkeholland.github.io/posts/opus-4-5-change-everything/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46515696)

This article talks about Opus 4.5, a new AI coding agent, and how it changes software development. The writer used to think AI agents were helpful but not good enough to replace developers, but now he thinks Opus 4.5 might actually do it.

He says most AI agents used to write bad code and often made mistakes, which took a lot of time to fix. Opus 4.5, though, is different. It builds working software on the first try, and when it finds errors, it fixes them by itself. For example, he made a Windows tool to convert images, a video and GIF recording app, and a Facebook posting app for his wife’s business, all with Opus 4.5. The AI even handled things like building websites, setting up GitHub Actions, and working with Firebase for backend tasks. In just a few hours, Opus 4.5 finished projects that took him months before. It even built an order tracking and routing app, replacing two paid apps his wife used.

The writer admits he doesn’t fully understand the code Opus 4.5 writes, especially in languages he doesn’t know, but the AI always finds and fixes problems. He talks about changing his coding style: he now writes code for AI to read, not humans. He uses prompts that tell the AI to make code simple, flat, and easy for another AI to change later. He also uses AI to review and refactor code, and to check for security issues, though he still worries about missing something important.

He feels both excited and sad—excited about building things fast, but sad that his skills as a developer may not be special anymore. In the end, he says we should accept AI and keep building, but be careful with security.

In the comments, many people are surprised by how powerful Opus 4.5 seems. Some are excited and want to try it themselves. Others are more careful, saying small apps are easier for AI but big projects with complex logic and teamwork are harder. Some doubt the long-term quality of code made by AI, worried about bugs, security, and if anyone can understand or maintain the code later. A few say writing code only for AI, not humans, could be risky—what if you want to change AIs or lose your code? There are also comments about the danger of not knowing what your app actually does, especially when it connects to things like Facebook or stores private data. Some think AI will replace some developer jobs, but not all, and that humans will still need to check, design, and guide projects. Others see this as a tool to help developers, not replace them, making it easier to build apps quickly. Overall, people are both amazed and worried—AI is moving fast, but there are many questions about trust, safety, and the future of software work.
