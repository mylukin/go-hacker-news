- 原文链接: [No More Shading Languages: Compiling C++ to Vulkan Shaders [pdf]](https://xol.io/random/vcc-paper.pdf)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44307892)

The article discusses a new approach to creating graphics shaders by compiling C++ code directly into Vulkan shaders, bypassing the need for traditional shading languages like GLSL and HLSL. This paper introduces a compiler called Vcc, which transforms C++ code into Vulkan-compatible SPIR-V shaders. The authors argue that traditional shading languages have limitations, such as lack of support for pointers and recursion, which restrict the flexibility and power of shader programs. By using C++ instead, they aim to offer more programmability and code reuse between CPU and GPU.

The Vcc compiler overcomes several technical challenges, including how to handle logical pointers and recursion, which are typically not supported in SPIR-V shaders. The team developed techniques like pointer normalization and memory emulation to address these issues. They also created a small C++ library, NASL, to mimic shading language features such as vector and matrix operations. The compiler shows competitive performance in benchmarks, especially in graphics applications like real-time path tracing, which indicates the potential of this approach to unify graphics and compute programming models.

In the Hacker News comments, users had mixed reactions. Some were excited about the potential for increased code flexibility and easier maintenance, as C++ is a familiar language with extensive features. However, others expressed concerns about the complexity and potential overhead introduced by translating C++ to SPIR-V, which might not be necessary for simpler shader tasks. There was also a discussion about the practicality of this approach in real-world applications, with some suggesting it could be more suitable for complex projects that require the advanced features of C++. Overall, the idea of using C++ for shaders received interest but also raised questions about performance trade-offs and the feasibility of widespread adoption.
