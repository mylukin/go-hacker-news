Hello everyone, this is the 2025-11-20 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have a busy lineup: new AI tools from Google and Kagi, upgrades in space rockets, privacy worries around data collection, updates in popular open source software, and more. Let’s get started.

First up, Google has launched Nano Banana Pro, a new image creation and editing AI from DeepMind based on Gemini 3 Pro. This tool is designed to help people make accurate and creative images for infographics, posters, and storyboards, and it can add readable text in many languages right inside the picture. Nano Banana Pro stands out by using real-world facts and better reasoning, making images that are helpful and up to date. You can turn notes into diagrams, visualize data, or even show real-time info like weather and sports. The model handles text very well, even for longer sentences, and supports translation for international users.

Nano Banana Pro can blend up to 14 images, keep the look of up to 5 people in a photo, and help with editing tasks like lighting, focus, and camera angles, along with high-resolution output in 2K and 4K. You get creative controls to pick and change any part of an image, making it good for both quick edits and complex designs. It is now available in the Gemini app, Google Ads, Workspace, and for developers through APIs and Google AI Studio.

To help people know when images are AI-made, every image from Nano Banana Pro is marked with SynthID, a hidden watermark. There’s also a visible watermark for free and Pro users, but Ultra subscribers and pro tools can remove it. You can upload an image to the Gemini app to check if it was made by Google AI.

On Hacker News, users are excited about the high image quality and strong multi-language text. Some worry about fake images and misinformation, but think SynthID and visible watermarks help. The creative tools get praise, but some feel the name “Nano Banana Pro” is strange and might make the model seem less serious. Developers like the API access, but want to know more about costs and limits. There’s also debate about the watermark system, with some not fully trusting it to stop misuse and wishing for more ways to check if an image is AI-generated. Some compare it to OpenAI and Adobe tools, saying competition and real-time info features make this release interesting. A few raise privacy concerns over data collection. Most agree Nano Banana Pro is a big step for image AI, but many want to see how it works in the real world.

Next, let’s talk about US Customs and Border Protection, or CBP. A new report shows CBP is using cameras and license plate readers to track cars across the US, not just near the borders. If someone’s driving looks “suspicious,” CBP might stop or question them, and sometimes even search or detain people just because the system flags their travel. This raises privacy concerns, as many people do not know they are being tracked. Some lawyers and civil rights groups say this is unfair and could target innocent people. CBP says the surveillance is needed for safety, but there’s little info on how someone gets marked as “suspicious.” Lawmakers and privacy advocates want more rules and oversight.

Hacker News users are split: some are worried about too much government surveillance, saying it’s bad to track people without reason, while others feel it helps stop crime and illegal border crossings. Some share personal stories of being stopped far from the border. There’s debate about the rules being too vague and technology making mistakes. Privacy is a big concern, with people saying it’s almost impossible to avoid being tracked now. Some users feel stronger rules and oversight are needed, while others argue that if you have nothing to hide, you shouldn’t worry. Many agree the system could be abused if there are not strong rules.

Moving to space, Blue Origin announced big upgrades to its New Glenn rocket. They are making the engines stronger—seven BE-4 engines on the lower stage now provide 4.5 million pounds of thrust, up from 3.9 million, and the upper stage BE-3U engines are also stronger. The upgrades mean better service for missions to low-Earth orbit, the Moon, or deeper space. Other changes include a reusable fairing, cheaper tanks, and a new heat shield to allow rockets to launch again faster.

Blue Origin is also building a larger rocket, the New Glenn 9x4, which can carry more than 70 metric tons to low-Earth orbit and more than 20 metric tons to the Moon. Both the new and old rockets will fly at the same time to give customers more options.

Hacker News comments show excitement at Blue Origin’s progress and the engine improvements, with some happy to see competition with SpaceX. Others are waiting for real flights before getting too excited, noting Blue Origin has had delays before. Reusing the fairing and being able to launch faster is seen as a big step, but some wonder if Blue Origin can really keep up with SpaceX. The larger rocket is seen as smart for the future, but there are worries about the company taking on too much. Many hope Blue Origin will help lower launch prices, but others want to see more flights before believing the hype. Overall, there’s both excitement and caution.

Now, let’s look at Kagi, which has released two new AI tools: Quick Assistant and Research Assistant. Quick Assistant gives fast, simple answers, while Research Assistant digs deeper for detailed and varied results. Both tools use different AI models depending on the task. Kagi says AI can make mistakes, so their tools focus on showing sources and letting users check the information themselves. You can use these assistants on Kagi’s website or with keywords like “!quick” or “!research” in the search bar. Quick Assistant is available to all users, while Research Assistant is for top-tier users and provides more thorough answers using web search, code running, image generation, and special APIs. Kagi benchmarks many AI models but says they’re not chasing the top scores anymore, focusing instead on what helps users in real life.

Hacker News users like the idea of AI tools that help but do not replace human thinking. Some praise Kagi for being honest about AI limits and not pushing features on everyone. Others question if the assistants are worth paying for, since similar tools exist for free. Privacy is a concern for some, who want to know where their search data goes. Many like the focus on citing sources for trust. There’s also debate about benchmarks and real-world usefulness, with some liking Kagi’s flexible use of models. Some hope Kagi keeps improving without losing sight of what people really need.

Next, good news for home lab users: Proxmox VE 9.1 now lets you run Docker container images directly, without needing extra virtual machines or tricky setups. Proxmox VE is an open-source virtualization tool popular for home labs and servers. Before, running Docker containers meant extra complexity. Now, you can pull Docker images and turn them into LXC containers right in Proxmox. It’s a “tech preview,” so some features are missing—like easy updates and a perfect console—but you can start, stop, and manage containers with less trouble.

To use it, update to Proxmox VE 9.1.1, pull a Docker image, and create a new container from it. The article shows examples using Mosquitto and Nginx images. On Hacker News, users are excited that Proxmox is now easier and more powerful for containers, removing the need for extra VMs. Others point out it’s still early and may not work for every use, especially advanced Docker features. Some wish for docker-compose support and better update tools, while others say security is better than running Docker directly on the host. Many note that for bigger projects or production, you might still need VMs or a dedicated Docker host. Overall, the community is interested and hopeful, but knows the feature is not perfect yet.

Moving on to DuckDB, which now supports database encryption “at rest.” This means your data is safe even if someone copies your database file. DuckDB uses AES-GCM-256 and AES-CTR-256 encryption methods. AES-GCM is safer, but AES-CTR is faster. The header is always unencrypted, but the rest—including blocks, logs, and temporary files—is encrypted if you enable it. You can create a new encrypted database or encrypt an old one by copying its data. There are SQL commands for this, and you can check which databases are encrypted with a query. DuckDB does not need outside libraries, but with the “httpfs” extension, it can use OpenSSL for faster encryption.

Tests show that encrypted DuckDB is almost as fast as unencrypted, especially with OpenSSL. On Hacker News, users are happy to see built-in encryption, calling it important for sharing data or using DuckDB in the cloud. Some note that while AES-GCM is strong, DuckDB’s encryption may not meet all strict rules, like those for banks. Comparisons with PostgreSQL and SQLite show DuckDB’s move as a win for open source. Key management is still up to users—if you lose your key, your data is lost. Some like that temporary files and logs are encrypted too, something often missed in other systems. Others ask about future plans for easier key storage and management, and want to know about possible security holes. Performance results are praised, but there are reminders to check for updates due to possible bugs in encryption code. Some also wonder about sharing keys for multi-user databases. Most users are positive and excited to try encryption in their own projects.

Next, there’s an article about a missing preliminary report from the NTSB on a UPS Boeing MD-11F plane crash. When users tried to access the report, they found only a “Page not found” error. The rest of the page was just navigation links and legal notices. In the comments, people are frustrated this happens too often with official documents. Some wonder if the report was removed on purpose, or if it’s just a technical mistake. A few suggest using the Internet Archive for old versions. Others say NTSB usually posts accident reports quickly, so this might be a technical problem. There are tips for finding official reports, and discussion about the importance of public access to safety reports. Some users joke about “Page not found” errors being common even on important government sites. There’s also curiosity about the MD-11, which is known as a tricky plane to fly. Finally, someone asks if anyone has a backup copy of the report.

Now to privacy news: Mozilla is ending its partnership with Onerep, a company that claims to remove your data from people-search sites. The reason is a conflict of interest—Onerep’s founder also owns and runs similar people-search and data broker sites, which many see as a problem for trust. Mozilla had offered a paid service called Monitor Plus, powered by Onerep, inside Firefox. After reports revealed Onerep’s founder owned other data broker companies, Mozilla said it would end the partnership, but it took over a year. Monitor Plus will fully shut down in December 2025, and unused subscription money will be refunded. Mozilla says it couldn’t find a new vendor that met its high privacy standards, so it will focus on its free data breach alert service and adding more privacy features to Firefox.

Hacker News users were surprised it took Mozilla so long to end the partnership. Some question if Mozilla kept working with Onerep because it was profitable. There’s discussion about how hard it is to trust privacy tools, especially if the people behind them have hidden interests. Some wonder why Mozilla didn’t spot the problem earlier, others defend Mozilla, saying it’s tough to find good partners. Some feel Mozilla should build these tools themselves to avoid such conflicts. Most agree that trust is key for privacy services, and this story is a lesson for companies to be more careful about their partners.

Next, let’s talk about GitHut, a website that shows which programming languages are most active on GitHub using public data and charts. The main page lists top languages like JavaScript, Java, Python, and CSS, and you can see activity over time. GitHut uses the number of code changes as the main way to measure activity, but this can undercount some languages, especially for big projects that don’t update often. The data is updated every few months, and everything is open for anyone to check or use.

In the comments, people like seeing language trends, but point out the way GitHub counts languages can be misleading, especially for projects with many files or mixed languages. Some note that older languages like C or C++ can be undercounted because big projects don’t always update. JavaScript’s high rank is seen as normal, since many web projects use it. There’s debate about whether GitHub is the best place to measure all programming, since not every developer uses GitHub, and private code isn’t counted. Some people like seeing newer languages like Go and Rust in the list. Others want more details about how activity is measured, and discuss ways to improve the site, like looking at stars, forks, or issues. Most people find GitHut useful, but see its limits.

Finally, LionsOS is a new operating system built on the seL4 microkernel, aiming to bring high security, speed, and reliability to more people. It is still in early development and not considered stable, but it’s open for anyone to try or help build. LionsOS is different from most OSes: it gives you small parts called components, which you put together using a tool called Microkit to make a system that fits your needs. Each component does just one job and talks to others using fast, lock-free queues. There’s a virtualiser to help manage how drivers talk to hardware. The system is static, so it doesn’t change itself while running, but you can swap out parts of the same type if needed. The team says LionsOS needs more components to be widely useful, and they welcome outside help.

Hacker News users are excited about the focus on security and reliability, and like the idea of building custom systems from small pieces. Some worry that a static system could be less flexible, and ask how it will handle changing hardware or updates. The learning curve is also a concern, since LionsOS is very different from Linux or Windows. A strong community and good documentation are seen as important for its success. Others mention the need for more drivers and hardware support. Some are hopeful that, with more contributors, LionsOS could become a good choice for secure devices, especially in embedded systems. There’s both excitement and caution about how LionsOS will grow and who will use it.

That’s all for today’s episode. We covered new AI tools, privacy and surveillance issues, open source updates, and new moves in space and operating systems. Thanks for listening to Hacker News Daily Podcast. See you next time.
