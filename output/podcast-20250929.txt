Hello everyone, this is the 2025-09-29 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we bring you four interesting stories from the world of tech, AI, and web design.

First, California’s governor has signed a new law called the Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act. This law is meant to make AI safer and more open, while still helping tech companies in California grow. The law says that companies making big new AI models must show the public how they follow safety rules and best practices, and put this information on their websites. It also creates a group called CalCompute to help with research and make sure AI is built in a way that is safe, fair, and good for everyone. If there is a serious problem with an AI system, companies and people can now report it to the state’s emergency office. Whistleblowers who see dangerous things in AI are protected, and companies that break the rules can be fined. The Department of Technology will look at the law every year and suggest changes if needed, so the rules can keep up with new tech. This law follows advice from AI experts and tries to fill the gap left by slow action from the federal government. California wants to balance new ideas with public safety and keep people’s trust in AI.

In the comments, some people are happy and say this law is a good first step for making AI safer. They like that it is clear, has real rules, and protects whistleblowers. Others think it could slow down companies or add too much paperwork, especially for small startups. Some say only very big companies will have to follow these rules, so it might not stop smaller, risky projects. A few worry the law is too simple and does not fix big AI problems. Some want more rules, while others worry too many laws could hurt innovation. There are also comments that California is right to act if the federal government is too slow. Many agree transparency is important, but some are unsure if companies will really share enough information. Overall, people are split: some feel hopeful, and others are cautious about what this law will really change.

Next, let’s talk about Claude Code 2.0, a new tool from Anthropic that helps software developers write code faster with AI, right from the terminal. You install it with npm and use the ‘claude’ command in your project folder. It also works in your IDE or by tagging @claude on Github. Claude Code can explain confusing code, help with routine tasks, and even manage git commands using simple, natural language. There’s built-in support for bug reporting—just type /bug to share issues or feedback. If you want to connect with other users, there is a Discord channel for Claude Code developers.

The team collects some feedback and usage data to improve the tool, like when you accept or reject suggestions, or send feedback. They promise to protect your data, keep sensitive information only for a short time, and not use your feedback to train their AI models. All policies and documents are linked for users who want details.

Hacker News users are excited about AI tools that run in the terminal, saying it fits into their workflows. Some like that Claude Code helps manage git and explain code, which are common pain points. Others are interested in how good the explanations are compared to OpenAI or GitHub Copilot. A few are cautious about sharing code with a cloud service and want to know more about privacy. One user reminds others not to send private or company code to third parties, even with safeguards. There’s talk about the trend of AI in developer tools—some say it’s the future, others worry about over-reliance. Some ask if Claude Code works offline, but it needs the internet. A few question if Claude can handle large codebases or real-world projects, and suggest trying it on open source code first. Many are happy to see more competition in this space and hope it pushes all the tools to get better.

The third story is about Loadmo.re, a website that shows creative and unusual designs for mobile websites. Its goal is to give designers ideas for making better mobile-first web experiences. Loadmo.re has a gallery of more than 360 mobile sites, each with unique design ideas. The creators believe most designers still work on computers, but most users now browse on phones, which creates a gap. Loadmo.re tries to close that gap by showing examples made just for mobile screens. The website lets people filter by tags and look through different pages for inspiration. There’s also a link to Instagram for updates and an invite for users to submit their own sites. The main idea is to start more conversations about mobile-first design.

In the comments, many people say they like the idea of focusing on mobile design inspiration. Some designers mention it’s hard to find good mobile examples, so this site is helpful. Others point out that most design tools are for desktop, making it tough to create truly mobile-first websites. A few worry that fancy designs might hurt usability or slow down sites. Some share their favorite mobile sites or tools. Others ask if Loadmo.re plans to show how well these designs work in real life, not just how they look. There are comments about trends—some want more simple, fast designs, while others enjoy seeing wild, experimental ideas. A few ask for more tags or better ways to search, and some wish the site itself was even faster and more mobile-friendly. Overall, the feedback is positive, with many hoping the site keeps growing and helps push mobile web design forward.

Finally, OpenAI now lets people buy things inside ChatGPT using a new tool called Instant Checkout. This works first with Etsy sellers in the U.S., and will soon include more shops from Shopify. The main idea is to let users find and buy products without leaving the chat. Instant Checkout is powered by the Agentic Commerce Protocol, made by OpenAI with Stripe and other partners. The protocol is open-source, so any shop can connect with AI agents. For users, you just ask ChatGPT for something to buy, see results, tap "Buy," check your details, and finish the purchase—all in the chat. ChatGPT does not change prices or push certain products. For sellers, Instant Checkout is a new way to reach buyers, and they keep full control of payments and support. Merchants pay a small fee per sale, but users don’t pay extra, and payments are handled by the seller’s own system.

OpenAI says this is made for trust. Users confirm every step, payments are safe, and only needed data is shared. The hope is this will start new ways to shop using AI.

In the comments, some are excited about buying things right in ChatGPT, saying it could make shopping easier and faster. A few worry about privacy, asking what data is shared and how safe it is. Some developers like that the protocol is open-source and easy for shops to add, but others wonder if small shops can keep up. A few users question if ChatGPT will favor certain sellers, even if OpenAI says results are not paid or promoted. Others point out this could lead to more impulse buying, since it’s so simple and quick. Some hope this will push other chatbots or AI tools to add shopping features too. One commenter thinks the real power is the protocol itself, which could be used for other tasks. Others are unsure if people want to buy things this way, instead of using web shops. Some are curious about returns and support if the sale starts inside ChatGPT, and a few worry about scams. Overall, the comments show a mix of excitement, curiosity, and some concerns about privacy and safety.

That’s all for today’s episode. Thanks for listening to Hacker News Daily Podcast. We’ll be back tomorrow with more news and ideas from the tech world.
