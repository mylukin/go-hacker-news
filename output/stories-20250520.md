- 原文链接: [A shower thought turned into a Collatz visualization](https://abstractnonsense.com/collatz/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44036716)

A person had a creative idea during a shower to visualize the Collatz Conjecture. This mathematical problem involves a simple rule for numbers: if a number is even, divide it by 2; if odd, multiply by 3 and add 1. The challenge is to show this process always leads to 1, and no one has proven it for all numbers yet. The idea was to visualize the sequence of these steps for many numbers at once, using binary digits, which was then plotted into an interactive graph.

The article shares a JavaScript implementation of the visualization. It uses a "shortcut" method that immediately divides by 2 after the 3n + 1 step for odd numbers. The plot shows these sequences as binary fractions, revealing a structure that seems almost random. However, when plotting pairs of these fractions, a surprising pattern emerges that looks like a language or code. This discovery is similar to findings in a 2019 paper by a French mathematician, which the author stumbled upon using advanced search tools.

In the comments, one person noted the distribution in the visualization doesn't seem truly uniform, sparking a debate about what "uniform" means in this context. Another commenter related the visualization to patterns seen in random number generation, suggesting a link to randomness. Some people also discussed the practicality of having showers at work, with mixed opinions on whether it's weird or brilliant. Lastly, a few commenters appreciated the unique way of visualizing the Collatz Conjecture, noting how it reveals interesting structural patterns.
