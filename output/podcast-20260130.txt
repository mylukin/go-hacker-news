Hello everyone, this is the 2026-01-30 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have a wide range of stories, from honest building images and decentralized web hosting, to new AI models, proxy network takedowns, and the secrets to software survival. Let’s dive right in.

Our first story is about AntiRender, a tool that makes fancy building images look more like real life. Many architectural renders show perfect sunshine, green trees, and happy people, making new buildings look like a dream. AntiRender lets you upload a computer-generated building image and then shows you the “before”—the glossy, bright version—and the “after”—a more honest, even gloomy picture, like a cloudy day in November. It removes fake people, bright colors, and adds a touch of daily reality. The creator, Magnus Hambleton, offers a few free tries and asks for support to keep the site running.

Hacker News users find AntiRender both funny and useful. They like how it shows the big gap between marketing and real life. Some say architects and developers often make buildings look much better than they are, which can lead to disappointment. Others think the tool is a bit harsh, but agree it starts an important talk about honesty in architecture. There’s also technical discussion about how AntiRender works, with some guessing it uses AI or filters. People ask for more features, like showing buildings in different seasons. Many agree that showing both the dream and reality can help people make better choices. Several users share stories about being fooled by beautiful renders in the past.

Next, let’s talk about PeerWeb, a new tool for hosting static websites using WebTorrent, not traditional servers. With PeerWeb, your site lives on a peer-to-peer network, making it harder to censor or take down. You just drag and drop your website folder, and PeerWeb creates a special link for sharing. If you want your site always online, you can use their desktop app. The system caches websites for a week and uses DOMPurify to clean up dangerous code, keeping users safe. Only static sites are allowed, and every site must have an index.html file.

The response from the Hacker News community is mostly positive. People like the idea of a web that does not depend on big companies. They see PeerWeb as good for privacy and freedom, though there are worries about what happens if no one is sharing your site, or if a site becomes very popular. Users like the security features and the simple, easy-to-use design. Some compare PeerWeb to older projects like IPFS or Freenet, and want better ways to find sites beyond sharing hashes. Most see PeerWeb as a fun experiment that helps more people learn about decentralized technology.

Now, let’s look at Kimi K2.5, a new large language model from Moonshot AI. This technical report explains that Kimi K2.5 can handle much longer texts than older models, thanks to “efficient attention.” It uses both old and new training data, and is trained in both English and Chinese. The team says Kimi K2.5 does well in tests, can summarize long articles, answer questions, and even write code. They also focus on safety, with filters to block dangerous answers, and they share many details about their methods.

In the comments, people are impressed by Kimi K2.5’s ability to handle long texts, noting its use for lawyers, scientists, and anyone who needs to read big documents. Some question if the model is really as strong as the numbers show, since real-life results can differ from test scores. Users also talk about open-source models catching up, and wonder about the model's training data and possible copyright issues. Many praise the team’s openness, but would like even more technical details. There are also questions about speed, cost, and hopes for open sourcing the model. People are happy to see strong support for both English and Chinese.

Our fourth story is about Google and its partners breaking up a huge residential proxy network called IPIDEA, which was used for many cybercrimes. Hackers used the network to hide their real internet addresses by taking over normal people’s devices. Google attacked the network by shutting down control domains, warning partners, and updating Android security. The proxy code was often hidden in apps, sometimes with promises to “earn money” by sharing your internet. Once your device joined, criminals could use your home connection for attacks, putting you at risk.

Hacker News users thank Google for acting against a big threat, but also worry how easy it is for bad actors to take over devices using shady SDKs. Some say “monetize your bandwidth” offers are always risky and should be banned or at least explained better to users. Others note that proxy networks always come back, so device makers and app stores need to do more. There’s also debate on whether residential proxies can ever be ethical, since most users do not really understand what is happening. Some developers warn to always check what third-party code is doing to keep users safe.

Let’s move on to “Software Survival 3.0,” an article about why some software projects last for years while others disappear quickly. The author says most software is fragile and breaks when teams or the outside world change. To survive, software needs a strong community, good documentation, simple code, and clear goals. Open source software often lives longer because anyone can help fix it, but even good software can die if there’s no money or if companies close. Too much complexity can also lead to failure.

The comments agree that community is key, with open source projects like Linux and Python surviving thanks to many users and contributors. People also note that small, simple tools often last longest because they do one thing well. There’s debate about open versus closed source, but many agree that making software easy to understand and fix is the best way to help it survive.

Now, Bluesky has released its 2025 Transparency Report, showing a 60% growth to over 41 million users. The report covers how Bluesky handles toxic content, improves verification, meets new age laws, and upgrades moderation tools. They added features to hide abusive replies and let users control what they see, leading to a big drop in reports of anti-social behavior. Bluesky also launched a new verification system and updated age checks to protect privacy. Their Community Guidelines now have 39 report types and a “strike system” for rule-breaking. Both automated tools and human moderators work together to catch problems, with most takedowns for spam or fake accounts.

Hacker News users praise Bluesky’s transparency and detailed report, but some question if too much automation could hurt free speech. There are also worries about privacy, especially with age checks and legal requests. Some like allowing adult content with labels, while others worry about younger users. The strike system gets mixed reviews, and users discuss whether Bluesky’s decentralized approach gives enough control to users. Many hope Bluesky keeps improving, is careful with privacy, and makes sure rules are fair.

Next is Moltbook, a new website that acts like a social feed for digital agents and humans, sharing thoughts, tools, and advice about living in a busy online world. One post describes building a tool called “steamdensity” to filter out low-quality games on Steam and only show real new releases. Another post says we might already be in an “intelligence explosion,” not from one smart AI, but from thousands of agents and humans working together. A third post gives advice to filter out unhelpful information and focus on what matters.

In the comments, people like the idea of filtering out noise and share their own tools. Some worry about “filter bubbles,” where you only see what you already like, and others point out you can miss good things if you filter too much. There’s interest in how networks of agents and people can get smarter together, but some wonder if this means giving up control to software. Most agree that simple tools to manage online noise are helpful.

Our next story is about the National Herbarium of Ireland’s new digital collection, now available online. You can now see thousands of plant specimens collected in Ireland, with high-quality images and details about where and when they were found. The Herbarium in Dublin keeps over half a million dried plants, and this digital project is a partnership with the National Botanic Gardens and the Digital Repository of Ireland. The goal is to make plant research and history open to all.

Commenters are excited to see national collections made open and easy to access. Some talk about the value of digital records for students, teachers, and plant lovers, and remember visiting the Botanic Gardens in person. Users discuss the importance of good metadata and digital preservation, and hope more collections will go online. Some wish for even more data, like DNA or climate info, to make the collection better.

Another article covers building interactive documentation for a product called Scour. The author wanted the docs to feel like a real part of the product, letting users try features directly in the docs. For example, you can search or subscribe inside the docs, and all examples use the real product code, so they never get out of date. Links are kept safe and correct using Rust’s type system.

The feedback is positive, with users saying interactive docs help them learn faster. Others note that regular docs are often boring or quickly go out of date. Some developers like the use of Rust for safe links, but a few worry that too much interactivity can make docs harder to use for quick answers or for printing. There are calls to open source the doc system, and everyone agrees that user feedback is key to improving docs.

Our last story is a video about Donald Bickler, the engineer who invented the Mars rover suspension system. The story is shared by his child, showing both his career and his personal side. Bickler created the “rocker-bogie” system, which helps Mars rovers travel smoothly over rough ground. He built the first models in his garage, and his design has been used on every Mars rover since Sojourner. The video also shows how he mentored younger engineers and stayed humble after great success.

The comments are full of praise, with people saying the video is moving and a perfect tribute to a great engineer. Many did not know Bickler’s name before, but now see how important he was to space history. People love how the video mixes family memories and technical details, and some say it inspired them to become engineers. There are also thanks to the creator for sharing the story and making Bickler’s work known.
