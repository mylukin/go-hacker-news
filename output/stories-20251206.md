## Tiny Core Linux: a 23 MB Linux distro with graphical desktop

- 原文链接: [Tiny Core Linux: a 23 MB Linux distro with graphical desktop](http://www.tinycorelinux.net/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46173547)

Tiny Core Linux is a very small Linux system that gives you a working desktop with a download size of only 23 MB. It is made for people who want a fast, light, and easy-to-customize operating system.

The system starts with just the Linux kernel and the most basic files. You can add more parts, like a desktop, programs, or support for different hardware, by installing small packages called extensions. The Tiny Core version with a GUI uses FLTK and FLWM for its window system, and you get basic tools like a terminal and a simple app bar. If you want something even smaller, there is “Core,” which is only 11 MB and has no desktop. There’s also “CorePlus,” which lets you pick your own desktop and makes it easy to set up on USB drives or CDs.

Tiny Core Linux is not meant to be a full desktop system out of the box. It may not support all hardware, and you need to add the things you want yourself. The idea is to give you control, so you only install what you need. It is good for old computers, small servers, or making special devices. The whole system runs in RAM, so it boots very fast. You can put apps in RAM or on storage, and you can even build your own extensions if you want. The project is open and welcomes anyone to help or join the community.

In the comments, many people are surprised and impressed by how small Tiny Core Linux is. Some say it is great for old laptops or computers with little memory. Others like that it is so fast because it runs in RAM. A few users share stories of using Tiny Core for special projects, like simple servers or home automation.

Some commenters say it is not easy for beginners, because you have to set up many things by yourself. They note that you need to know a bit about Linux to use it well. Others compare Tiny Core to other small Linux distros and say it is one of the smallest, but maybe not the most user-friendly.

A few people ask about hardware support and if it works well with WiFi or special devices. Some answers say that you need to add drivers or use wired internet if your hardware is not supported out of the box. There are also tips in the comments about using Tiny Core for learning, testing, or even making your own version of Linux.

Overall, the comments show respect for the project, but also note that it is best for people who like to build things themselves, not for someone who wants everything to work right away. Some users love the control and the size, while others prefer bigger Linux systems that are easier to use.

## GrapheneOS is the only Android OS providing full security patches

- 原文链接: [GrapheneOS is the only Android OS providing full security patches](https://grapheneos.social/@GrapheneOS/115647408229616018)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46173407)

GrapheneOS says it is the only Android-based system that gives users all the latest security patches, sometimes months before others. They work hard to release security updates quickly, even before the official public release dates by Google.

Some patches, which should have come in December 2025, were made optional and pushed to later months, so they are not shown in the public Android security bulletin. Still, GrapheneOS includes these patches early in their own releases. Most phone companies, called OEMs, cannot keep up with this fast pace because they need more time to test and ship updates. That is why important security fixes are often delayed on other Android devices.

GrapheneOS staff say giving these early security patches is a lot of work. It takes a full-time developer and slows down the creation of new features. Also, they are working on moving servers and hiring more people to improve speed and organization.

Android security patches are usually sent back to older Android versions. Since GrapheneOS is based on Android 16 QPR1, they need to move patches from Android 16 to their own version. Soon, other devices besides Google Pixel may also get new Android versions with these updates.

GrapheneOS wishes Google would share security fixes with phone companies only one week ahead of time, not months. This way, everyone could get important patches faster, and hackers would have less time to find and use problems before they are fixed. They also say big companies should hire more people to close this gap.

In the comments, some users thank the GrapheneOS team for their hard work and say they plan to donate. A few people ask if this means GrapheneOS is less open, since some patches are not public until Google says so. The team explains they have the patch code but cannot share it until the official date. They work under agreements that let them use patches early but not make them public.

One comment says the process is confusing, but another user explains that security patches for March 2026 were already available in November 2025, showing how much faster GrapheneOS works. Some users wish for better update notifications across user profiles. A team member answers that there is a feature for forwarding notifications between profiles.

Other comments ask about support for new devices and how many people work at GrapheneOS. Some share positive experiences, like switching to GrapheneOS on a Pixel phone, saying the process is easy and they like the result. One user reports a bug when connecting their phone to a display, hoping it gets fixed. Overall, users seem thankful and supportive, praising the team’s focus on security and user choice.

## Zebra-Llama: Towards Efficient Hybrid Models

- 原文链接: [Zebra-Llama: Towards Efficient Hybrid Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17272)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46176289)

The article talks about Zebra-Llama, a new way to make large language models (LLMs) faster and use less memory. The authors show how to build hybrid models by mixing State Space Models (SSMs) and Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) layers, using old pre-trained transformers to help teach them.

Zebra-Llama comes in three sizes: 1B, 3B, and 8B parameters. The team found a way to train these models using much less data—only 7 to 11 billion tokens—compared to the trillions often needed. The models use a special training process to copy what the big transformer models know, but don’t need to start from scratch. Zebra-Llama models keep almost all the accuracy of regular transformer models but work much faster and need far less memory for the “KV cache” (down to as little as 2% of the original size). This makes them very good for devices with limited resources or for serving many users at once.

The authors compared Zebra-Llama to other models like MambaInLLaMA, X-EcoMLA, and Minitron. Zebra-Llama is often just as accurate, or even better, but uses less memory and less training data. For example, Zebra-Llama-8B beats Minitron-8B by 7% in few-shot tasks, while using eight times less training data. It also runs 2.6 to 3.8 times faster than some other models, even when dealing with long pieces of text. The team plans to release their code and model files soon.

In the Hacker News comments, some users are excited about the memory savings, saying this could help bring strong language models to phones or small devices. Others point out that reducing cache size helps run more users on the same hardware, which is great for companies offering AI services. A few people ask if accuracy really stays the same and want to see more real-world tests, not just benchmarks. Some are curious about the hybrid approach: they wonder if mixing SSM and attention layers could become the new normal for LLMs. There are also questions about how easy it is to retrain these models for special uses, and if this method can help older models stay useful for longer. A few users are cautious, noting that every new “efficient” model comes with trade-offs, and want to see the open-source code before making any big claims. Overall, the community is interested and hopeful, but they want proof that Zebra-Llama works well outside the lab.

- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46175826)

Georgia Tech is sharing its Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) course content with the public for free. The open courseware site lists many graduate-level computer science courses, each with links to lecture videos and exercises. You can find topics like operating systems, artificial intelligence, machine learning, databases, computer vision, and more. The content is the same as what enrolled OMSCS students use, but it does not include graded homework, projects, exams, or quizzes. If you are a real OMSCS student, you should use the official student portal for up-to-date material and grades.

Anyone can browse and learn from these courses, making it a good resource for self-study or review. The site uses Ed Lessons for hosting the materials. Some courses have extra community forums or discussion groups, but these may not be as active as in the real classes. The open courseware covers a wide range of technical skills, from beginner to advanced, and includes modern topics like deep learning, reinforcement learning, and quantum computing.

In the Hacker News comments, many people are excited to see high-quality graduate CS material available for free. Some users say this could help people who cannot afford a full master’s program or who only want to learn certain topics. Others mention that while videos are helpful, real learning often comes from doing the assignments and projects, which are not included here. A few commenters wish more schools would offer similar resources, and some compare this to MIT OpenCourseWare and Coursera.

Some users discuss how open content can help with career changes or skill upgrades. Others point out that without accreditation or feedback, it may be harder to prove your knowledge from these materials. One person notes that the lack of homework solutions might make self-study challenging. Some wonder if this could reduce the value of a paid degree, while others think it increases the reputation of Georgia Tech by sharing knowledge freely. A few people ask if there are ways to get certificates or proof of completion, but so far, there is not. Overall, most commenters support the idea and hope the content stays available and grows over time.

## Z-Image: Powerful and highly efficient image generation model with 6B parameters

- 原文链接: [Z-Image: Powerful and highly efficient image generation model with 6B parameters](https://github.com/Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46095817)

This article is about Z-Image, a new and efficient image generation model with 6 billion parameters, released as open-source on GitHub. The model comes in three versions: Z-Image-Turbo for fast generation, Z-Image-Base for future fine-tuning, and Z-Image-Edit for editing images using text instructions.

The main feature of Z-Image-Turbo is its ability to create high-quality, photorealistic images in less than one second on powerful GPUs, and it can even run on regular consumer devices with just 16GB of VRAM. It is especially good at showing Chinese and English text clearly in images, and it can follow instructions in both languages. Z-Image-Edit lets users make detailed and creative changes to images using natural language prompts.

The model uses a special architecture called Scalable Single-Stream DiT. This setup combines text and image information into one stream, making the model more efficient than other systems that split the information into two streams. For fast image generation, Z-Image-Turbo uses only 8 steps, which is much fewer than many other models.

To speed up and improve the quality of image generation, the creators use new training methods called Decoupled-DMD and DMDR. Decoupled-DMD splits the training process into two parts: one for guiding the generation (CFG Augmentation) and one for checking the output quality (Distribution Matching). DMDR then adds reinforcement learning to further improve results, making images look better and match prompts more closely.

Z-Image-Turbo already works with popular tools like HuggingFace Diffusers and can be used with just a few commands. There are community projects that help run Z-Image on devices with less memory, like 4GB VRAM, and tools that make it even faster.

According to tests where humans pick their favorite images, Z-Image-Turbo performs as well as or better than many other leading open-source models.

In the Hacker News comments, some users are impressed with how fast and efficient the model is, especially on consumer hardware. Others point out that clear bilingual text rendering is rare and useful, since most models struggle with non-English text. A few commenters discuss the technical details, like the single-stream architecture, and note that it might be a smart way to save memory and computation.

Some developers are interested in the open-source aspect and want to try fine-tuning the base model for their own projects once it’s released. Others ask about the quality of images compared to well-known models like Stable Diffusion or Midjourney, and some share their own results after testing the model, saying the images look sharp and realistic.

There are also questions about licensing and whether the model can be used for commercial projects. A few users express concerns about the environmental cost of training such large models, while others appreciate the community focus and contributions from other projects to make the model more accessible. Some debate if the real-world usefulness of fast image generation is worth the complexity, while others are excited about using Z-Image for text-heavy graphics or creative editing tasks.

## HTML as an Accessible Format for Papers

- 原文链接: [HTML as an Accessible Format for Papers](https://info.arxiv.org/about/accessible_HTML.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46173825)

arXiv now offers research papers in HTML format, not just PDF. This change aims to make papers easier to read for everyone, especially people with disabilities.

Most arXiv papers are written in LaTeX, which is hard to turn into HTML. HTML is better for screen readers, mobile devices, and people who need bigger text. arXiv is slowly adding HTML for its huge library, but not every paper can be converted right now. Authors can check how their paper looks in HTML before publishing. The project is still in beta, so errors and layout problems will happen.

arXiv wants users to report issues with HTML papers, but only if something important is wrong—like if text can't be read or the layout is broken. It’s normal for HTML to look different from PDF; for example, the lines might break in new places and the pages may look less neat. HTML’s main purpose here is function, not perfect formatting. The real benefit is that HTML works better with assistive technology and on phones.

Authors can help by following best practices for writing LaTeX. Developers can join in to improve the conversion tools. Publishers and conference organizers can help by checking the templates they recommend to authors, making sure they use supported LaTeX packages.

arXiv thanks scientists with disabilities for their help, and acknowledges the LaTeX Project and LaTeXML team for their big role in making this possible.

In the Hacker News comments, many users praise arXiv for focusing on accessibility. Some say HTML is easier to read on phones and tablets, and helps people who use screen readers. Others mention that converting LaTeX to good HTML is very hard, so it’s okay if things are not perfect at first. A few users worry about losing special formatting or graphics in the conversion. Some suggest that open tools and community feedback will help fix problems faster. Others point out that academic publishing often ignores accessibility, so this is a big step forward. Some users hope more sites will follow this example, while a few still prefer PDFs for offline reading or printing. Overall, most people see this as a positive move, even if there will be some bumps along the way.

## Abstract Interpretation in the Toy Optimizer

- 原文链接: [Abstract Interpretation in the Toy Optimizer](https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/toy-abstract-interpretation/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46142949)

This article explains how abstract interpretation works in a small toy optimizer used for compiler experiments. The author starts by showing how to use abstract interpretation to reason about program behavior without running the program, focusing on a simple intermediate representation (IR) in "single static assignment" form.

Abstract interpretation uses "abstract values" instead of real ones; for example, instead of knowing the exact number, you might only know if it is positive or negative. The article gives an example where two variables are added, and the system can tell if the result is positive, negative, or unknown (called "top" in the lattice). Transfer functions are used to update the abstract value after each operation. The author explains that the more you know about the values, the more you can optimize the program, such as removing checks that are always true or false.

The post then moves to "parity" analysis, which tracks if a number is even or odd. The author describes the structure in Python and shows how to analyze a block of code, updating the parity after each operation. They give examples: shifting a number left by one always makes it even, and adding two even numbers stays even. Using this, you can optimize away certain checks in the code, like replacing a bitwise AND with a constant when the result is always even or odd.

The article outlines how the optimizer tries to simplify instructions in a single pass. If it knows the result of a "bitand" operation, it can replace it with the right constant. This approach is inspired by PyPy's real-world optimizer. The author also mentions other types of abstract domains—like constant propagation and range analysis—that can be used for deeper optimizations.

In the Hacker News comments, many readers praise the clear step-by-step explanation and say it helps demystify abstract interpretation, which is often seen as too abstract or mathematical. Some users share how they have used similar techniques in real-world compilers, like LLVM or for static analysis tools. Others point out that simple lattices, like parity or positivity, are easy to explain but not very powerful in practice; more advanced domains can be both tricky and expensive to compute.

One commenter notes that the article’s focus on toy examples is helpful for learning, but real-world IRs are more complex because of loops and control flow, which need further analysis steps. A few readers discuss how adding more elements to the lattice (like tracking ranges or known bits) can make the analysis more precise, but also makes the code harder to write and maintain.

Some developers mention that tools like PyPy, LLVM, and even the Linux kernel use similar ideas for optimization and bug finding, and they appreciate the links to actual code in open-source projects. There’s also debate about whether abstract interpretation is the best method for all analyses, or if other techniques (like symbolic execution) might be better in some cases.

A couple of comments ask for more direct code examples or wish for a video walk-through. Others thank the author for clear explanations and hope for further posts on more complex abstract interpretation topics, like handling control flow or proving correctness of the analysis.

## Autism's confusing cousins

- 原文链接: [Autism's confusing cousins](https://www.psychiatrymargins.com/p/autisms-confusing-cousins)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46172443)

This article talks about why many people today think they have autism, even if they might have other conditions. The writer is a psychiatrist who often meets patients who believe they are autistic, but their symptoms may fit better with other mental health conditions.

The article explains that people might identify with autism because it is well-known and often discussed, while other similar disorders are less familiar. Sometimes, people struggle with eye contact, feel awkward in social situations, dislike small talk, have strict routines, or focus deeply on hobbies. These traits could be signs of autism, but they can also appear in anxiety disorders, personality disorders, or trauma.

The writer describes the official criteria for diagnosing autism: difficulties in social communication and interaction, plus repetitive behaviors or strong interests, starting in early childhood and causing real problems in life. Autism is not found through medical tests; it’s a judgment based on patterns of behavior. There is no single gene or brain scan that proves autism.

Many conditions can look like autism. Schizoid personality means someone prefers to be alone because they do not enjoy relationships, not because they find social cues hard. Schizotypal personality involves odd beliefs and magical thinking, along with social anxiety. Obsessive-compulsive personality is about being rigid and needing control, but for reasons different from autism. Social anxiety disorder involves fear of being judged, which can make someone seem withdrawn. Borderline personality disorder brings unstable emotions and relationships, which can overlap with some autism-like behaviors.

There is also social communication disorder, which is trouble using language in social ways, but without the repetitive behaviors of autism. Trauma, especially early in life, can cause behaviors that look like autism, such as avoiding eye contact or needing routines for safety. Some people are simply socially awkward, which is normal and not a disorder. Many other conditions—like ADHD, generalized anxiety, or intellectual disability—can have similar features.

The article notes that autism is often diagnosed instead of these other conditions because it is more recognized, has more support and services, and people know about it more. This means some people may get an autism label when another diagnosis would be more accurate.

In the comments, some readers share that they or people they know were misdiagnosed with autism when they really had anxiety or trauma. Others say the wide range of autism makes it hard to tell who is truly autistic. Some believe social awkwardness is now seen as a problem when it used to be just a personality trait.

A few point out that the rise of self-diagnosis online, especially on social media, makes things more confusing. Some worry that resources for people with severe autism might get stretched thin if too many people are labeled as autistic. Others note that getting a diagnosis—whatever it is—can help people get support, so they understand why someone might prefer the autism label.

Some commenters argue that psychiatric diagnoses are always a bit fuzzy, and that’s normal in mental health. Others stress the importance of careful, expert evaluation, since treatment and life outcomes can depend on getting the right diagnosis. A few say that people should not be judged for seeking an identity that helps them explain their struggles.

Overall, the discussion shows that autism and its “cousins” are complicated, and it’s important to look at the whole person, not just a label.

## CATL Expects Oceanic Electric Ships in 3 Years

- 原文链接: [CATL Expects Oceanic Electric Ships in 3 Years](https://cleantechnica.com/2025/12/05/catl-expects-oceanic-electric-ships-in-3-years/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46176169)

CATL says it will have electric ships crossing oceans in about three years. The company already powers ships on rivers and near the coast and now wants to make big ships that use only batteries for trips across the sea.

CATL has been working on marine batteries since 2017. They make batteries not just for ships but also for cars and for storing energy in the power grid. In 2023, CATL launched a system to help ships charge more easily, including battery swapping and cloud-based monitoring. They have already put their batteries in over 900 vessels, like cruise ships, ferries, and tugboats. CATL is working with big shipping companies like Maersk to make shipping cleaner. Battery prices have dropped, and new battery types, such as sodium-ion, could make electric ships cheaper and more common. These new batteries use cheaper materials and are getting better. Studies show that electric ships today can go up to 5,000 kilometers without needing very heavy batteries. CATL says it wants to help electrify not just ships, but also planes in the future.

In the comment section, people have mixed opinions. Some are excited and say this is a big step for clean shipping. Others think oceanic electric ships are still too far away because batteries are heavy and ships need a lot of power for long trips. A few users point out that electric ships might work well for short or medium distances, but not for big cargo ships crossing oceans. Some commenters are hopeful about sodium-ion batteries, saying they will be cheaper and safer than lithium batteries. Other people worry about how ships will recharge at sea, and if ports will have the right equipment. There are questions about the safety of big batteries on ships, especially in storms or if there is a fire. Some users think hybrid ships—using both batteries and other fuels—might be a better solution for now. A few people mention that changes in shipping will take time because ships last a long time and cost a lot to build. Finally, some are happy to see any progress in cutting pollution from shipping, even if it takes longer than three years for the biggest ships to go all-electric.

## Touching the Elephant – TPUs

- 原文链接: [Touching the Elephant – TPUs](https://considerthebulldog.com/tte-tpu/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46172797)

This article looks at the history and design of Google’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which are special chips for machine learning. It starts by saying that while NVIDIA’s GPUs are everywhere, TPUs are unique because they were built just for deep learning and have always been used inside Google.

The article explains that general computer chips used to get faster by waiting for new technology (Moore’s Law), but this stopped working in the 2000s. Neural networks needed more power, so Google designed TPUs to do only the math needed for these models, especially matrix multiplication. The first TPU (v1) was simple: it only handled inference (not training), focused on moving data efficiently, and didn’t use things like caches or multi-threading. Its main part was a big grid of tiny processors (a systolic array) that did matrix math very quickly and with little wasted energy.

Later versions, like TPUv2 and v3, added the ability to train models, used better memory, and improved communication between chips. They switched to a new number format (bf16) that gives good results with less hardware. The chips became more modular, and Google designed special networks inside data centers so thousands of TPUs could work together, using fast links and even optical switches to connect racks.

TPUv4 and v4i focused on scaling up further, adding bigger on-chip memory, new “SparseCores” for models with lots of empty data, and even more complex interconnects. The chips and racks had to be managed by software that could move work around if something failed, and the design balanced cost, speed, and reliability. The article also describes how Google’s software stack, including XLA and Pathways, compiles and schedules work across thousands of chips, making the whole system feel like one big computer. Later TPUs (v5, v6, v7) keep improving, but details are harder to find.

In the Hacker News comments, many readers are impressed by the scale and detail of the TPU design. Some say it shows how important hardware-software co-design is now, especially for AI. Others point out that while the ideas are public, no one else can really copy Google’s system because it needs huge infrastructure and years of experience. People discuss whether TPUs are truly better than GPUs, or just more specialized for Google’s needs.

Some worry about the environmental cost of building and running such big systems. Others are excited by the use of optical switches and the idea of treating the whole data center as one computer. A few commenters wonder if the focus on huge models and big hardware is the right direction for AI, or if smaller, more efficient approaches will win in the end.

There is praise for how Google publishes technical papers and open-sources some tools, making it easier for others to learn. Some people share their own experience with TPUs in the cloud, noting both the speed and the complexity. Others wish that hardware like this was more available outside big companies. Finally, several readers reflect on how much modern computing now depends on careful planning, trade-offs, and teamwork, not just clever new chips.
