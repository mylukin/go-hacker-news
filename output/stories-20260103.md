## Microsoft kills official way to activate Windows 11/10 without internet

- 原文链接: [Microsoft kills official way to activate Windows 11/10 without internet](https://www.neowin.net/news/report-microsoft-quietly-kills-official-way-to-activate-windows-1110-without-internet/#google_vignette)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46480156)

Microsoft has stopped letting people activate Windows 10 and 11 without using the internet. Before, it was possible to activate Windows offline by entering a special code over the phone. Now, this phone method no longer works for the newest Windows versions.

The article says that Microsoft quietly ended this feature. If you try to use the offline or phone activation, the system tells you to use the internet instead. This change affects both Windows 11 and the latest versions of Windows 10. Older computers or versions may still work with phone activation, but new ones do not.

Activation is how Microsoft checks if your copy of Windows is real and not used on too many computers. Phone activation was helpful for people who do not have the internet or need to set up computers in places with no easy connection. With this change, people must now connect to the internet at least once to finish setting up Windows.

The article points out that this is a big problem for special situations. For example, some companies have computers in high-security areas where the internet is not allowed. These companies now have to find new ways to activate Windows. Some people also worry about privacy, because now you must connect to Microsoft servers at least once.

In the comment section, many people are unhappy about the change. Some say Microsoft is making things harder for users, especially for businesses with special needs. Others think this is another way for Microsoft to push people to always be online and watched. A few people understand why Microsoft did this, saying it may help stop piracy or fake activations.

Some commenters share their own stories. One person says they work at a hospital where computers are not allowed to connect to the internet, so this change is a big problem. Another says they have old equipment that cannot go online, and now they do not know what to do. A few people suggest using older versions of Windows or looking for other solutions, but others say this will not work forever.

Some people defend Microsoft, saying most people have the internet anyway, and the company needs to protect its business. Others think Microsoft should still offer offline options for special cases. There is also talk about how this change may push more people to look for illegal ways to activate Windows. Most agree that it is important for companies to warn users before making changes like this.

## The C3 Programming Language

- 原文链接: [The C3 Programming Language](https://c3-lang.org)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46478647)

C3 is a new programming language that tries to improve C while keeping it familiar for C programmers. It is made to work directly with C and C++ code, with no extra steps or special tricks.

C3 has a simple module system, so it is easy to organize code. It lets you use operator overloading, but in a clean way—this helps when working with math types like vectors and matrices. Unlike C, C3 supports compile-time macros that look and feel like normal functions, making code easier to read and more powerful. You can also use contracts, which are rules checked at runtime or compile time, to help catch bugs early. Error handling in C3 mixes the ideas from “Result” types and exceptions, but tries to keep things simple and fast. It also has generic modules, so you can write flexible code that works with different types. C3 gives you reflection at both compile time and runtime, so your code can see its own types and structure. If you need to use assembly language, C3 lets you do that right inside your code. For debugging, C3 adds safety checks and gives you detailed stack traces, so it is easier to find errors like “segmentation faults.”

Many people in the comments are excited about C3’s full compatibility with C. They like that you can mix C and C3 in the same project without trouble. Some users think the module system and contracts are great ideas that could make C programming much safer. Others are happy to see operator overloading without the complexity found in C++. A few commenters like the new error handling, saying it solves old C problems in a clear way. There are concerns, though: some worry that adding new features might make C3 less simple than C. A few people say that other languages have tried to replace C before and failed, so they wonder if C3 will really catch on. Some programmers want to see more real-world examples and want to try it on bigger projects. Others are waiting to see if the C3 compiler and tools are stable and fast enough for serious work. Overall, the community seems hopeful but cautious, interested in seeing how C3 will develop.

## Show HN: Vibe Coding a static site on a $25 Walmart Phone

- 原文链接: [Show HN: Vibe Coding a static site on a $25 Walmart Phone](https://stetsonblake.com/%2425+Walmart+Phone+for+Hackers)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46480677)

This article shows how you can use a $25 Walmart Android phone as a mini Linux server. The writer explains every step, from setting up the phone, to hosting a website, to running other services—all with free tools.

First, you need to install Termux from F-Droid because the Play Store version is old and not updated. Termux lets you use a Linux terminal on your phone. You also install Termux:Boot to run scripts at startup, and optionally Andronix, which helps you install full Linux systems like Ubuntu. The article explains basic Termux commands, like updating packages. For remote access, you set up SSH, so you can connect from your laptop instead of typing on the phone. SSH runs on port 8022 in Termux, and the guide shows how to start it and connect.

To run a Linux distro, you use proot-distro or Andronix. Proot lets you use a Linux root filesystem without needing root access on your phone. But inside this Linux, there is no real init system (like systemd), so services do not start automatically. The writer shares workarounds, like adding scripts to .bashrc or using Supervisor to manage processes.

Android often kills background apps to save battery, so the article gives tips to keep your server running. These include disabling process restrictions in Developer Options, using ADB commands to prevent Android from killing your processes, and using termux-wake-lock to keep the phone awake. For multi-tasking, tmux is recommended.

The guide also shows how to host a website using nginx and Cloudflare Tunnel, making your site public without opening ports. You can also use Tailscale for private networking. The writer includes scripts for starting services automatically and explains how to use Supervisor for better process management.

In the comments, many people are impressed with how much you can do with such a cheap phone. Some say using Android as a server is clever, especially with Termux and proot. Others point out that Android will still kill your apps if you are not careful, and battery life is a problem. Some suggest using old laptops or Raspberry Pi for more power and reliability, but admit that phones are cheaper and easier to find. One person warns about security risks, since Android phones may not get updates for long. Others like the creativity, saying it is fun to see how far you can push cheap hardware. Some share their own stories about running servers on old phones, while a few ask about using iPhones for similar projects, but people explain iOS is much more locked down. Overall, most agree this is a fun and useful experiment for hackers on a budget.

## As deep-sea mining race ramps up, mission will assess whether ecosystems recover

- 原文链接: [As deep-sea mining race ramps up, mission will assess whether ecosystems recover](https://www.science.org/content/article/deep-sea-mining-race-ramps-mission-will-assess-whether-ecosystems-recover-afterward)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46480373)

The article talks about new efforts to start mining in the deep sea for valuable metals. Scientists want to know if the ocean ecosystems can recover after mining happens. Deep-sea mining means digging up the ocean floor to get things like nickel, cobalt, and rare earth metals, which are important for making batteries and electronics. There is a rush to start these projects because the world wants more green energy, and these metals are needed for electric cars and solar panels. But mining the sea floor can hurt animals and plants that live there. The article says some groups are planning missions to study the damage and see if life in these areas can come back after mining stops.

Researchers are worried because deep-sea ecosystems are slow to grow and might not heal for a very long time. Some past studies showed that even after many years, the ocean floor does not return to normal. Scientists want to do more tests before mining becomes common. Companies say they will follow rules to protect the environment, but it is hard to know if these rules will work. The article also points out that many countries are interested in starting mining, so the race is getting faster.

In the comment section, some people think deep-sea mining is too risky and should not happen at all. Others say we need the metals for clean energy, and mining on land also has problems. A few commentors ask if we can recycle old electronics instead of digging for new metals. Some users argue that ocean life is so fragile that we should wait until we have better technology. Others believe strict rules and careful science can help keep damage low. There is debate about whether companies will truly follow safety rules or just try to make money. A few people share that we still know very little about deep-sea life, so it’s dangerous to take chances. Some users hope that new studies will help us understand the risks better before big mining projects begin.

## Publish on your own site, syndicate elsewhere

- 原文链接: [Publish on your own site, syndicate elsewhere](https://indieweb.org/POSSE#)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46468600)

This article talks about POSSE, which means "Publish on your Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere." The idea is that you post new content first on your personal website, and then share copies or links to social media or other platforms. This way, you own your content and your original link, but your friends and followers can still see your posts on the sites they use, like Twitter, Facebook, or Mastodon.

The article explains why POSSE is important. When you post on your own site first, you control your content and are not locked into any one platform. If a social media site goes down or changes its rules, your content is still safe on your own site. Sharing a link back to the original post helps people find your site, improves search ranking, and shows that your site is the main source. Another reason is that it is easier to search your own website for old posts instead of relying on social media search, which is often weak. Also, when people copy your posts from other platforms, they also copy the link to your original, bringing more readers to your site.

The article gives advice for developers who want to use POSSE. It suggests making the sharing process automatic and easy, so you don’t have to do it by hand every time. There are tools and plugins for platforms like WordPress, Medium, and custom sites. For example, you can use Bridgy, IFTTT, or other software to share your posts to different social media. There are different ways to do POSSE: you can publish to your site and let your server share to other sites, or publish to your site and then use a client to share to other platforms. There are also examples from many IndieWeb people showing how they use POSSE on their own websites.

The article also compares POSSE to other methods. "COPE" means "Create Once, Publish Everywhere," but it does not make your site the main home for your content. "PESOS" is the opposite of POSSE; you post first to a third-party site and then copy to your own site, but this does not give you clear ownership. The article also talks about common questions, like worrying about duplicate content penalties from search engines. It recommends always linking back to your original post so search engines know which is the main source.

In the comments, some people like POSSE because it helps keep control over your data and makes it easy to find old posts. They see it as important because social media sites can change or disappear. Others say that POSSE can be hard to set up and is too technical for most users. They wish there were easier tools or guides for beginners. Some users ask if just sharing a link to your blog on social media is good enough, since many platforms show a "card" preview. Others point out that RSS feeds are not enough, because social media sites often do not support RSS well. People also discuss that POSSE is more than just cross-posting; it is about making your own site the main place for your work. Some developers share their own setups and tips on what works and what doesn’t. Others say that manual cross-posting is fine if you don’t want to deal with APIs and plugins. In the end, most agree that owning your content is good, but the tech side needs to be simpler for more people to use POSSE in daily life.

## Exploring Dithering on Spectra 6-color E-Ink Displays

- 原文链接: [Exploring Dithering on Spectra 6-color E-Ink Displays](https://myembeddedstuff.com/e-ink-spectra-6-color)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46440037)

This article talks about getting more than six colors from a Spectra 6-color e-ink display using dithering. The writer used a DIY kit with an ESP32-S3 controller and tried to make new colors by mixing patterns, not just using the display’s built-in colors.

The hardware is flexible—you can use different display sizes and controllers, like ESP32-S3 or nRF chips, each with its own pros (nRF is better for battery life). The 7.3" display tested supports six colors: white, black, yellow, red, green, and blue. The display updates slowly—about 20 to 30 seconds for a full refresh—so it’s best for static images, not things like clocks. Programming is done with Arduino tools, and the Seeed_GFX library makes drawing simple shapes easy, but some features like hardware screen rotation are missing.

The main challenge: the display only has six real colors. The writer wanted more, so tried “dithering”—using patterns of different color pixels to trick the eye into seeing extra colors. For example, a checkerboard pattern of red and yellow looks like orange from a distance. The author tested several dithering techniques (like checkerboard, Bayer, and error diffusion) and found that the simple 50% checkerboard pattern worked best for sharp lines and shapes. More complex methods sometimes made patterns that looked messy or distracted from the design.

With these patterns, the author could simulate many new colors: orange, lime, purple, brown, cyan, and more. Some blends, especially those mixed with white, didn’t look as good, but others (like purple and brown) were close to real colors. The article gives a table showing which colors are native and which are made by mixing.

In the end, the writer says this hardware is great for learning and experimenting. Dithering adds a lot of value, making the display more useful for dashboards, signs, and art, even with slow refresh times.

In the Hacker News comment section, some users were impressed by the creative use of dithering on limited hardware. They liked the clear examples and the practical advice about using simple patterns. Some pointed out that slow refresh rates are the main weakness of color e-ink, but agreed that for static content, it’s not a big problem. Others wondered how far dithering could go—could you make photo-realistic images, or is it only good for simple icons and shapes? There were suggestions to test even more advanced algorithms or mix in partial refreshes, though some thought that might not work well with e-ink’s physics. A few users debated whether it’s better to use more expensive hardware with more colors, or stick with clever software tricks like dithering. Some also discussed battery life, saying that using nRF chips with less power draw could help if you want the display to last for months. Overall, the community liked the DIY, experimental approach and saw lots of possibilities for new projects using these affordable displays.

## Sirius DB

- 原文链接: [Sirius DB](https://www.sirius-db.com/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46441781)

Sirius is a new SQL engine that uses GPUs to make data analytics much faster. It connects to databases like DuckDB without big changes and claims to speed up queries by 10× or more, at the same hardware cost.

The main idea is to run SQL queries directly on GPUs, which are much better at handling lots of data in parallel than regular CPUs. You don’t need to rewrite your queries, because Sirius uses the Substrait standard to talk with other databases. If there is no GPU available, Sirius can switch back to using the CPU, so it always works. The team says Sirius can be up to 60× faster than ClickHouse in some tests. You can run it almost anywhere—on the cloud or on your own servers. The project is open source, and you can find the code on GitHub. The website lists many papers about how their system works and how they improve things like joins and data compression on GPUs.

In the Hacker News comments, some users are excited about GPU-powered analytics and want to try Sirius with their data. A few people ask about real-world use cases and wonder if the speedup will be as good as the benchmarks say. Some worry about GPU availability and cost, especially for small teams who do not have powerful servers. Others point out that moving data to and from the GPU can be a bottleneck, so the actual speedup might depend on the size of your data and how often you run big queries. There are questions about GPU compatibility, especially with different brands and cloud providers. A few users discuss the benefits of using standards like Substrait, saying it makes it easier to add Sirius to existing tools. Some compare Sirius to older GPU database projects and wonder how it is different or better. Others mention that open sourcing the code is great for research and for people who want to try new ideas. A few people note that this could help make analytics cheaper if the speedups are real, but they want to see more public benchmarks. Some users are excited about the roadmap and hope for more features in the future. Overall, people think GPU-powered SQL is interesting, but want to see how it works in practice.

## Experiments with Ableton-MCP

- 原文链接: [Experiments with Ableton-MCP](https://jhurliman.org/post/804323197731373056/experiments-with-ableton-mcp-dec-2025)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46428922)

This article is about someone experimenting with Ableton Live and a tool called ableton-mcp, which lets large language models (LLMs) control the music software. The author wanted to automate music production tasks, so they tried using ableton-mcp and added their own new tools.

At first, the tool could do basic edits in Ableton’s Session view but couldn’t handle more advanced music workflows, like mixing or working in Arrangement view. The author used LLMs to read documentation, create new features, and even reverse engineer Ableton’s project files to add things like tempo and volume changes. One special tool, called vocal_to_midi, let the software turn parts of a vocal recording into MIDI notes for drums—helpful for lining up vocals with beats more accurately.

However, the big problem was that the LLM couldn’t actually “hear” the music it was making. To fix this, the author made a patch so the computer could record audio from Ableton as WAV files. Then, they used two online AI models: one for analyzing a song’s structure and tempo, and another for answering questions about music theory using audio input. While the author didn’t fully automate everything, these tools helped a lot.

The author decided to make a mashup track as a test. They picked an instrumental song, found the correct tempo and key, and then chose a vocal track that matched well. After days of both computer and manual work, plus lots of trial and error, they uploaded the finished mashup. Each time they uploaded, they found something to improve—like the sound levels or final mixing—so they uploaded several versions.

The author says that using ableton-mcp with LLMs helped them learn Ableton faster than just reading blogs or watching videos. Having an AI “pair programmer” for music made the process less scary and more productive. All their code and notes are available online for others to try.

In the Hacker News comments, many people liked the idea of using LLMs to control music software, saying it could help beginners learn faster. Some users worried that letting AI write music might make everything sound the same, or take away creative control from humans. Others pointed out that being able to automate boring tasks could let musicians spend more time on creative ideas. A few commenters asked about the technical details, like how safe it is to let AI change project files, or if it could break something in Ableton. Some people wondered if this approach could work with other music software, not just Ableton. There were also suggestions to add even more audio feedback, like letting the AI “listen” in real time. Overall, the discussion was positive, with many users excited to see what comes next for AI and music tools.

## Xr0 verifier, guarantee the safety of C programs at compile time

- 原文链接: [Xr0 verifier, guarantee the safety of C programs at compile time](https://xr0.dev)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46479673)

This article is about Xr0, a tool that checks C programs for safety problems at compile time. The main goal is to help C programmers stop bugs like use-after-free, double free, null pointer dereference, and using uninitialized memory.

With Xr0, programmers add special notes, called annotations, to their C code. These annotations tell both humans and the tool what each function does and what is needed to use it safely. For example, if a function gives back memory, the annotation will say the caller must free it. These notes can also explain conditions, like "free if this variable is not zero."

The tool works by spreading safety information through every function call, so small mistakes cannot hide deep in the code. The article says Xr0 is like a type system that covers all the details about safety. However, Xr0 does not fix unsafe code itself; the programmer still has to write safe code. Xr0 only checks the work. Right now, Xr0 can check most of C89, but it cannot yet fully check loops or recursive functions, so users need to add extra notes for those.

Xr0 is free, open source, and written in C. People can try it online, read tutorials, and join the project’s Discord or email the creators for help or feedback.

People in the comments are excited about making C safer, since many bugs in C come from memory mistakes. Some think the annotation style is clear and helpful, while others worry it may take extra work to add and keep up all the notes, especially for big code bases. A few think that having to write the annotations might make people write better code, but some wonder if programmers will skip this step or make mistakes in the notes. One person points out that tools like Rust do this sort of check as part of the language, while Xr0 adds it to C, which could help old projects. Another commenter likes that Xr0 works with normal C and does not need big changes. Some ask about support for newer C features or for C++, and others mention that missing loop and recursion checks is a big problem for now. People agree that tools like Xr0 can help, but good training and careful work are still needed to write safe C code. Overall, many are hopeful, but want to see how well Xr0 works in real projects.
