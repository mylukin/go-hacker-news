Hello everyone, this is the 2025-09-30 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we bring you three of the most talked about stories in the tech world.

First, let’s talk about Atuin Desktop, a new open source tool for developers that is getting a lot of attention. Atuin Desktop turns written guides and runbooks into scripts or commands you can run directly on your computer. The main idea is to solve the problem where important commands and fixes are lost in chat messages, old documents, or someone’s memory. Their previous tool, Atuin CLI, was good for searching your shell history, but it was not enough. Atuin Desktop takes things further. Now, you can write documentation that stays updated, run scripts, database queries, and check charts, all in one place. You can link tasks together, use templates, and even pull commands from your real shell history. Teams can share and update these runbooks together, using Git or working in real time. Since the closed beta in April, the team has made many improvements: Atuin Desktop now works offline, supports team workspaces, and has integrations with Kubernetes and MySQL. Many bugs have been fixed as well. People are using it for automating tasks, managing databases, onboarding new staff, and handling outages.

Looking ahead, the team plans to let runbooks run in the cloud, add better permission controls, and support more step types. They want Atuin Desktop to be a living record of how to keep systems running, not just a pile of old notes.

In the comments, many users are excited about documentation that actually works. Some think it could save hours during outages or when new team members join. Others compare it to tools like Jupyter Notebook, but for DevOps and operations. Some people ask about security, like how secrets are handled and if it’s safe to run shared scripts. Many are happy the tool is open source and think it will help the community. But there are also worries it could become too complex for small teams. Some ask about how it works with Git or cloud platforms. Others say they have the same problems at work and want to try Atuin Desktop with their team. People hope this tool can really help keep docs fresh and useful. A few note that setup must be easy and safe for wide adoption.

Next, we move to the aviation industry. Boeing has started designing a new airplane to replace the 737 MAX, which is one of the world’s best-selling planes but is now aging. There is strong pressure from airlines and competition from Airbus. The 737 MAX had serious problems in the past, including crashes and grounding, damaging Boeing’s reputation. Airlines want new planes that use less fuel, are safer, and can carry more passengers. Boeing plans to use new materials and technology to make the new plane lighter and more efficient. They also want to make it easier to build, with fewer delays and lower costs. New engine designs are being considered to save even more fuel. But creating a brand new airplane is a big job. It takes over ten years and billions of dollars. Boeing must make sure the new plane is safe and passes all regulations. Details are still few, but Boeing is working with airlines to learn what is needed. This new model may help Boeing compete with Airbus, which already has the popular A320neo. The project is at an early stage, so we won’t see the new plane flying for many years.

In the comments, some people say Boeing should have started this project earlier, instead of just updating the old 737. Others think Boeing is finally taking the right step. Some worry that a focus on cost-cutting could hurt safety and quality. There is excitement about new technology, with hopes for a greener and quieter plane. But many point out that making a new plane comes with big risks and takes a long time. Some wonder if airlines will move to Airbus if Boeing is too slow. Others talk about Boeing’s leadership and if the company can manage such a huge project. People mention that pilots and mechanics will need new training, and some ask if Boeing will fix its work culture and regain trust. Overall, there is hope that competition will bring better and safer planes for everyone.

Finally, let’s look at the latest Apple leak. A Geekbench result for a new iPad called “iPad17,3” with an M5 chip and 9 CPU cores has appeared online. The scores are impressive: 4,133 in single-core and 15,437 in multi-core tests. This is a big jump over older iPads. The M5 chip has 9 CPU cores—3 high-performance and 6 efficiency cores—and runs at 4.42 GHz. The tested device has 11.2 GB of memory and runs iOS 26.0. It does very well in web browsing, PDF rendering, photo editing, and code compiling. For instance, it can load almost 368 web pages per second and compress files at 1.73 GB per second. It is also strong in AI tasks, like object detection and background blur. The larger memory and cache should help with multitasking and heavy apps. Many think this means the new iPad is faster than most laptops and could be great for creative work, gaming, and maybe even replacing a laptop.

In the comments, many people are excited about the M5’s performance. They say Apple’s chips keep improving and now beat many Intel and AMD laptop CPUs. Some wonder why the M5 has 9 cores and guess it’s for a balance of speed and battery life. A few doubt the leak is real, but others say it fits Apple’s usual upgrade pattern. Some developers hope Apple will allow more pro software on iPad since the hardware is so strong now. There are also comments about good photo and video editing, but some users still want better file management and more software freedom. A few people joke that phones and tablets are now almost too fast for most tasks. Others note that Apple’s chips are leading the industry and pushing rivals to improve. Most commenters are impressed by the leaked scores and are curious what Apple will do next.

That’s all for today’s episode. Thank you for listening to Hacker News Daily Podcast. See you tomorrow.
