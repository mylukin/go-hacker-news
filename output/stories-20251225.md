## Python 3.15’s interpreter for Windows x86-64 should hopefully be 15% faster

- 原文链接: [Python 3.15’s interpreter for Windows x86-64 should hopefully be 15% faster](https://fidget-spinner.github.io/posts/no-longer-sorry.html)

Python 3.15 plans to make its interpreter about 15% faster on Windows x86-64 computers. The article explains how this speedup comes from using a new way to run Python code, called the “tail-calling interpreter,” instead of the old “switch-case” or “computed goto” methods.

The old switch-case way means the interpreter uses a big function with many cases, choosing what to do next with a switch statement. The computed goto way, often used on Linux and macOS, jumps straight to the next instruction using special tricks, but it only brings a small speedup on modern computers. The new tail-calling method turns every interpreter step into a small function, each calling the next as a “tail call.” This can be faster, but only if the C compiler promises to always do tail calls. Before, compilers did not always do this, which could crash the program.

Now, Microsoft’s Visual Studio 2026 (MSVC) has a feature to force tail calls, allowing Python to use this method safely. Tests show about 15% faster performance on average, with some scripts running up to 40% faster. The reason for the speedup seems to be that smaller functions help the compiler do its job better, like inlining (putting small functions directly into the code), which it could not do with the huge old interpreter function. The new method also makes it less likely for the compiler to get confused or slow down when optimizing. The speedup is bigger for small, pure-Python scripts but still good for large projects.

To try this now, people need to build Python from source with special settings, but the plan is to make it easy for everyone when Python 3.15 is ready. The article thanks the MSVC team and several contributors for making this possible.

In the comments, many readers are excited about the speedup and the technical achievement. Some people ask if this will also make Python faster on Linux or macOS. Others wonder if the new method could bring trouble, like harder debugging or stack traces. A few warn that experimental compiler features might change or break in the future. Some developers share their own stories about interpreter design and compiler problems, agreeing that giant functions are tough for compilers to handle. Others discuss if this approach could help other languages or old projects stuck with slow interpreters. A few people are surprised that Python’s interpreter still uses such “old school” methods and are glad to see new ideas. Some are careful to point out that real-world speed might depend on the kind of code you run. Most agree this is a big step forward for Python on Windows, and they look forward to trying it soon.

## CUDA Tile Open Sourced

- 原文链接: [CUDA Tile Open Sourced](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-tile)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46330732)

NVIDIA has open-sourced CUDA Tile, a new tool to help make CUDA programs faster by using tile-based computation patterns. CUDA Tile is built on MLIR (a kind of compiler framework) and helps developers write and optimize code for NVIDIA GPUs, especially for tasks that use tensor cores.

CUDA Tile has several key pieces. It gives you a special way to describe tiled computations, has a Python API so you can write and change programs in Python, and lets you save and load programs in a fast binary format. There’s also a test suite to check that everything works correctly and follows the rules of CUDA Tile.

To use CUDA Tile, you need CMake, a C++17 compiler, Python 3.6 or newer, and some MLIR/LLVM tools. You can let it download and build these tools for you, or use your own copies if you have them. There are also options for enabling Python features and using ccache to speed up building.

For testing, CUDA Tile uses the same system as LLVM. You can run tests easily with a single command. To add CUDA Tile to your own project, you can either use its pre-built libraries or include its source code directly and build it together with your project.

The article gives a simple example: you write a small CUDA Tile program in MLIR that loads and prints some data, then compile it to bytecode, compile that to a GPU binary, and finally run a C++ host program to launch the kernel on a GPU. The expected output is a printed list of numbers, showing the data was loaded and processed as intended.

Right now, NVIDIA is not accepting code contributions from the public, but you can report bugs or give feedback. The project uses the Apache License v2.0 with LLVM exceptions.

In the Hacker News comments, some people are happy to see NVIDIA open up more of their tools, calling this a step forward for the GPU community. Several users are excited about the MLIR-based design, saying it makes it easier to build new compilers and tools. A few think this will help researchers and companies make faster machine learning code.

Other commenters worry that since NVIDIA isn’t taking outside code changes, the “open source” part feels limited. Some wish the project supported more hardware, not just NVIDIA GPUs. There are questions about how hard it is to set up all the build tools, and a few people share tips for getting around common build errors.

One developer says the Python API could be very useful for rapid testing and learning. Another asks if this could help port code to AMD or Intel GPUs, but others answer that CUDA Tile is very tied to NVIDIA tech. Some commenters hope NVIDIA will let the community contribute code in the future. Finally, a few users mention that this is mainly useful for advanced users, but it’s a positive sign for more open development in the GPU world.

## Archiving Git branches as tags

- 原文链接: [Archiving Git branches as tags](https://etc.octavore.com/2025/12/archiving-git-branches-as-tags/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46357362)

This article talks about a way to archive old Git branches by turning them into tags. The writer explains how to do this using a custom Git command (an alias).

The main idea is to keep your Git history clean. Old branches can be hard to manage and might fill up your list. By turning branches into tags, you keep a record of them, but they are less visible, so your active branch list is shorter. The author shares a special alias for Git, called `archive-branch`. This alias takes the branch you want to archive, creates a tag with the branch’s name (adding “archive/” at the start), and then deletes the branch. The tag keeps the branch’s state, but you no longer see the branch in your regular list.

The alias uses some Bash “magic.” It wraps the command in a function and runs it right away. The first line is `: git switch`, which does nothing but helps with auto-completion. This trick lets you use tab to complete branch names, just like with the normal `git switch` command. To make this work, you need the official Git completion scripts. On macOS, if you use Zsh (a popular shell), you must set up the right files and link them, because Zsh’s default Git completion does not support this kind of trick. The article gives step-by-step commands for this setup, especially for people using Git from Xcode.

Finally, the writer says this idea came from a Reddit thread about best practices for archiving old branches.

In the comments, some readers like the trick and think it’s a clean way to keep history without cluttering the branch list. Others warn that deleting branches, even if tagged, might cause confusion if people try to work on those branches later. A few say that tags and branches are different in Git, and you should be careful not to mix them up—branches are for ongoing work, tags are for marking points in history. Some people share their own scripts or ways to handle old branches, like using “archive” folders or just deleting branches after merging. One reader points out that using tags makes it harder to see which branches are still active, which helps teams stay focused. Another asks if this would cause problems with remote branches on shared projects. Someone else explains that you need to delete the remote branch manually, and this solution only works locally unless you push the tag and delete the branch on the server too. Overall, most say it’s a clever use of Git’s features, but it’s important to tell your team what you’re doing, so no one gets surprised.

## I sell onions on the Internet (2019)

- 原文链接: [I sell onions on the Internet (2019)](https://www.deepsouthventures.com/i-sell-onions-on-the-internet/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46385308)

This story is about a man who sells Vidalia onions online, even though he isn’t a farmer. He started by buying the domain VidaliaOnions.com at an auction, not planning to build a business, but the name kept making him think about what he could do with it. He likes buying domain names and sometimes turns them into small businesses, letting the domain idea lead the way. After buying the onion domain, he remembered how people order fruit online and decided to try selling onions directly from farmers to customers.

He had no farming or shipping experience, but he reached out to the Vidalia Onion committee, who introduced him to farmers. He partnered with a farmer named Aries Haygood, whose family had grown onions for 25 years. They guessed they might sell 50 orders in their first season but got over 600. He handled the website, customer service, and marketing, while the farmer handled growing and packing. They grew so much that other farms stopped selling onions by mail and sent customers to him instead.

He tried different ways to advertise, like a billboard and sponsoring local events. They even added a phone order option, which sometimes did better than online sales. Not everything went well—he once lost $10,000 on bad shipping boxes, which almost made him quit. But he kept going because his customers loved the service, calling him “The Vidalia Man.”

He says the business is more about purpose than profit and feels lucky to be part of it. He enjoys helping people get onions they love and finds the work very satisfying.

Commenters on Hacker News liked the story and found it inspiring. Many said they enjoyed hearing about a small, simple business started by someone not in the industry. Some people loved the focus on taking action, even without a big plan or investors. Others pointed out that owning a good domain name can really help a business. A few shared their own stories of starting small web projects or niche businesses. Some were surprised how much people love Vidalia onions and liked the direct-to-customer idea. Others asked about handling shipping problems and how to avoid big mistakes. A few people wondered about the risks of depending on one product. Some said this story shows you don’t need to invent new technology to build something meaningful. Overall, the story made many readers smile and think about starting their own small projects.

## All I Want for Christmas Is Your Secrets: LangGrinch hits LangChain Core

- 原文链接: [All I Want for Christmas Is Your Secrets: LangGrinch hits LangChain Core](https://cyata.ai/blog/langgrinch-langchain-core-cve-2025-68664/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46386009)

This article explains a critical security bug found in LangChain Core, a popular AI framework used by many developers. The bug is called CVE-2025-68664, and it lets attackers steal secrets or even run harmful code if not fixed.

The problem comes from how LangChain handles special data when saving (“serializing”) and loading (“deserializing”) information. LangChain marks some data with a key called “lc” to know it’s a special object. But the functions dumps() and dumpd() did not check if user data also had this “lc” key. Because of this, if an attacker could make data with “lc” inside, the system could treat it as trusted and do unsafe things.

This vulnerability is very serious because LangChain Core is used everywhere, with millions of downloads each month. A single prompt—just one message to an AI—could trigger this bug, making it very dangerous and wide-reaching. The bug affected common features like event streaming, logging, message history, and caches.

If an attacker used this bug, they could steal secret keys from environment variables (like AWS keys), and sometimes even run their own code. The problem was made worse because secret extraction was turned on by default until the fix. The issue was not because of bad code, but because a security check was missing.

The researcher found the bug by checking where untrusted data gets serialized and deserialized in LangChain. They reported the problem, and the LangChain team quickly released fixes and changed the defaults to be safer. The researcher received a $4,000 bounty, the highest given by the project so far.

Technical details showed that the “lc” marker helps LangChain know which objects are special, but if user data isn’t checked, it can be confused for an internal object. Also, some classes in LangChain can make network calls or do other actions when created, which attackers could use. There was also a risk with Jinja2 templates, which can run code if misused.

To be safe, everyone using LangChain should update to the latest version. All outputs from AI models (LLMs) should be treated as untrusted, especially if they get saved and then loaded again later. Secret handling features should be turned off unless you are sure the data is safe.

Hacker News commenters had a lot to say about this vulnerability. Some praised the detailed write-up and quick response from the LangChain team. Many were surprised that such a basic mistake—forgetting to escape a reserved key—could slip through for so long in such a high-profile project.

Others pointed out that using serialization and deserialization is always risky, especially with untrusted data. Some compared this bug to old Java deserialization bugs or problems in other languages like PHP, saying that developers should always be careful with object loading features.

A few commenters worried that AI frameworks are moving too fast and not paying enough attention to security. They said more projects need to review how they handle “untrusted” data, especially since prompt injection is becoming a big problem in AI systems.

Some people argued that this isn’t just a technical issue, but a sign that organizations need better control and visibility over their AI systems. They liked the article’s suggestion to track where and how agent code runs in production.

There were also comments about bug bounties, with some saying $4,000 is not enough for such a big discovery, while others felt it was fair.

A number of users shared tips for improving security, like always upgrading dependencies, using allowlists, and never trusting user input—even if it comes from an AI. Some called for better defaults in popular frameworks, so these problems don’t happen again.

Finally, a few people pointed out that this bug isn’t limited to LangChain or Python, but could affect other languages and tools using similar patterns, so the whole industry should watch out.

## Show HN: Lamp Carousel – DIY kinetic sculpture powered by lamp heat (2024)

- 原文链接: [Show HN: Lamp Carousel – DIY kinetic sculpture powered by lamp heat (2024)](https://evan.widloski.com/posts/spinners/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46379145)

This article shows how to make spinning sculptures from empty soda cans that move using heat from a lamp. The writer calls them “can spinners” and says they are like candle carousels seen at Christmas. You make these by cutting shapes from soda cans, making a small dent in the middle, and balancing them on a sharp wire over a lamp. As the lamp heats up, warm air rises and causes the spinner to turn. The author explains each step, like sharpening the wire, cutting the can, making the dimple, shaping the blades, and then balancing the spinner. Thinner can sides are easier to cut, but they can wear out at the center after spinning for weeks. Thicker can bottoms last longer. The spinners can be attached to a lamp with the wire, and even LED bulbs will work, though not as well as old incandescent bulbs. The writer shares pictures of different shapes his family made, like turbines, propellers, and windmills. Some shapes spin better than others, and the writer learned by trying new designs.

People in the comments liked how simple and fun the idea is. Some said it reminded them of old Christmas decorations or science toys from their childhood. A few were impressed that you can use recycled cans and basic tools. Others talked about safety, mentioning sharp edges or the risk if the spinner falls onto a hot bulb. Some suggested ways to make the spinner last longer, like using a harder wire or a tiny bead for the pivot point. A few people wanted to see a video of the spinners in action. One commenter asked if this could work with sunlight instead of a lamp. Another person joked about making very big spinners. Some readers liked the creativity and said they would try this project with their kids. Others discussed how the heat rising causes the spinner to move, and some gave extra physics tips. Overall, the comments were positive and showed interest in simple, hands-on projects.

## Alzheimer’s disease can be reversed in animal models? Study

- 原文链接: [Alzheimer’s disease can be reversed in animal models? Study](https://case.edu/news/new-study-shows-alzheimers-disease-can-be-reversed-achieve-full-neurological-recovery-not-just-prevented-or-slowed-animal-models)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46384919)

A new study says Alzheimer’s disease can be reversed in mice, not just slowed or stopped. The research team from Case Western Reserve University and other centers found that fixing the brain’s energy balance, especially the levels of a molecule called NAD+, helped sick mice recover fully.

Alzheimer’s disease has long been seen as a disease that only gets worse and cannot be cured. Most research until now has tried to prevent it or slow it down, but never to bring back lost brain function. The scientists used mice with human gene mutations that cause Alzheimer’s, making these mice good for studying the disease. In both mice and human brains with Alzheimer’s, the team saw that a molecule called NAD+ drops to very low levels. NAD+ is important for cells to work well. When its level falls, cells in the brain cannot do their jobs and start to die.

The team used a drug called P7C3-A20, which helps restore NAD+ balance in the brain. They tried giving this drug both before and after the mice got very sick. In both cases, the drug either stopped the disease or even reversed the damage. Mice that already had lost brain function got better and their brains fixed themselves. The mice also did better on memory tests, and their brains looked healthier. Blood tests also showed that a marker for Alzheimer’s disease, called phosphorylated tau 217, went back to normal.

The study’s leaders say these results mean that it might be possible to help people recover from Alzheimer’s, not just slow it down. They warn, though, that over-the-counter NAD+ boosters can be dangerous and may cause cancer in animal tests if NAD+ goes too high. Their drug works by keeping NAD+ at a safe level. They hope to start testing this treatment in people soon, and are working to find out if it could help with other brain diseases. The team says this is a message of hope, because maybe even a damaged brain can sometimes heal.

People commenting on Hacker News had mixed feelings about this news. Some users were very excited and called the study a breakthrough. Others were more careful, pointing out that many things that work in mice do not help people in real life. A few said they want to see real human trials before getting too hopeful. Some worried about safety, especially with boosting NAD+ levels, and asked about possible side effects. There were comments about how Alzheimer’s is a very hard disease to treat, and many past “cures” have failed in humans. One user was glad the study did not promote over-the-counter supplements, which could be risky. Some people asked about how the drug works, and if it could help with other diseases. Others discussed how hard it is to get new drugs approved, and hoped this research would lead to real treatments soon. Many agreed that even if this is early, it is an important step, and they hope for more good news in the future.
