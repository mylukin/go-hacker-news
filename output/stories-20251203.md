## Ghostty is now non-profit

- 原文链接: [Ghostty is now non-profit](https://mitchellh.com/writing/ghostty-non-profit)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46138238)

Ghostty, a modern terminal project, is now officially a non-profit under the Hack Club organization. This move means Ghostty is managed as a charitable project, focusing on being free and open source for everyone.

The article explains that fiscal sponsorship lets Hack Club handle things like compliance, donations, and legal work, so the developers can focus on building Ghostty. The founder, Mitchell Hashimoto, says this change helps keep Ghostty safe from being sold or changed for profit, and it builds trust with users. He also says that even though he is the main donor now, the non-profit status allows others to give money safely, knowing it will only help the project. All money coming in and out will be visible to the public, and there are strict rules so no funds can go to him personally. The project’s name and code are now owned by the non-profit, and Ghostty will keep its MIT license and technical goals. Ghostty also wants to start paying contributors, support other related projects, and cover community costs. Hack Club will take 7% of all donations for their help and to support their own mission. The founder’s family is also giving $150,000 directly to Hack Club, not to Ghostty, to show extra support.

In the comments, many people praise the move, saying it builds more trust and sets a good example for open-source projects. Some are happy that Ghostty is not tied to one person or a company, so it can last longer. Others point out that non-profit status helps with donations and shows the project is serious about being open. A few people share concerns that even with a non-profit, the main leader still has a lot of control, but most agree that legal rules do help. Some ask questions about how decisions will be made if leadership changes in the future. Others are interested in how transparent the finances will be, and are glad to see a public ledger. A few users talk about Hack Club, saying they do good work for young people in tech, so the 7% fee seems fair. Some comment on how rare it is for terminal projects to get this kind of attention and funding. A couple of people wonder if this model might work for other open-source tools. In general, the community is positive, wishing Ghostty success and hoping more projects will choose similar paths.

## Reverse engineering a $1B Legal AI tool exposed 100k+ confidential files

- 原文链接: [Reverse engineering a $1B Legal AI tool exposed 100k+ confidential files](https://alexschapiro.com/security/vulnerability/2025/12/02/filevine-api-100k)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46137514)

A security researcher found a big problem in a billion-dollar legal AI tool called Filevine. This tool is used by law firms to manage very private legal files and information.

The researcher wanted to see how safe the tool was, so he looked for demo versions of the site. He found a special subdomain and checked what happened when it loaded. He found some hidden JavaScript code that showed how the site talks to its data storage system. By looking at the code, he discovered an API endpoint (a web address where the app gets data) that did not need any login or password. Using this, he could send a simple request with any project name, and the server would reply with a special access token.

This token was not just for one project—it gave full admin access to the law firm’s entire file storage system, like an open door to everything inside. The storage had all kinds of confidential files, including client documents, legal memos, payrolls, and even files protected by court orders and HIPAA. When he searched for the word “confidential,” he got almost 100,000 results, showing the scale of the problem.

Realizing how serious this was, he stopped looking further and told the company right away. Filevine responded quickly, fixed the issue, and thanked the researcher. This is an example of good responsible disclosure—where the finder tells the company first and gives them time to fix it before telling the public.

If a bad person had found this problem, they could have stolen millions of very private legal documents, causing huge harm to the law firm and its clients. The researcher warns other companies to be careful with AI tools and always check how safe they are before trusting them with sensitive data.

People commenting on Hacker News had strong reactions. Some were shocked that such a big company made a basic security mistake, like leaving an admin key open without any protection. Others praised the researcher for acting responsibly and not looking at the confidential files or sharing details before the fix. Many said this shows why companies should not rush to use new AI tools, especially for important legal or medical work.

Some commenters explained that API security is often missed when companies move fast, especially in the AI “gold rush.” Others pointed out that even big, rich companies can have poor security if they don’t test properly. A few said this is why lawyers and clients should ask hard questions about how their data is stored. Some worried that many other companies might have similar problems and just haven’t been checked yet. There were also comments about how good it was that Filevine responded quickly and worked with the researcher, setting a good example for other firms. Others asked if the company should face legal action or penalties for exposing such sensitive files. Overall, the story is a big warning for everyone using or building AI tools that handle private information.

## Acme, a brief history of one of the protocols which has changed the Internet

- 原文链接: [Acme, a brief history of one of the protocols which has changed the Internet](https://blog.brocas.org/2025/12/01/ACME-a-brief-history-of-one-of-the-protocols-which-has-changed-the-Internet-Security/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46141745)

This article talks about the ACME protocol and how it changed Internet security by making HTTPS easy and free for everyone. It explains how, before 2015, most websites did not use encryption, which meant many people’s data was not private or safe online.

The main problem was that getting a security certificate for your website was hard, slow, and often cost money. A group from Mozilla, EFF, Akamai, Cisco, and the University of Michigan started Let’s Encrypt to fix this problem. Let’s Encrypt gives out free certificates and uses the ACME protocol to do this automatically, so website owners do not need to do anything by hand. ACME lets software prove it controls a website, using special challenges like HTTP, DNS, or TLS, and then gets a certificate without a person involved. This changed everything because now even small websites could use HTTPS without paying or knowing much about security.

The article says that ACME was made open and became an official Internet standard in 2019, which helped other groups use it too. There are now many different ACME clients, so it works on almost any system. Let’s Encrypt’s work made HTTPS use go from about 40% to over 80% worldwide. The article also talks about how ACME keeps improving, like with the ARI extension to help renew certificates faster if there is a problem. The biggest challenge now is making sure people keep their ACME clients up to date, since many just set it and forget it. The protocol is also used by other certificate authorities, both free and paid, and even by private companies for their own internal systems.

In the Hacker News comments, many people say ACME and Let’s Encrypt made the web much safer and easier for everyone, not just big companies. Some users remember when getting a certificate was expensive and slow, and they are happy that is no longer true. Others like how ACME is open, so anyone can use it or help improve it. A few people share stories about how easy it was to set up HTTPS now, compared to before. Some mention problems, like having to update scripts or clients as ACME changes, and worry about what happens if people do not update them. There are also comments about how short certificate lifetimes will make automation even more important.

A few users ask if ACME could be used for other things, like device authentication, and some say it is already starting to happen. Some point out that while HTTPS is much more common now, there are still places where encryption is not used, especially outside the US. There are also technical discussions about which ACME challenges are best, and some users share tips for using ACME with private certificate authorities at work. Overall, most people are positive and say ACME and Let’s Encrypt are big wins for open standards, security, and the Internet as a whole.

## Micron Announces Exit from Crucial Consumer Business

- 原文链接: [Micron Announces Exit from Crucial Consumer Business](https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-announces-exit-crucial-consumer-business)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46137783)

Micron, a big memory chip maker, just said it will stop selling Crucial consumer products. Crucial is the brand people know for buying SSDs and RAM for their own computers. The article explains that Micron wants to focus more on making memory for business and data center customers, not for home users. They believe the business market is more stable and can bring better profits. Micron says they will keep making and selling memory, but only for companies, not for regular people. They promise to support existing Crucial customers for a while. This change means that soon, you probably won't see Crucial SSDs or RAM in stores.

Some reasons for this decision are lower profits in the consumer market, strong competition, and changing demand. Companies and cloud providers now buy lots of memory, so Micron wants to serve them instead. The article does not say exactly when Crucial products will disappear, but it is clear that Micron is moving away from selling to home users.

Hacker News readers have mixed feelings about this news. Some people say they trusted Crucial and used their products for many years, so they feel sad or worried about losing a good option. Others think this is a smart move for Micron, since selling to companies might be less risky and more profitable. Some commenters point out that the consumer memory market is tough, with lots of price wars and small profit margins. A few people wonder what will happen to support, replacement parts, or warranties for Crucial products they already own. Others say there are still many other memory brands to pick from, so it may not be a big problem for most people. Some hope Micron's exit will give smaller brands a chance to grow, while others worry about less competition and higher prices in the future. A few readers share memories of building their first computer with Crucial RAM and feel nostalgic. Overall, the comments show both concern for home users and understanding of Micron’s business decision.

## 1D Conway's Life glider found, 3.7B cells long

- 原文链接: [1D Conway's Life glider found, 3.7B cells long](https://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?&p=222136#p222136)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46137253)

This article talks about the first discovery of a true one-dimensional spaceship (or "glider") in Conway’s Game of Life, with a length of 3.7 billion cells. The main focus is on the technical work and the excitement in the community after this breakthrough.

The spaceship is called “unidimensional” because, at the start, it is only one cell thick in the vertical direction, but very long horizontally. The build uses new and old techniques to make the pattern move forward, clean up after itself, and repeat its cycle. The main creator, Hippo.69, explains many problems and fixes during the project—like handling stray gliders, debugging seeds, and making sure the simulation does not break. Debugging was hard because the pattern is huge, and normal tools are too slow, so special tricks and software were used to simulate and check the pattern.

The ship is made from several “arms” that use gliders to build, destroy, and move parts of the pattern. There are “fuse” arms to start the process, “binary arms” for writing bits, and “ecca” arms for more efficient construction and destruction. Each arm has to work with perfect timing, firing gliders at the right place and right phase. The article also shares code for running and checking the pattern in Golly, a popular Life simulator.

After many retries and careful debugging, the ship finally works, and the final files are shared for others to run and test. The ship has a period of 133,076,755,768 generations and a starting bounding box of 3,707,300,605 by 1 cell. The simulation results match, so the discovery is confirmed by others in the community. There is also discussion about naming the ship (like “Arrow 1” or “Unidimensional Spaceship 1”), and ideas for making it smaller or building even thicker spaceships in the future.

In the comments, many users share congratulations and excitement. Some tried running the pattern but found it too big for their computers. Several people ask for a simple explanation or a wiki page to help others understand how it works. There are questions about stray gliders seen in the simulation, with the creator explaining these were due to a small mistake in the sample file, not the actual design. Some discuss if this is the slowest possible spaceship and how to make different types (like two-cell thick ships).

Other comments talk about the technical tools used, like special software for building patterns, and the need for a scientific paper to explain everything. There are jokes, suggestions for naming, and hopes for more one-dimensional or “macro” spaceships soon. Some users want to know if any reaction can be turned into a spaceship using these methods, and others confirm the results and post the verification code. Finally, people share ideas for future improvements and wonder where such technical articles could be published.

## RCE Vulnerability in React and Next.js

- 原文链接: [RCE Vulnerability in React and Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-9qr9-h5gf-34mp)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46136026)

A new security problem was found in React and Next.js, which could let attackers run code on your server without permission. This issue affects certain versions of React (19.0.0 to 19.2.0) and Next.js (15.x and 16.x) when using the App Router or special React Server Component packages.

The vulnerability is very serious, with the highest possible risk score (10 out of 10). Attackers do not need any special access or user help to use this bug—they can attack from anywhere on the internet. If they succeed, they can read, change, or destroy your data, and even break your service.

The main problem comes from special React packages, like `react-server-dom-parcel`, `react-server-dom-turbopack`, and `react-server-dom-webpack`. If your project uses these or the affected versions of Next.js, you are in danger. The bug also affects some early “canary” test versions of Next.js, starting with 14.3.0-canary.77.

To fix the problem, you should update React to at least version 19.0.1 (or higher) and Next.js to one of several patched versions, like 15.0.5 or 16.0.7. If you are using a risky canary version, you should go back to a safe version or update to a fixed release right away.

Many people in the comments are very worried because this bug is easy to use and can cause a lot of harm. Some say it is rare to see a bug with a perfect 10.0 risk score in a popular tool like React or Next.js. Others point out that server-side code is supposed to be more secure, so this bug breaks trust in these frameworks.

Some developers are upset that experimental features like React Server Components are causing big problems for everyone. A few commenters think teams should not use new features in production until they are well-tested. Others blame the fast pace of new releases and the push for new web features, saying this makes software less safe.

Some people share advice on how to check if your app is at risk and how to upgrade safely. A few also thank the team for fixing the issue quickly and for making the details public. Others warn that many companies might not update their code soon enough, leaving users exposed. Finally, some developers are thinking about switching to simpler or older tools that have fewer moving parts and risks.

## Greeting Vocalizations in Domestic Cats Are More Frequent with Male Caregivers

- 原文链接: [Greeting Vocalizations in Domestic Cats Are More Frequent with Male Caregivers](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eth.70033)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46140753)

A new study says cats greet their humans with sounds, like meows, more often when the main caregiver is a man. The research wanted to find out if cats act differently based on the gender of the person they live with.

The scientists watched many cats and their humans at home. They counted how often cats made greeting sounds when their person came into a room. They also checked if the person was a man or a woman and if they were the main caregiver. The results showed that cats used more vocal greetings when the main person taking care of them was male. The study did not say why this happens, but it suggests that cats may change their behavior depending on who cares for them. The researchers think it could be because of the way men and women interact with cats or differences in their voices. Another reason might be that cats learn which behaviors work best to get attention from each person.

In the Hacker News comments, some people found the study interesting and wanted to know more details, like how many cats and people were in the study. Others joked that maybe cats just think men are more likely to feed them treats. Some said that their own cats seem to act the same way, no matter who is around. A few people wondered if men and women respond differently to cats’ meows, which could change how often cats use vocal greetings. One commenter pointed out that cats might meow more at people who talk to them the most. There was also a discussion about how cats are good at reading human behavior and adjusting to get what they want. Some users questioned if the study really proves anything or if it just shows a small difference that could be random. Overall, people liked learning something new about cats, but many wanted clearer answers and more data.

## Show HN: I built a dashboard to compare mortgage rates across 120 credit unions

- 原文链接: [Show HN: I built a dashboard to compare mortgage rates across 120 credit unions](https://finfam.app/blog/credit-union-mortgages)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46139761)

Someone built a dashboard that compares mortgage rates from over 120 credit unions across the United States. The tool is meant to help people see better options when buying or refinancing a home, since credit unions often have lower rates than big banks.

The article explains that credit unions are non-profit and member-owned, so they do not have to spend as much money on marketing as big banks do. Because of this, they can often offer loans with lower interest rates. However, credit union rates are hard to find since they do not advertise much. The dashboard collects rates daily from credit union websites and shows them next to national averages. For example, some 30-year fixed loans from credit unions are listed with rates around 5.49% to 6.16%, which is lower than many big banks.

The dashboard also checks national mortgage rate data from the Federal Reserve for comparison. Some outlier rates are hidden by default to keep the data clean, but users can choose to see them. The creator explains that they built the tool after finding their own bank offered a much higher mortgage rate than a local credit union, even though the loan products were the same. In the U.S., most mortgages are standardized because the government buys them, so the main difference in rates is often due to how much banks spend on advertising.

The article encourages people to use the dashboard to shop around and get quotes from different lenders, because even a small difference in rates can save thousands of dollars. Other tips include protecting your privacy before doing credit checks and using online guides to decide whether to buy, rent, or refinance.

Top comments on Hacker News praise the tool for making credit union rates easier to find. Some users say they saved a lot of money by going with credit unions instead of banks. Others share that credit unions sometimes have special rules about who can join, so not everyone can use every rate shown. Some people wish the dashboard could include more local banks or smaller lenders too. A few commenters discuss how the process of buying a home can be confusing, and they appreciate tools that make it simpler.

Others point out that while credit unions often have the best rates, their online systems or customer service can sometimes be weaker than big banks. Some users ask technical questions about how the data is collected and updated. There are also suggestions for adding more features, like filters for loan type or region.

A few commenters warn that rates can change quickly, and that a good dashboard is only the first step—buyers still need to follow up with lenders directly to get their real rates. Finally, some users thank the creator for being transparent about not taking referral fees or advertising money, which helps them trust the information more.

## Kea DHCP: Modern, open source DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 server

- 原文链接: [Kea DHCP: Modern, open source DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 server](https://www.isc.org/kea/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46142000)

Kea DHCP is a modern, open-source server for giving out IP addresses on networks, replacing the older ISC DHCP server. The article explains why Kea is better, with new features and a design that fits today’s network needs. Kea has a modular setup—separate programs for IPv4, IPv6, and DNS, so you can pick only what you need. You can add more features using “hooks” (small extra programs), and even write your own if you want. 

Kea lets you change its settings online using a REST API—no need to stop and restart the server, unlike the old ISC DHCP. Your network data, like which devices have which IP addresses, can be stored in a database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. This makes it easier to share data between servers or make backups. With the database backend, you can set up high-availability (HA) pairs, so your DHCP service keeps working even if one server fails. There’s also a web dashboard, called Stork, where you can manage and watch over many Kea servers from one place. Stork shows you how many IP addresses are being used, alerts you if you’re running low, and helps manage “host reservations” (giving special addresses to certain devices).

Kea is open-source, runs on Linux, Unix, and MacOS, and you can get pre-built packages for most systems. There’s a migration tool for people switching from ISC DHCP, and support options from community help to paid plans with fast responses. The article also talks about different versions of Kea and Stork, how to join the mailing list, report bugs, or help with the project.

In the comments, many users are happy to see a modern DHCP server with good support for IPv6 and databases. Some say Kea’s modular design is great because you only run what you need, making it lighter and safer. Others like being able to change settings with the API, which fits better into automated setups or big networks. People discuss the Stork dashboard, saying it helps a lot for admins who need to watch many servers at once.

A few users are worried about the complexity of using databases, saying that for small networks, simple files might be easier. Some wish more of the advanced features were free, since a few are only in paid versions. There are comments about the migration from ISC DHCP—some found it smooth, while others had to make manual fixes. A couple of users remember times when DHCP servers crashed and praise Kea’s high-availability options. One person points out that Kea is written in C++, so it’s fast, but another warns that this means you have to be careful with updates and security. Finally, many agree that open-source and good documentation make Kea a strong choice for network admins today.
