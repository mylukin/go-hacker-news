The article "Your Startup Doesn’t Need to Be a Unicorn" talks about a different way to grow a startup. Instead of aiming for huge growth and becoming a "unicorn," the author, Matt, suggests a middle path. He shares his own experience with his company, Vizzly, which he sold to a large advertising company. He realized that not getting a big seed round was actually good because it made his company focus on making money right away.

Matt explains that startups usually follow two main paths: either raising a lot of venture capital to grow fast or bootstrapping, which means growing slowly with money the founders put in themselves. But he suggests a third way: raise a small amount of money, keep most of your company, and focus on making it profitable. This way, you don't have to give up control to investors, and you can still have a successful exit.

In the Hacker News comments, people shared different views. Some liked the idea of a middle path, mentioning similar models in Germany where small businesses get support without needing to become huge. However, they also noted that bureaucracy can make starting a business there tough. Others pointed out that while this approach sounds good, it's not always easy to find investors willing to settle for smaller returns. They also mentioned that having a big name like YC (Y Combinator) helps in attracting investors. Some commenters argued that many small businesses already follow this "middle path" naturally, but they don't get as much attention as startups aiming to become unicorns. Overall, the discussion highlighted a mix of optimism about different startup paths and skepticism about the practical challenges.
