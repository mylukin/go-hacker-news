- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43606315)

The article talks about a problem at the NIH (National Institutes of Health). Some top scientists were fired because of a "coding error." Later, they were called back to work.

The main points are: Ten scientists from the NIH were told to leave their jobs. This happened because of a computer mistake. The mistake was in choosing which workers to fire at government offices. The scientists were told they could come back to work. But they are not officially back yet. The people in charge are trying to fix the problem for the long term. The error happened because of confusing data in the human resources department. This mistake also happened at other government offices.

In the comments, people shared different views. One person said it seems like the organization is trying to look good by bringing back famous scientists. Another person thinks if you are near retirement, you might not want to return to work after this. Some people believe the problem is not just a coding error. They think the firings were done without careful thought. Someone else said the whole situation looks like it was handled poorly and that the explanation of a "coding error" is just an excuse. Another comment mentioned that big mistakes like this show a lack of responsibility in leadership. Some people think the issue is political and not just about a simple mistake.

## Data centers contain 90% crap data

- 原文链接: [Data centers contain 90% crap data](https://gerrymcgovern.com/data-centers-contain-90-crap-data/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43605695)

The article is about how most data in data centers is useless and harms the environment. 

The main points are that we create and store a lot of unnecessary data, like photos, videos, and emails, which we never use again. This data takes up space and resources, harming the environment. The writer has worked with many big organizations and found that over 90% of their data is not needed. The rise of digital storage made this problem worse because it became easy and cheap to store data without thinking about its usefulness.

In the comments, some people agree that we store too much useless data. One person says we keep data because we might need it later, like photos or business records. Another person mentions that keeping some data is necessary for legal reasons. Someone else says deleting data can be hard and costly, so we end up keeping everything. A few people argue that storing data is not as harmful to the environment as the article claims. Others mention personal experiences with data storage, like having many photos they never look at, but they do not consider them useless. Some people think the article's tone is too harsh and that people should decide for themselves what data is important.

## Reinventing Feathering for the Vectorian Era

- 原文链接: [Reinventing Feathering for the Vectorian Era](https://rive.app/blog/how-rive-reinvented-feathering-for-the-vectorian-era)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43577338)

The article talks about a new way to make soft edges, glows, and shadows in vector graphics using the Rive Renderer. It explains how they created a system that is better than the old way which used Gaussian blur.

The main points are: Traditional Gaussian blur is not good for vector graphics because it is slow and not scalable. Rive decided to fix this by creating a system where soft edges are part of the vector shape itself. This means no extra steps to blur images, saving time and resources. The new method keeps everything in vector form, so it can scale to any size without losing quality.

In the comments, some people discuss how Gaussian blur can be made faster by using two 1D processes instead of a 2D process. This method is faster because it reduces the amount of work needed. Another person shared a link to a document about fast box blur, which is another way to make blurs more efficient. A commenter found this information interesting and new to them.

The article is about airline safety videos becoming like big movies with famous people and fun settings. Airlines now spend a lot of money on these videos to make them exciting and interesting.

The article explains how safety videos have changed over the years. Airlines use famous people and cool places to make the videos fun. They want people to watch and remember the airline. Some videos are like short movies and get millions of views online. Airlines think these videos help make people like their brand more. But some experts say the videos are so entertaining that people forget important safety information.

In the comments, people share different thoughts. Some think the videos are too long and a waste of money. Others enjoy the fun and creative videos, like those from Virgin America. Some people prefer simple and clear videos without actors. One person wonders if making everything like an ad makes people stop paying attention. Another person says they feel more interested when flight attendants show safety steps in person. Some commenters like funny or catchy videos because they help them remember the information. Overall, people have mixed feelings about the new style of safety videos.

- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43605751)

The article talks about a website called SciOp that lets people download and share files from erased US government websites and datasets. 

The main points include that these files are available as torrents, which are a way to download large files by sharing parts of them with others. The site lists many different files, such as those from NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) and NASA. These files are important because they come from government sources, and some of them might not be available anymore.

In the comments, some people ask if this website is real because the file names look strange. One person, WarOnPrivacy, confirms it is real and says they are sharing (or "seeding") about 30 terabytes of the data. Another person, spiritplumber, asks what software they can use on a Raspberry Pi to share these files. Madphilosopher suggests using a program called Transmission, and x3n0ph3n3 suggests using rtorrent with a web interface called rutorrent. These programs help manage and control the sharing of files using torrents.

The article talks about using genetic programming, a way to solve problems by letting computer programs evolve, like in nature. The author shares their first experience with genetic programming using Common Lisp, a programming language. They write code to create random programs and test them to find solutions, showing how they evolved these programs to solve a math problem.

The author explains genetic programming as inspired by biological evolution. They use Lisp to generate random code. This code evolves over time to solve a problem. The method involves creating random functions and testing them to see which ones work best. The article gives examples of code and explains how they test and improve these codes. The author also talks about challenges like code becoming too complex (bloat) and gives suggestions for improvement.

In the comments, people have different opinions. Some say genetic programming is not very popular now, while others think it is useful for certain problems, like logistics and car design. One person mentions it helps understand results better than machine learning, which often works like a "black box."
