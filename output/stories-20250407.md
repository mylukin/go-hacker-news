- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43609242)

The article talks about how startups don't need to be big companies, called unicorns, to be successful. It shares a story of building a company without following the usual big-money path.

The main points are about finding a middle way for startups. Instead of trying to get a lot of money from investors or using personal savings, you can raise a small amount of money and keep most of the company ownership. This way, you build a company that makes money and is valuable, without the pressure of becoming a very big company. This approach is not common because it doesn't fit the usual investment model, but it can be a good choice for many founders.

In the comments, people shared different views. Some like the idea of small, steady growth like in Germany, where small companies grow slowly but surely. Others think the paperwork and rules in Germany make it hard to start a business. Some say it's easier in the US. People also talked about how the idea of a startup can be different. Some think startups should grow fast and become very big, while others believe it's okay to stay small and successful. Some comments mentioned that many companies try too hard to be unicorns and fail, and it's important to find what works best for you and your goals.

- 原文链接: [DeepMind program finds diamonds in Minecraft without being taught](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01019-w)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43584015)

The article talks about a computer program by DeepMind that can find diamonds in the game Minecraft. The program, called Dreamer, learns to do this without being directly taught by humans.

The main points of the article are about how Dreamer works. It learns by trying different things in the game and seeing what works best. This is called reinforcement learning. Dreamer builds a picture in its "mind" of the game world and uses this to make decisions. It’s like the program can "imagine" the future. Dreamer was tested in Minecraft because the game is very random and different each time, which helps researchers see if the program can learn and adapt.

In the comments, many people have different opinions. Some are impressed by Dreamer's ability to learn without being shown videos or given direct instructions. Others think that the program still needed a lot of help, like being given rewards for each step it completed. Some people talk about how games are easier for AI because they have clear goals, unlike the real world. One person mentions that humans also needed help learning Minecraft when it first came out. Others discuss how AI might do well in virtual tasks but still struggles with real-world physical tasks. Some comments focus on how the program's learning is still directed by humans through rewards, which means it isn't fully independent. Overall, there is a mix of excitement and skepticism about AI's progress.

## Reinventing Feathering for the Vectorian Era

- 原文链接: [Reinventing Feathering for the Vectorian Era](https://rive.app/blog/how-rive-reinvented-feathering-for-the-vectorian-era)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43577338)

The article talks about a new way to make soft edges (feathering) in computer graphics using vectors. This method is different from the old way, which uses a Gaussian blur, because it is faster and keeps the image as a vector, not turning it into pixels.

The main points are: Gaussian blur is slow and not designed for making soft edges in graphics. The new method uses math directly on vector shapes to create soft edges without turning them into pixels first. This makes the images look good at any size and is faster for computers to process. The new system allows designers to have more freedom and make changes in real-time, which was difficult with the old method.

In the comments, some people wanted more technical details instead of the promotional parts of the article. Others talked about different ways to achieve similar effects, like using 1D blurs instead of 2D, which can be faster. Some were not sure if the new method is really better or just as slow. One person mentioned that the new method seems faster than traditional web or design tools. Another person asked if a simple gradient could do the same job, but others explained that the math is more complex for different shapes. Finally, one person made a joke about thinking the article was about a history topic because of the word "feathering."

## A Multiwavelength Look at Proxima Centauri's Flares

- 原文链接: [A Multiwavelength Look at Proxima Centauri's Flares](https://www.centauri-dreams.org/2025/04/01/a-multiwavelength-look-at-proxima-centauris-flares/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43565891)

The article is about flares from a star named Proxima Centauri. These flares can be dangerous for planets near the star because they might take away the planet's atmosphere.

The article explains that Proxima Centauri is a small star called an M-dwarf. These stars have flares because their energy moves to the surface like boiling water. This can create strong magnetic fields that cause flares. Scientists used a telescope called ALMA to study these flares. They looked at 463 flare events and found that small flares happen very often.

In the comments, people discuss if planets around small stars can have life. One person doubts that a strong magnetic field can protect planets from flares. Another person thinks we need better technology to study planets' atmospheres. Someone else wonders why we have not found radio signals from other civilizations if there are so many stars. They mention that there are many stars with possible Earth-like planets, so there might be many chances for life. Some say we might not detect other civilizations' signals unless they aim directly at us. Another commenter points out the universe is very old and civilizations might have existed and disappeared before we could find them.

## Data centers contain 90% crap data

- 原文链接: [Data centers contain 90% crap data](https://gerrymcgovern.com/data-centers-contain-90-crap-data/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43605695)

The article talks about data centers storing a lot of unnecessary data, which the author calls "crap data." The author worries that this is bad for the environment. He says that 90% of the data in commercial and government systems is useless and should not be stored. He gives examples of websites and organizations with huge amounts of data that nobody ever looks at. The author believes this problem got worse with cloud storage, making it too easy and cheap to keep unimportant data.

In the comments, some people agree with the author, saying that too much unnecessary data is stored because storage is cheap. Others think we keep data because we might need it later, like old photos or business records. Some people say that deleting data is hard and time-consuming, so it’s easier to keep everything. A few commenters mention that storing lots of data is not as bad for the environment compared to other industries, like manufacturing. They think the real problem is how much energy is used for computing, not just storing data.

Some people suggest that better systems are needed to manage data, like automatic deletion after a certain time. Others say that the cost of keeping data should include environmental impacts, which might make people more careful about what they store. A few commenters think that everyone has different ideas about what data is important, so it’s hard to decide what to delete. Overall, there are mixed opinions on whether keeping so much data is really a problem and what should be done about it.
