## How can AI ID a cat?

- 原文链接: [How can AI ID a cat?](https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-can-ai-id-a-cat-an-illustrated-guide-20250430/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44964800)

This article explains how computers use AI to tell if a picture has a cat in it. It says people can see a cat easily, but teaching a computer to do this is hard.

First, the article talks about how neural networks work. Neural networks are made of simple parts called “neurons.” Each neuron takes some numbers in and gives one number out. The output is usually close to 0 or 1. Each neuron has weights and a bias, which control how it reacts to inputs. To teach a neuron, you give it many examples and change the weights and bias each time it gets an answer wrong. This is called training. 

A simple example is using a neuron to decide if a point is in one area or another on a map, like “Triangle Territory” or “Square State.” The neuron draws a line between the two areas. If the neuron makes a mistake, an algorithm changes its line a little. After many tries, it can tell which side of the line a point is on.

But cats in photos are much more complex than points on a map. So, AI uses many neurons together, in layers, to make a neural network. Each neuron in a layer takes in numbers and passes results to the next layer. More neurons and layers mean the network can make more complex decisions, like finding the “cat” area in a very high-dimensional space.

A small picture might use 2,500 pixels, so each cat photo is a point in a 2,500-dimensional space. The network learns to draw a boundary around the “cat” area in this space. After training, the AI can look at a new picture and say if it is a cat or not. The same idea can be used to tell other objects apart, not just cats.

Neural networks are now used for many things, like language models (for example, ChatGPT), games, and science problems. These networks can have billions of parts, making them hard to fully understand.

In the comments, some people like how the article uses simple examples, like maps, to explain hard ideas. Others say the high-dimensional spaces are hard to imagine, but the map example helps. A few readers point out that real cat pictures can be messy—different backgrounds, lighting, and shapes—so real networks need lots of training data. Some worry that even with training, neural networks can still make mistakes if the picture is strange or confusing. One person says that neural networks do not really “understand” cats, they just find patterns. Another commenter notes that neural networks are powerful because they learn from data, not from rules made by people. Some users share that they have used similar ideas when building their own image classifiers. Others wonder if we will ever fully understand how big neural networks make decisions. A few say that while AI works well for cats, it can fail in new or unusual situations. Some people are excited about how neural networks are used in fields like medicine and science. Others feel that the “black box” nature of neural networks is a problem for trust and safety.

## Line scan camera image processing for train photography

- 原文链接: [Line scan camera image processing for train photography](https://daniel.lawrence.lu/blog/y2025m09d21/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44996938)

This article is about how the author uses a line scan camera to take very detailed photos of trains as they pass by. The camera works by staying still while trains move in front of it, recording one thin slice at a time to build a long, high-resolution image.

The camera has only two columns of pixels and scans very quickly. It’s great for trains because you can capture the whole length with almost no distortion, making it useful for train fans and model builders. The process starts with a lot of raw data, mostly background, so the author uses a special “energy function” to find which parts have moving objects like trains. This is tricky, as things like waving leaves can confuse the system.

To estimate how fast the train is moving (important for making the image look right), the author compares the two green channels in the camera’s Bayer sensor. This is a noisy process, so they divide the image into sections and use a mathematical method called mean shift to find the best match. The result is a curve (spline) that tells how to space each part of the image to avoid stretching or squishing.

For each part, the author uses a Hann window to sample the data, which makes the images clearer, especially when details move quickly, like LED signs. Demosaicing (turning the raw sensor data into color images) is done carefully to avoid color fringing, using bilinear interpolation. Vertical stripes in the images, caused by camera timing errors, are removed by fitting a model with linear regression, then smoothing.

Noise is reduced with a patch-based denoiser that looks for repeated patterns along the rows, helpful since trains have many repeated features. Skew correction is planned to fix images when the camera isn’t perfectly vertical, using a Hough transform. Color calibration is done mostly by eye, but it looks fine.

The code is written in Python with numpy, but files are so big they have to be processed in parts. The author tried using AI for coding help, but found AI-generated code was often too slow or used too much memory, though AI was useful for some tasks like plotting.

Finally, the article mentions other people doing similar work: Adam Magyar, who takes line scan photos in subways with better low-light cameras, and a Japanese blog with many train photos using film.

In the comments, some readers are amazed by the high quality and technical detail of the images. Others are interested in the specific camera used and ask how expensive or difficult it is to get started with line scan photography. A few point out that similar scanning tech is used in other fields, like racing or medical imaging. Some suggest alternative ways to process or denoise the data, such as trying different filters or machine learning. One reader mentions how tricky color calibration can be, especially outdoors.

People also discuss the use of AI in coding, agreeing that AI can be helpful for simple tasks but often struggles with large, complex data or efficient algorithms. Some share their own experiences with memory issues when handling big images in Python and give tips on chunking or using other libraries. There are questions about whether this method could work for other fast-moving subjects, like cars or wildlife. A few readers share links to similar train photography projects and discuss how scanning cameras have changed over time.

Lastly, some express nostalgia for old film-based strip cameras and wonder if digital methods can fully match their unique look. Others invite the author to share more code and examples, hoping to try line scan photography themselves.

## Static sites with Python, uv, Caddy, and Docker

- 原文链接: [Static sites with Python, uv, Caddy, and Docker](https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/static-python-uv-caddy-docker/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44985653)

This article talks about how to build and serve static sites using Python, uv, Caddy, and Docker. The author explains their preferred way to set up and deploy simple websites that are fast and easy to maintain.

The main idea is to use uv, a tool that manages Python versions and runs scripts, to build the static site inside a Docker container. The Dockerfile starts with a special image that has uv, sets a working directory, copies the code, installs Python 3.13 with uv, and runs the build process. This process creates the static site files in a folder called /output.

Next, the Dockerfile switches to a new image based on Caddy, a modern web server. It copies the Caddy configuration file (Caddyfile) and the static site files from the build step into the right places in the container. When the container runs, Caddy serves the static files to the web.

The Caddyfile is shown and explained. It lists all the site domains and ports, points Caddy to the folder with the static files, and sets up a file server. There is also a rule to help with privacy-friendly analytics by passing some requests to Plausible Analytics. Other tips include how to make custom error pages, set content types for certain paths, and set up redirects.

The author says this setup is simple, fast, and works well. They want to make it even easier in the future by using just build commands everywhere.

In the Hacker News comments, some people like the clear and simple approach for static sites, especially using Docker and Caddy together. A few users praise uv for making Python projects faster and easier to manage. Others point out that using containers for static sites might be overkill and suggest that direct file hosting or simple platforms like Netlify or Vercel could be easier for many use cases. Some commenters note that Caddy’s automatic HTTPS is a big advantage. There are questions about how scalable this setup is for bigger sites, and a few people wonder how much overhead Docker adds when just serving static files. One person suggests that for small projects, this stack is nice because it’s easy to copy and reuse. Another commenter warns that adding too many tools can make things harder for beginners. Some are curious about Plausible Analytics and how the proxying works with Caddy. Overall, the discussion is positive, with people sharing their favorite ways to serve static sites and talking about when this setup makes sense.

## A 2k-year-old sun hat worn by a Roman soldier in Egypt

- 原文链接: [A 2k-year-old sun hat worn by a Roman soldier in Egypt](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/a-2000-year-old-sun-hat-worn-by-a-roman-soldier-in-egypt-goes-on-view-after-a-century-in-storage-180987192/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44998514)

A new discovery shows that Roman soldiers wore sun hats in Egypt about 2,000 years ago. The article talks about a rare, well-kept hat found by archaeologists, showing how soldiers protected themselves from the hot sun.

The hat is made from plant fibers, tightly woven together. It looks like a wide-brimmed straw hat, much like hats used today for gardening or working outside. The hat was found in a Roman fort in Egypt, where the sun is very strong. Historians say soldiers usually wore metal helmets, but in hot places like Egypt, helmets could be uncomfortable and dangerous in the heat. Wearing a sun hat helped soldiers avoid sunburn and heatstroke. The article says this hat is special because few ancient clothes survive for so long. The dry desert helped keep the hat in good shape. Experts believe this shows Roman soldiers were practical and changed their clothing for the local weather. The hat tells us that Roman army life was different in Egypt than in cooler parts of the empire.

In the comments, some people are surprised to see a “modern-looking” hat from ancient times. Others say it makes sense—people have always needed sun protection. Some commenters point out that the Romans were good at adapting to different places. A few say that finding a simple thing like a hat can teach us a lot about daily life back then. There is also talk about how rare it is to find old, normal clothes because most things rot away. Some think it’s fun to imagine Roman soldiers looking like gardeners. Others wonder if the soldiers missed their helmets or liked the hats better. A few people share stories about sun hats in their own lives, saying not much has changed in 2,000 years. Some ask if the army had rules for these hats, or if soldiers made their own. Lastly, a few wonder what other surprises are still buried in the desert.

## Acronis True Image costs performance when not used

- 原文链接: [Acronis True Image costs performance when not used](https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2025/05/26/acronis-true-image-costs-performance-when-not-used/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44960718)

This article talks about how leaving Acronis True Image software installed, even when not using it, can slow down your Windows computer. The writer noticed that after plugging or unplugging an external monitor, Windows Explorer (explorer.exe) would use a lot of CPU and make the computer slow for about 15 seconds.

The author used special tools to check what was happening. They found that a DLL from Acronis (called tishell64) was being called thousands of times whenever the monitor was plugged or unplugged. This DLL would get a list of running processes over and over again, which wasted a lot of CPU time. Sometimes, it could use up to 60 seconds of CPU time just from this activity.

The problem got worse if more Explorer windows were open or if there were many files showing. The author also found that many DLLs loaded by Explorer had missing version information, which made things look unprofessional and harder to debug.

The root cause was a shell extension added by Acronis True Image, which kept running in the background and did unnecessary work even if you weren’t using the program. The author contacted Acronis, and they said they would fix this in the next version. For now, you can turn off the bad behavior by deleting a registry key or just uninstalling Acronis True Image, which the author recommends.

Some extra technical notes: the wasteful process involved Windows functions called CreateToolhelp32Snapshot and Process32NextW. These should not be called so often, especially just when plugging in a monitor. The author also noticed many strange exceptions and errors in Explorer.exe while debugging, which was surprising.

In the Hacker News comments, many people agreed this was a common problem with backup or migration software—they often leave behind shell extensions or background tasks that slow down the system. Some users shared stories about uninstalling old software and seeing big speed improvements. Others said Windows should do more to limit or warn about shell extensions that hurt performance.

A few commenters pointed out that some antivirus and hardware tools do similar things, so it’s not just Acronis. There was debate about whether it’s better to remove these tools after use or keep them "just in case." Some users asked why Windows Explorer allows third-party DLLs to run in the first place, saying this design can cause lots of trouble.

One commenter mentioned using Process Explorer or Autoruns from Microsoft Sysinternals to track down and disable extra shell extensions. Another said the missing version information in DLLs is sloppy and makes debugging much harder. A few people were surprised that unplugging a monitor could even trigger so much background work.

Overall, the main feeling was that users should be careful about leaving extra software installed, especially tools that add shell extensions. Even if you are not using them, they can slow down your computer and waste battery life. Most people agreed it’s best to uninstall these programs once you don’t need them anymore.

## Librebox: An open source, Roblox-compatible game engine

- 原文链接: [Librebox: An open source, Roblox-compatible game engine](https://github.com/librebox-devs/librebox-demo)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44995147)

Librebox is a new, open-source game engine that can run games made for Roblox using the Luau scripting language. It tries to copy Roblox’s Public API so that Roblox games and scripts can work on Librebox without big changes. The project is not from Roblox and does not use any Roblox code or assets.

Librebox is at the demo stage now. It can render simple game scenes, show lighting and shadows, and has a basic camera system. You can create “parts” (3D objects), set their color and position, and make them move or change during gameplay. The engine supports some Roblox data types, like CFrame, Vector3, and Color3, and core services, such as Workspace and RunService. You can write scripts in Luau to control the game, use events, and run tasks with coroutines. Right now, it only works on Windows, but because it uses raylib (a cross-platform library), it could run on other systems in the future. The project plans to add more features soon, like physics, player support, user input, GUIs, and more advanced rendering. The creators want people to own their games fully, use their own code, and maybe even set up their own game servers like Minecraft.

Many Hacker News commenters are excited about Librebox. Some say it will help developers avoid problems with Roblox’s rules and monetization. Others like that it is open source and copyright free, so you can control and share your own games. A few users ask about how complete the API is and point out that some big features like physics and multiplayer are missing for now. Some worry that Roblox might try to block or change their API to stop outside projects. There are questions about how well Roblox games will really work on Librebox, since perfect compatibility is hard. Some developers are hopeful Librebox will become like Godot for Roblox games, giving creators more freedom. A few people wonder if it could help kids learn programming in a safer, more open environment. Others think the project will need help and more users to grow, but they like the direction it is going.

- 原文链接: [Motion (YC W20) Is Hiring Senior Software Engineers](https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/motion/7355e80d-dab2-4ba1-89cc-a0197e08a83c?utm_source=hn)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44999094)

Motion is looking for senior software engineers to help build AI-powered project management tools that let one person handle much more work. The company says AI will soon do most tasks, but humans are still needed for big decisions and strategy.

Motion has spent years making software that predicts project timelines, assigns tasks, and keeps work moving without people having to react to problems. Their system keeps all work, meetings, and communication in one place, which gives them an edge when using AI. The company believes having all this user data means their AI can act more like a real assistant.

Backed by Y Combinator and Sam Altman, with a high valuation and many users, Motion is growing fast. They want engineers who can take on big projects, work quickly, learn new tech, and focus on what really helps customers. The team is experienced, and new hires will face high standards, lots of feedback, and chances to learn from others.

The tech stack includes TypeScript, Node.js, React, Nest.js, Postgres, and Temporal. They prefer people familiar with JavaScript tools but expect fast learners. The job is remote for North America and Canada, with a high salary and total pay package, plus visa support if needed.

Motion’s culture is intense and fast, not a normal 9–5 job. They highlight diversity, respect, and learning. The company also shares videos about their work style and engineering culture.

In the Hacker News comments, some users are surprised by the high salary range, with a few saying this is rare outside top tech firms. Others wonder if the intense work culture means burnout or long hours, and some share concerns about work-life balance. A few commenters praise Motion’s focus on AI and say the product could save teams a lot of time. One user points out that having all project data in one place is risky if the company ever has problems, while another says this integration is what makes the tool powerful. Some ask how much of the product is really AI versus automation. Others debate whether such high expectations are fair, or if they will attract only certain types of engineers. Overall, people think the job is exciting for those who want to work hard and learn quickly, but not for everyone.

## RFC 9839 and Bad Unicode

- 原文链接: [RFC 9839 and Bad Unicode](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/08/14/RFC9839)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44995640)

RFC 9839 is a new standard that tells software builders which Unicode characters are “bad” and should not be allowed in text fields. The article explains why not all Unicode characters are safe to use, even though Unicode itself is very useful.

The author gives an example with a JSON “username” field that contains four strange Unicode code points: a null character, a C1 control code, an unpaired surrogate, and a noncharacter. These all can cause big problems—some can break software, others don’t mean anything, and a few are just not allowed to be sent in data.

RFC 9839 lists and explains these “problematic” code points. It also describes three sets (“subsets”) of better, safer Unicode characters you can choose for your project. If you build things like APIs or file formats, you should read RFC 9839—it’s short and made for developers.

The article says older standards, like PRECIS (RFC 8264), already tried to solve this, but they are long, hard to understand, and not used much. PRECIS is also tied to a specific version of Unicode, which makes updates tricky. RFC 9839 is simpler, so more people might actually use it.

The author also shares a small Go library to check text fields against the RFC 9839 rules. He shows a table summarizing how different data formats (like JSON, XML, YAML) handle these problematic characters—most do not block all the bad ones.

Finally, the author thanks many people who helped improve the RFC and says writing an RFC alone (not with a group) is very hard work.

In the comments, some people are happy this RFC exists, saying it’s long needed. Others point out that Unicode is too complex, and wish things were simpler. Several users talk about real bugs they’ve seen caused by bad Unicode characters, especially in usernames or logs. Some wonder why formats like JSON didn’t block these characters from the start. There’s worry that not all programming languages handle these cases the same, so bugs still happen.

One commenter says older standards like PRECIS are too hard for normal developers, so they never get used. A few people like the Go library, saying it will help them right away. Some raise questions about how to handle new Unicode updates and emoji. Others wish the standard was even stricter, or ask how to update old software to follow these new rules. There are also jokes about how weird Unicode is, and how hard it is to get right. Overall, people agree that clear, simple rules for Unicode are important for safer, better software.

## Children of the Geissler Tube

- 原文链接: [Children of the Geissler Tube](https://www.hopefulmons.com/p/children-of-the-geissler-tube)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44962077)

The article talks about the Geissler tube, a simple glass tube invented in the 1800s that could glow when electricity passed through gas inside it. At first, these tubes were just fun science toys, but they became very important for science and technology.

Geissler tubes were made by Heinrich Geißler, a skilled glassblower in Germany. He worked with scientists to create a vacuum pump and made tubes that could hold low-pressure gas. When electricity was added, the gas would glow in different colors. People liked these for their pretty lights, and companies sold them in many shapes. Some tubes even used special green uranium glass that glowed under light.

These glowing tubes weren’t just for fun. They led to many new inventions. Scientists used them to discover the electron, which is a tiny part of atoms, by watching the light in the tubes. They also helped discover X-rays, which we now use to look inside the body.

Over time, Geissler tubes became the base for many kinds of lights: fluorescent lights in schools, bright neon signs in cities, sodium street lamps, and even strong xenon lamps for cameras and projectors. The tubes were improved, like the Crookes tube, to do more science. Later, these ideas led to the cathode-ray tube (CRT), which was used in old TVs and computer screens.

The tube’s biggest impact was in electronics. By changing the tube to let electricity flow in only one way, inventors made the first diodes and then triodes. These “vacuum tubes” were used in all early radios, TVs, and computers, like the famous ENIAC. Only when transistors were invented did people stop using so many vacuum tubes.

So, even though most people today have never heard of the Geissler tube, almost every modern electronic device can trace its history back to this little glowing glass tube from 170 years ago.

In the comments, many people were surprised at how important the Geissler tube was. Some said they had seen these tubes in science museums but didn’t know their history. A few shared stories about making or fixing old vacuum tube devices, saying they loved the warm glow and the “science fiction” look.

Others pointed out that many key inventions often start as toys or curiosities, not as serious technology. Some found it funny that what started as a pretty lamp ended up powering TVs and computers. There was debate over whether the Geissler tube or the transistor was more important; some argued both were needed for progress.

A few commenters talked about how modern tech often hides its roots, and it’s easy to forget the simple inventions behind today’s gadgets. Some wished schools would teach more about these “hidden” heroes of tech history. Others said it was a shame that most people don’t know about Geissler’s work, even though we all benefit from it. Finally, someone mentioned they now look at old neon signs and tube TVs with more respect, knowing the long story behind them.
