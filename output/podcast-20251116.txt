Hello everyone, this is the 2025-11-16 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we bring you news and discussions from the world of software, open source, privacy, security, and AI. Let’s get started.

First, let’s talk about Zigbook, a new open-source book for learning the Zig programming language. Zigbook has 61 chapters and is project-based, focusing not just on syntax but on teaching you how to think like a Zig developer. It’s interactive, runs in your terminal, and is written fully by humans—no AI-generated content. The author wants you to learn by doing real projects, with every step explained clearly. Many in the community are excited, saying Zig needs more learning resources and praising the personal touch and interactivity. Some hope it will help Zig grow, while others suggest adding more examples and worry about updates as Zig changes. Overall, people are thankful for this free, open resource.

Next, there’s a discussion about the value of small open source libraries in the age of AI. The author of blob-util notes that AI tools now generate utility code on demand, often using code learned from these small libraries. This saves time but may mean fewer people read docs or learn from open source. Some commenters worry that AI-generated code is messy and can lead to technical debt, while others say it’s just normal progress. Many agree that open source is still important, especially for big or creative projects that AI can’t easily copy. There’s also concern that losing small libraries could hurt code quality and developer growth, but some see it as a chance for developers to add value in new ways.

Now, let’s look at a privacy issue involving favicons—the small icons in your browser tabs. A project called “supercookie” shows that websites can use favicons to track users, even in private browsing mode. Browsers store these icons in a special cache that’s hard to clear. By checking which favicons you already have, a site can create a unique pattern to identify you, even if you delete cookies or use a VPN. This method works in all major browsers, including mobile. Many in the comments are shocked and worried, saying browser makers should fix this. Tips to clear the cache exist but are hard for most users. Some debate if this is practical for big trackers or just a proof of concept, but most agree it’s a wake-up call for privacy.

Next, we cover Heretic, a tool that can remove safety or censorship filters from large language models. Heretic uses a method called “directional ablation” to change how models answer blocked prompts, making the process automatic and easy for anyone with Python and a GPU. The tool is open source and works with many model types. In the comments, people debate the ethics—some worry it could be used for harm, while others say open-source models can always be changed anyway. There’s also discussion about technical details, detection, and practical use. Some warn that using decensored models could get users banned from hosting sites. Overall, the community is split: some fear abuse, others value research and free speech, but all see it as a strong technical achievement.

Moving on, there’s a new website called DarkPattern.games, which helps people find mobile games that avoid tricks designed to make you play or spend more than you want. The site lists different types of “dark patterns,” like daily rewards, social pressure, pay-to-win, and tricks that play with your mind. It ranks games by how healthy or dark they are and invites users to leave reviews. Many in the comments are happy to see this, saying it’s getting harder to find fair games. Some developers explain they feel forced to add these tricks to survive. Others hope that talking about the issue will help players make better choices and push game makers to be more fair.

Next, we have a review of the 20th Anniversary Edition of "The Pragmatic Programmer," a classic book for software developers. The new edition adds advice on security, concurrency, and real-world skills like working with users and requirements. The book’s main tips include using version control, not living with broken code, keeping things simple, and always learning. Many commenters say the book helped them early in their careers and still recommend it for new developers. Some feel parts of it are now common sense, while others debate which tips are most useful. A few warn against following every rule too strictly, but most agree it’s still a valuable book.

Now let’s talk about Z3, a popular tool for solving math and logic problems with Python. The article shows how to define variables, add constraints, and get solutions—even for puzzles like Sudoku or Eight Queens. Z3 can also help with real-world problems, like checking software or managing dependencies. The Hacker News community is impressed by Z3’s power and how easy it is to model problems in code. Some users share their own scripts and tips. Others note that Z3 can be slow on very big problems and that its docs can be hard to read at first. Overall, people like how Z3 teaches logical thinking and suggest starting simple before trying harder problems.

Next, there’s an article on using Bash scripts instead of big MCP servers for browser automation with AI agents. The author explains that small scripts using Node.js and Puppeteer can do tasks like starting the browser, navigating to URLs, running JavaScript, and taking screenshots. These scripts are easy to change and compose, making them faster and easier to maintain than large frameworks. Many commenters prefer this simple approach, saying it follows the Unix style of small tools. Some warn that handling browser profiles and cookies can be risky. Others note that big MCP servers still help for complex team projects, but for most tasks, scripts are enough.

Now, for a story about a Coinbase data breach that happened months before it was officially announced. The author received a scam call with detailed private account info in January 2025 and reported it to Coinbase, but got no follow-up. Coinbase only went public about the breach in May 2025, after attackers tried to extort them. The breach involved overseas support staff being bribed for access to customer data. Many in the comments are shocked that Coinbase ignored such a clear warning and worry about poor controls and lack of transparency. Some argue that keeping large amounts of crypto on exchanges is risky. Most agree that big companies should pay more attention to security and user reports.

Finally, there’s an article on Cloudflare Zero Trust tunnels and why the author switched from Tailscale to Cloudflare for networking. Cloudflare’s system lets you connect private networks and control access without firewall headaches. Tunnels act as secure entry points, and the Warp client enforces access rules. Some in the comments prefer Tailscale for speed and simplicity, but agree Cloudflare is useful for complex setups. Others worry about trusting a single provider, but like the fine-grained access controls. There’s interest in more guides and examples, especially for mixing both tools in the same network.

That’s all for today’s episode. We hope you enjoyed these stories and discussions from Hacker News. Thank you for listening, and see you next time.
