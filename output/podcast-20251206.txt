Hello everyone, this is the 2025-12-06 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we bring you a wide mix of stories from the world of software, hardware, AI, and technology communities.

First, let’s talk about Tiny Core Linux. This is a very small Linux system that gives you a working desktop in just 23 MB. It starts with only the Linux kernel and basic files, and you add more by installing small packages called extensions. The main version uses FLTK and FLWM for its window system, and has basic tools like a terminal and app bar. If you want something even smaller, there is “Core” with no desktop at only 11 MB, and “CorePlus” if you want to pick your own desktop and set up on USB or CD.

Tiny Core Linux is not meant to be a full desktop system out of the box. You need to add what you want yourself. It is good for old computers, small servers, and special devices. The whole system runs in RAM, so it boots very fast. You can also put apps in RAM or on storage, and build your own extensions. The project is open and welcomes new people.

In the comments, many users are surprised by how small and fast Tiny Core is. Some like it for old laptops, others for fast boot times. There are stories about using it for servers or home projects. Some say it’s not easy for beginners, since you must know a bit about Linux. People compare it to other small Linux systems, saying Tiny Core is one of the smallest, but maybe not the easiest to use. There are questions about hardware support, with tips on adding drivers or using wired internet if WiFi isn’t supported. Overall, people respect the project, but note it’s best for those who like to build things themselves.

Next, GrapheneOS says it is the only Android-based system giving users all the latest security patches, sometimes months before others. They work hard to release updates quickly, even before Google’s public release. Some patches meant for December 2025 were made optional and pushed back, but GrapheneOS included them early. Most phone makers cannot keep up, so security fixes are often delayed elsewhere.

The team says this fast patching is a lot of work and slows down new features. They are also moving servers and hiring more staff. GrapheneOS is based on Android 16 QPR1, so they move patches from Android 16 to their own version. Soon, other devices besides Google Pixel may get these updates. The team wishes Google would share security fixes with phone makers just one week early, not months, to help close this gap.

In the comments, many thank the GrapheneOS team and plan to donate. Some ask if this makes GrapheneOS less open, since some patches are not public until Google allows it. The team explains they have the code but must wait to share it. Users talk about update notifications and support for new devices. Some share good experiences switching to GrapheneOS. One person reports a bug with displays. Overall, users praise the team’s focus on security and choice.

Now, let’s look at Zebra-Llama, a new way to make large language models, or LLMs, faster and use less memory. Zebra-Llama mixes State Space Models and Multi-head Latent Attention layers, and uses data from old pre-trained transformers. The models come in 1B, 3B, and 8B sizes, and need much less training data—just 7 to 11 billion tokens. They keep almost all the accuracy of transformer models but are much faster and need very little memory for the KV cache, sometimes only 2% of the original.

Zebra-Llama beats other models like MambaInLLaMA and Minitron in memory and speed, and sometimes in accuracy. For example, Zebra-Llama-8B is 7% better in few-shot tasks than Minitron-8B, with eight times less training data. It also runs up to 3.8 times faster. The team plans to release their code soon.

In the comments, users are excited about the memory savings, and say this could bring strong models to phones or small devices. Some want to see more real-world tests, and others are curious about the hybrid approach. There are questions on retraining for special uses, and if this can help keep old models useful. Some are cautious and want to see the open-source code before making big claims. The community is hopeful, but wants proof that Zebra-Llama works well outside the lab.

Georgia Tech is now sharing its Online Master of Science in Computer Science course content for free. The open courseware site lists many graduate-level CS courses, with lecture videos and exercises. Topics include operating systems, AI, machine learning, databases, and more. The content is the same as real OMSCS students use, but does not include graded homework, projects, or exams.

Anyone can browse and learn, making it a good resource for self-study or review. Some courses have extra forums, but these may not be active. The content covers beginner to advanced topics and includes modern areas like deep learning and quantum computing.

In the comments, many are excited to see high-quality material for free. Some say this helps people who cannot afford a full master’s. Others note that real learning comes from doing assignments, which are not included. Some wish more schools would offer this, and compare it to MIT OpenCourseWare. Others mention the lack of certificates or feedback, but most support the idea and hope the content grows.

Let’s move on to Z-Image, a new open-source image generation model with 6 billion parameters. It comes in three versions: Turbo for fast generation, Base for future tuning, and Edit for editing images with natural language. Z-Image-Turbo can make high-quality, photo-like images in less than a second on strong GPUs, and even on normal devices with 16GB VRAM. It is very good at showing Chinese and English text in images, and can follow instructions in both languages. Edit mode lets you change images with text prompts.

The model uses a Scalable Single-Stream DiT architecture, combining text and image information in one stream. For fast generation, Turbo uses only 8 steps, which is much fewer than other models. New training methods, Decoupled-DMD and DMDR, help improve speed and quality. The model is already working with HuggingFace Diffusers and can run with just a few commands.

In tests, Z-Image-Turbo performs as well as or better than many top open-source models. In the comments, users are impressed with the speed and efficiency, and especially the clear bilingual text. Developers are interested in the open-source side and want to try tuning the model. Some ask about image quality compared to other models, and share positive results. There are questions about licensing and commercial use, and some concerns about the environment. Some debate if fast generation is worth the added complexity, but many are excited for text-heavy graphics and creative edits.

arXiv now offers research papers in HTML, not just PDF. This helps make papers easier to read, especially for people with disabilities. Most arXiv papers are written in LaTeX, which is hard to turn into HTML. The new HTML is better for screen readers and phones, but not every paper can be converted yet. Authors can check their papers before publishing, and the project is still in beta.

arXiv asks users to report only important issues, like unreadable text or broken layouts. HTML will look different from PDF, but the goal is better function, not perfect appearance. Authors can help by following best LaTeX practices, and developers can join in to improve the tools.

In the comments, many users praise arXiv for focusing on accessibility. Some say HTML is easier on phones and for screen readers. Others note that converting LaTeX to HTML is very hard, so it’s okay if things are not perfect. Some worry about losing special formatting, but most see this as a positive step, even with some bumps along the way.

There is also an article explaining abstract interpretation in a small toy optimizer for compiler experiments. The method lets you reason about program behavior without running the program, using “abstract values” instead of real ones. The article shows how you can use this to remove checks or optimize code, giving examples with parity (even or odd numbers).

The author gives Python examples and explains how the optimizer simplifies code in a single pass, inspired by the PyPy project. The post also mentions other types of analysis, like constant propagation and range analysis.

In the comments, readers praise the clear explanation, saying it helps make abstract interpretation less scary. Some share real-world experiences, like with LLVM. Others point out that real IRs are more complex, and adding more to the analysis makes the code harder to write, but more powerful. There’s debate about the best tools for analysis, and requests for more examples or even video walk-throughs.

Another article discusses why many people today feel they have autism, even if they might have other conditions. The writer is a psychiatrist and explains that traits like avoiding eye contact or strong routines can appear in anxiety, personality disorders, trauma, or just be normal. Autism is diagnosed based on patterns of behavior, not with medical tests.

Many conditions can look like autism, such as schizoid or obsessive-compulsive personality, social anxiety, or trauma. The article notes that autism is often diagnosed more because it is well known and brings more support. In the comments, people share stories of misdiagnosis, and discuss the rise of self-diagnosis online. Some worry this stretches resources, while others say any diagnosis can help people get support. There’s debate about the fuzzy lines between conditions, and the importance of careful evaluation.

Next, CATL says it will have electric ships crossing oceans in three years. CATL already powers ships on rivers and near the coast, and now wants to make big ships that use only batteries for long trips. They’ve made batteries for ships, cars, and the power grid, and launched systems for easy ship charging and battery swapping. They have worked with big shipping companies, and new battery types like sodium-ion could make electric ships cheaper. Studies show electric ships can go up to 5,000 kilometers now without very heavy batteries.

In the comments, people have mixed views. Some are excited by cleaner shipping. Others doubt if battery ships can really cross oceans soon, saying batteries are heavy and ships need lots of power. Some think electric ships are better for short trips, and hybrid ships might work better for now. There are questions about charging at sea, safety, and the future of new battery types. Some note that changes will take time, but are happy to see progress on cutting pollution.

Finally, there’s a deep look at Google’s Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, which are special chips for machine learning. The article explains that TPUs were built for deep learning, starting with simple chips for inference, then adding training, better memory, and fast connections. Later TPUs added bigger on-chip memory, special parts for sparse data, and complex networks inside data centers. Google’s software compiles and schedules work across thousands of chips, making the whole system feel like one big computer.

In the comments, readers are impressed by the design and scale of TPUs, and how hardware and software are planned together. Some discuss whether TPUs are better than GPUs, and worry about the environmental cost. Others are excited by optical switches and the idea of treating the data center as one computer. There is praise for Google’s open technical papers, and some wish this hardware was more available. Many reflect on how modern computing needs teamwork, planning, and careful trade-offs, not just clever chips.
