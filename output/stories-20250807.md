- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44829185)

The article is about the "Historical Tech Tree," a website that shows when different inventions and discoveries happened in history. The site uses a big, interactive chart to connect inventions, people, and ideas over time, similar to the tech trees you see in games like Civilization.

The main page of the site lets you scroll through history and see how one invention leads to another. For example, you can see that the printing press led to more books, which helped spread new ideas. The chart connects important inventions like the wheel, writing, electricity, and computers. You can click on each item to learn more about why it mattered and what came after. The website also shows famous inventors and when they lived, making it easier to see who made what and when. Everything is laid out in a timeline, so you can follow the path from early tools to modern technology. The tech tree is not just for machines—it also includes ideas like democracy or the scientific method. This helps show that progress is not only about gadgets but also about ways of thinking. The site tries to show how inventions from different times and places connect. For example, it links Chinese inventions like paper and gunpowder with later uses in Europe. The chart is interactive, so you can zoom in and out or search for a specific invention. The goal is to help people see how technology builds up over many years and how one small idea can lead to big changes.

In the comment section, many people say they love the idea and find the site fun and useful. Some compare it to tech trees in video games, saying it makes history more interesting. A few users point out that making a tech tree for real history is hard because ideas do not always move in a straight line. Some inventions are forgotten and then rediscovered later, so the chart is not perfect. Others suggest adding more information about failures, dead ends, and the people behind lesser-known inventions. One commenter says it would be good to show social and political ideas more clearly, not just machines. Some worry that the chart might make it seem like progress is always moving forward, which is not always true. A few developers talk about how the website is built and suggest ways to make it faster or easier to use. Overall, most users enjoy exploring the tech tree and think it is a great tool for learning about history and invention.

Cursor CLI is a new tool that lets you use AI code help straight from your terminal. It is made by Cursor, the company behind the AI code editor, and is now in beta. You install it with a single command, and then you can ask it to review code, make changes, or help you write scripts, all without leaving the command line.

The tool uses the latest AI models, like OpenAI GPT-5, Claude, Gemini, and more. You can guide what the AI does in real time, set your own rules, or ask it to update documentation or check security. Cursor CLI works with many code editors, including VSCode, JetBrains, and IntelliJ, so you can add it to your favorite workflow. You can also write scripts to automate tasks, like running reviews or building custom agents.

Security is important because Cursor CLI can read, change, and delete files, and run shell commands you allow. They warn to use it only in safe environments, as it is still new and security is getting better. There are links to their security page and full documentation if you want to learn more.

In the comments, some people are excited about using AI in the terminal and think it could speed up coding. Others worry about security, since the tool can access all your files and run commands—one user says you should not use this on important machines yet. Some users like that it supports many AI models and works with popular editors, while others wish it was fully open source. A few people point out that installing tools with curl and bash is risky unless you trust the company. There is also talk about how AI tools are changing coding—some find it helpful, while others miss writing code by hand. One person suggests using it in a sandbox for safety. Many agree that the idea is interesting, but they want to see more real-world examples before using it daily.

## GPT-5: Key characteristics, pricing and system card

- 原文链接: [GPT-5: Key characteristics, pricing and system card](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/7/gpt-5/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44827794)

GPT-5 is OpenAI’s new language model, now used in ChatGPT and the API. The article reviews its features, pricing, and what’s new compared to past models.

GPT-5 works as a mix of different models: a fast one for easy questions, a deep one for hard problems, and a router that picks which to use based on your request. In the API, there are three versions—regular, mini, and nano—each can use more or less “reasoning” power (minimal, low, medium, high). The input token limit is 272,000 and output is 128,000, which is much bigger than before. GPT-5 understands text and images as input, but only gives text as output. It’s not a huge jump from earlier models, but it is more reliable and less likely to make mistakes. The new models are meant to replace most of the older OpenAI models, except for audio and image generation. 

Pricing is much lower than most competitors. For example, GPT-5 costs $1.25 per million input tokens and $10 per million output tokens. Mini and nano are even cheaper. If you reuse tokens soon after, you get a 90% discount. Compared to models like Claude and Gemini, GPT-5 is one of the cheapest, especially for mini and nano versions. 

The system card says GPT-5 was trained on a wide mix of data, with strong filtering to remove personal info. There are improvements in avoiding hallucinations, following instructions, and not just agreeing with everything (sycophancy). “Safe-completions” is a new way to avoid giving dangerous info; instead of saying “no” to a risky question, GPT-5 tries to answer safely without harmful details. The model is also better at admitting when it can’t do something, instead of pretending. 

Prompt injection (tricking the AI with clever prompts) is still an issue—56.8% of attacks worked, which is better than other models but still not safe enough. For developers, the API has new options to see the model’s “thinking traces,” and a setting to make it answer faster with less reasoning.

For fun, the author tested GPT-5’s ability to draw an SVG of a pelican on a bicycle—the results are the best yet, especially on the regular model.

In the comments, many users are impressed by the low pricing. Some worry this could hurt smaller AI companies and lead to less competition in the future. Several people note that the bigger context window (more tokens) is useful, but might make costs go up fast if you’re not careful. Developers are happy about the “reasoning traces” and better handling of reused tokens, as this could make chatbots faster and cheaper. Some are skeptical about the claim that hallucinations are almost gone, saying every model still makes mistakes in edge cases. There’s debate about “safe-completions”—a few think it’s better than refusals, but others fear it could hide important warnings or give unclear answers. Prompt injection worries remain, with one commenter saying that no model is truly safe yet, so you have to build other protections yourself. Others praise the honest admission when the model can’t answer, saying it’s a good step. Some hope OpenAI will soon add audio and image support to GPT-5. Finally, people enjoyed the SVG pelican test, with a few sharing their own fun prompts to try on new models.

## GPT-5 for Developers

- 原文链接: [GPT-5 for Developers](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44827101)

OpenAI has launched GPT-5 for developers, saying it’s their best model yet for writing code and handling complex tasks. The article explains that GPT-5 is better than older models in coding, bug fixing, following instructions, and working with big codebases.

GPT-5 scores higher on many tests, like SWE-bench Verified (74.9%) and Aider polyglot (88%), meaning it can solve more real-world software problems. It also handles long, tricky jobs well, like planning, updating, and finishing tasks without needing lots of help. The model is good at both backend and frontend coding, and companies like Cursor, Windsurf, and Vercel say it’s smarter, easier to use, and more reliable than before. GPT-5 can work with new API settings like `verbosity` (to make answers longer or shorter) and `reasoning_effort` (to trade speed for thinking quality). There’s a new tool system, too, letting GPT-5 use plain text instead of only JSON, which helps with tricky outputs.

Developers can pick from three model sizes—gpt-5, mini, and nano—to balance speed, price, and power. GPT-5 also works better with tools, handles mistakes well, and can remember much more context (up to 400,000 tokens). It makes fewer factual mistakes and is more honest about what it can do. The pricing is tiered: full GPT-5 costs $1.25 per million input tokens and $10 per million output tokens, with cheaper options for mini and nano. GPT-5 is also available in Microsoft’s services like Copilot and Azure.

Many Hacker News readers are impressed by GPT-5’s technical improvements, especially for coding and working with big, complex projects. Some developers like the new API features that give them more control, such as setting how much the model thinks or how long its answers are. Others are excited about the better tool-calling and the option to use plain text for tool inputs.

However, some commenters are cautious. They worry about the high price for the full model, which could be tough for smaller companies or hobbyists. A few people ask about real-world performance, not just test scores, and want to see how GPT-5 works in live products. Some debate if the model is truly more “intelligent” or just better at following instructions. There’s also talk about OpenAI’s focus on safety and trust—some are glad about fewer mistakes, while others want more info on how safe the model really is. A few wonder how long it will be before an even newer model comes out, and what this fast pace means for developers building on top of these tools. Overall, the reaction is a mix of excitement, hope, and a bit of caution.

## OpenAI's new open-source model is basically Phi-5

- 原文链接: [OpenAI's new open-source model is basically Phi-5](https://www.seangoedecke.com/gpt-oss-is-phi-5/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44828884)

OpenAI just released its first open-source large language models, called gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b. These models do well on some tests but not on others, especially real-world tasks like simple question answering. The article says these models have good general knowledge in science, but they do not know much about popular culture. The author thinks these models might seem strong in benchmarks but will not help much in real life.

The article compares these new OpenAI models to Microsoft’s Phi models, which are trained using only synthetic data. Synthetic data is made by computers, not taken from books or the internet. This lets you control the data, but it costs more to make. Phi models also did well on tests but were disappointing in practice. The reason is that if you make your own training data, you can make it close to the test questions, so the model “trains for the test” instead of learning in a broad way.

Sebastien Bubeck, who worked on the Phi models, now works at OpenAI. The author thinks it is likely he helped with the new gpt-oss models and that these models also used a lot of synthetic or filtered data. One big reason for using synthetic data is safety. Open-source models can be changed by anyone, and companies worry about their models being used for things they do not want. If you train a model only on safe, clean data, it is less likely to give bad or risky answers.

The author thinks OpenAI wanted to beat other open-source models from China in tests, but also wanted to avoid scandals from bad model behavior. OpenAI’s main business is still closed-source models, so their open-source model does not need to be the best—just safe and good at benchmarks. The article says these new models are basically Phi-5 in all but name.

People in the Hacker News comments have mixed views. Some are happy to see any open-source release from OpenAI, even if it is not perfect. Others feel disappointed that the models are not really “open-source”—the weights are free, but the data and code are not. Many agree that synthetic data helps make safer models, but they worry this also makes the models less useful in real situations. Some users say benchmarks do not show real ability, and they want to see how the models do with tasks like coding or writing. A few people mention that safety is important, but too much control can make models boring and less creative. There are also comments about how open-source AI is changing fast, and some think OpenAI is just trying to keep up with competition. Others wonder if this move is more about public image than real openness. Some ask for more technical details about training, but notice that OpenAI is keeping those private. Many are waiting to see real-world tests and hope the community will find new uses or problems with these models.

## Benchmark Framework Desktop Mainboard and 4-node cluster

- 原文链接: [Benchmark Framework Desktop Mainboard and 4-node cluster](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ollama-benchmark/issues/21)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44827862)

This article is about testing the Framework Desktop Mainboard, both as a single machine and as a 4-node cluster, to see how well it can run large AI models. The author used AMD Ryzen CPUs with Radeon iGPUs, and tried different setups, network speeds, and Linux software to run benchmarks.

First, the author tested a single node with 128 GB RAM, and then made a cluster with four nodes, totaling 512 GB RAM. Benchmarks were run using models like Llama and DeepSeek, showing how many tokens per second each setup could process. The first tests used only the CPU, and got 45 tokens/s for a 3B model, dropping to about 2 tokens/s for much larger models. DeepSeek models were also tested and had similar drops in speed as model size grew.

Next, the author tried to use the GPU for speedups. Getting ROCm (AMD’s GPU driver) to work was hard on Fedora 42 but worked on Fedora Rawhide. Using llama.cpp with Vulkan and ROCm, the speed increased a lot: small models ran at over 1,000 tokens/s on the GPU, and even the 70B model could do about 34 tokens/s.

The author also tried running models across all four nodes using llama.cpp’s RPC feature and the distributed-llama project. Some very large models (like 405B or 671B) were hard to run, often causing out-of-memory errors, even on the cluster. Some tweaks, like using smaller quantized versions of models, helped a bit, but speed was still low for the biggest models (less than 1 token/s in some cases). They also tried OpenAI’s new GPT-OSS models, which ran well on the GPU, and noted that different backends (Vulkan vs ROCm) gave different results.

In the comments, one user suggested using smaller model quantizations (like Q4_K_XL or Q3_K_XL) for better fit and speed, and said ROCm balances memory better than Vulkan. Another user noted that MXFP4 versions of the GPT-OSS models should be faster. Someone was surprised that Ollama didn’t detect the iGPU, since support was added months ago, and the author replied that ROCm now works, but Vulkan still isn’t supported in Ollama, which is frustrating. Others shared that they use llama.cpp directly or LM Studio because of better hardware support.

There was talk about possibly using vLLM for CPU or ROCm-based inference, but it’s unclear if multi-node GPU support works yet. One commenter, who helped with the Vulkan backend, was happy to see it used but wished Framework hardware was cheaper. Another reader said these benchmarks help them decide if the Framework Desktop is fast enough to buy. There was also a discussion about model file names and formats, and requests for tests with more models. Overall, people liked the detailed benchmarks and shared tips to help others run big AI models on their own clusters.

## Building Bluesky comments for my blog

- 原文链接: [Building Bluesky comments for my blog](https://natalie.sh/posts/bluesky-comments/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44826164)

This article talks about adding Bluesky-powered comments to a personal blog, instead of using tools like Disqus or self-hosted systems. The author explains they disliked Disqus for being slow and tracking users, and found self-hosted comment systems too much work with spam, maintenance, and user management.

Instead, the author uses Bluesky, a decentralized social network, as the comment platform. Bluesky’s API made it easy to fetch conversation threads. The process works by sharing each blog post on Bluesky, then linking the Bluesky post to the blog. Replies to the Bluesky post appear as comments under the blog post. This solution means no backend to manage, better performance, real user profiles, and richer content (like images and links) in comments. The author capped comment nesting at five levels for readability and used TypeScript for safer coding.

The blog uses Astro with React, making it easy to add this system with a small code snippet. The author likes that comments are an “enhancement”—the blog works fine without them if JavaScript is off or the API fails. Bluesky’s CDN serves images fast, and the API is public and easy to use. The author believes this approach is better because it connects independent blogs to bigger social conversations, without locking anyone to one platform.

Many commenters on Hacker News and Bluesky liked the idea, calling it “neat” and “cool.” Some said they might use the idea for their own blogs. One person pointed out that moderation and spam could be a problem. Others suggested that using Bluesky means comments are only open to Bluesky users, which could limit the audience, similar to using GitHub Issues. There was discussion about handling long comment threads, and the author explained the choice to limit nesting depth. Some people mentioned UI improvements and asked why the system needed client-side JavaScript and not server-side rendering; the author replied that server-side would cost more for hosting. A few readers shared their own past attempts with similar systems on Twitter, but moved away when Twitter changed. Others asked about possible automation, like posting to Bluesky directly from the blog build process. Most feedback was positive, and several people thanked the author for sharing the code and ideas.

## Encryption made for police and military radios may be easily cracked

- 原文链接: [Encryption made for police and military radios may be easily cracked](https://www.wired.com/story/encryption-made-for-police-and-military-radios-may-be-easily-cracked-researchers-find/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44828504)

This article is about a security problem with the encryption used in radios for police, military, and critical infrastructure around the world. Researchers from the Netherlands found that both the original TETRA encryption and a newer end-to-end encryption (E2EE) used on these radios can be weak and easy to break.

The TETRA system has been used since the 1990s in many countries outside the US for police, military, and infrastructure communications. The standard includes four main encryption algorithms, but in 2023, researchers showed that one (TEA1) cuts its security key from 80 to just 32 bits, making it possible to crack in less than a minute. After this was found, the standards group ETSI suggested that users add an extra layer of end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for more security.

However, the same researchers have now found that one E2EE solution, which was endorsed by ETSI and widely used, also has a flaw. The E2EE starts with a strong 128-bit key but shrinks it to 56 bits, making it much easier to break. This means that even with E2EE, attackers could listen to private communications or even send fake or replayed messages to confuse users. The E2EE flaw is from the protocol design, not just a single device, and may affect radios from many vendors, not just Sepura.

The problem is made worse because these radios are used by police and military in many countries, including those in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Users may not even know if their radios use the weaker keys, as documentation is often secret or unclear. Sometimes, export rules control how strong the encryption can be, and the actual key length is set by factory settings, not always fully explained to buyers.

The standards group ETSI says that governments can choose their encryption and key lengths, and that they expect national security agencies to know what they’re getting. But researchers doubt this, arguing that some governments might not realize they are getting weak encryption or might not be told by vendors.

In the comment section, some people are shocked that such important systems use weak or secret encryption. Others point out that export control laws often force companies to weaken encryption for certain countries. Some users say that using closed, secret algorithms instead of open ones is always risky, and this story proves it. A few comment that government buyers should be more careful and demand full details about security features. Some agree with the researchers, saying it’s unlikely that government users know exactly what level of security they have. Other readers warn that, because radios are used in critical areas like police work and infrastructure, these flaws could have serious real-world impacts. A few suggest that open standards and public code review would have found these problems sooner. Some also think that vendors may be hiding this on purpose, while others blame slow government processes. Lastly, a few say that with today’s computing power, using short keys (like 32 or 56 bits) is simply not safe and should be banned for sensitive uses.

## Windows XP Professional

- 原文链接: [Windows XP Professional](https://win32.run/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44824539)

This post is about Windows XP Professional and how people can boot or install it using different options. The article shows a menu with choices you see when starting a computer—like booting Windows, installing it, or using network boot.

The menu lets you pick what you want to do with the computer. You can start Windows XP normally if it’s already installed. Or, you can choose to install Windows XP, which means you set up the operating system on your computer. There are also options to boot from the network, which is useful in offices or schools where computers get Windows from a server instead of a CD or USB.

The menu also gives you tools to change how your computer works. You can go into the BIOS setup, which is a special area where you change hardware settings. Device configuration lets you pick which parts, like hard drives or USB ports, are used. BIOS flash update is for updating the computer’s low-level software, which can fix bugs or add new features. You can also change how the computer picks what to boot from first.

This menu is important for people who fix computers, install software, or set up many computers at once. It also reminds people of older ways to set up systems, which some still use today.

In the comments, some people are excited and feel nostalgic about Windows XP. They say it was simple and easy to use, and they remember using it when they were younger. Others mention that Windows XP is old and not safe to use today, because it does not get security updates. A few users talk about using XP for old games or special programs that don’t work on new Windows versions.

Some commenters explain that boot menus like this are still useful for fixing computers or testing new setups. Others share worries about running old operating systems on the internet, because of viruses and hackers. There are also people who like learning how computers work by using these old tools. Finally, some users say modern systems are more complex, but not always better for everyone.
