This post talks about a small web game called “Messenger.” In the game, you deliver messages on a tiny, round planet using your web browser with WebGL technology. The planet is small, and you can walk all the way around it, seeing the landscape curve under your feet. You play as a little character who runs from house to house, delivering letters and packages to different people. The game is simple to play and does not need any downloads—just open the website and start. The graphics are cute and colorful, with smooth animations and a calm feeling. There is no fighting or danger, just relaxing tasks. Some players liked that you can see the whole planet as you move, which feels different from normal flat games. There are small details, like clouds, trees, and people waiting for their mail. The controls are easy: you use your keyboard to move and deliver mail. The game saves your progress, so you can stop and come back later. The creator made it as a hobby project, sharing updates and asking for feedback from players.

In the comments, many people praised the game’s peaceful style and simple design. Some said it reminded them of old, fun Flash games. A few users enjoyed the relaxing feeling and said it was a nice break from stressful games. Others talked about the technical side, saying WebGL works well here and it loads fast on most computers. A few people gave tips to make the controls even easier. Some suggested adding more story or puzzles to keep players interested longer. One user worried that the game might not work on very old devices, while others said it ran fine for them. Some liked how you can see the planet curve, calling it a clever use of graphics. A few asked if the creator would add more planets or characters in the future. There was also talk about how simple web games are making a comeback, and this game shows how fun they can be. Overall, the comments were positive, with many saying they enjoyed their time playing Messenger.

## The death of east London's most radical bookshop

- 原文链接: [The death of east London's most radical bookshop](https://www.the-londoner.co.uk/scarlett-letters-closure-left-wing-bookshop/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45398153)

This article tells the story of the closing of Scarlett Letters, a radical left-wing bookshop in east London. The shop, opened with big hopes of being a community hub, ended up closing after a messy fight between the owner and staff.

It started with a small problem—a clogged toilet and a new rule about using it. The shop’s owner, Marin Scarlett, said staff had to escort anyone wanting to use the toilet, and she wanted them to practice saying “no” to customers. Staff found this rule odd and even sexist, which made them angry. This led to bigger issues that had been building up: lack of sick pay, no secure contracts, and low pay. Soon, all the staff joined a union and made demands like better pay, safer contracts, and a say in how the shop was run.

Scarlett agreed to some things but said she was also struggling—working long hours for less money than the staff. She worried about money too, saying that an anonymous investor might stop giving funds if the shop became a co-op. The staff went public on social media, saying their identities were used for marketing, but their voices were ignored. Scarlett replied online, saying she tried to meet their demands, but the fight caused sales to drop. Eventually, she announced the shop would close.

The staff then occupied the shop, hoping to get the stock and start their own co-op. Scarlett acted quickly, arriving with a locksmith and helpers at 4am to take back the books and furniture. After that, the bookshop stood empty, with signs for a possible new co-op run by the old staff.

In the Hacker News comments, some people felt sad about the story and said it showed how hard it is to mix radical ideas with running a real business. Others thought the staff were too idealistic and did not understand business realities, like needing investors and profit to survive. A few said the owner also made mistakes, such as not being open or flexible enough. There was debate about unions: some said even “radical” places need them, while others felt unions can sometimes make things harder for small businesses. Several readers talked about the difficult balance between community values and money, and how even good intentions can end in conflict. Some commenters worried that stories like this hurt trust between workers and small business owners. But others hoped the new co-op would learn from the problems and do better in the future.

## The Postmark backdoor that’s downloading emails

- 原文链接: [The Postmark backdoor that’s downloading emails](https://www.koi.security/blog/postmark-mcp-npm-malicious-backdoor-email-theft)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45395957)

This article talks about a dangerous backdoor hidden in a popular npm package called “postmark-mcp,” which many developers use to help their AI assistants send emails. The problem started when the package, trusted by hundreds of teams, suddenly began secretly copying every email—including sensitive ones like password resets and invoices—to an outside server owned by the developer.

For over 15 versions, “postmark-mcp” worked perfectly and was recommended by many. But in version 1.0.16, the developer added just one line of code that sent a hidden copy (BCC) of every email to “giftshop.club.” This was simple but very effective. The developer didn’t use any advanced hacking tricks. Instead, users gave the package full access to their email systems, never guessing it could be dangerous.

The package looked safe because it was published by a real person with a good reputation on GitHub. Many developers trusted it and used it in daily workflows. But once the backdoor was added, thousands of emails per day started going to the attacker’s server. Even after the package was removed from npm, it stayed on users’ machines, continuing to send stolen emails.

The article explains that this is not just about one bad package. It shows a bigger problem: developers often trust tools from strangers and give them full control over emails, databases, and other important systems. There is no security check, no sandbox, and no warning if something goes wrong. AI assistants use these tools automatically, so if a package goes bad, no one may notice for a long time.

The article also describes how Koi’s risk engine found the problem by noticing the new behavior in version 1.0.16. They recommend that anyone using the package should uninstall it right away, rotate any passwords or secrets sent by email, and check logs for anything sent to “giftshop.club.”

In the Hacker News comments, some users are shocked that such a simple trick worked on so many teams. They point out how risky it is to trust any open-source package, especially ones that handle important data. Others say this shows a big weakness in how companies manage software supply chains, with too much trust and too little checking.

A few commenters defend open source, saying most developers are honest, but agree that better security tools and review processes are needed. Some share tips for checking code before using new packages, like reviewing code changes and using security scanners. Others mention that deleting a package from npm doesn’t fix the problem, since many systems keep using the old, now-dangerous version.

People also talk about how AI assistants using these tools make the issue even worse, because they act without human review. Some ask if there should be stricter rules for packages that handle sensitive data, or better ways to verify who writes and maintains them. A few suggest that companies need new tools to watch for risky changes in packages, not just trust that nothing will go wrong.

Overall, the community agrees this backdoor is a big warning. They say every developer and company should be more careful about what code they run and who they trust, especially when it comes to tools with so much power.

## Role of Amazon fires in the record atmospheric CO₂ growth in 2024

- 原文链接: [Role of Amazon fires in the record atmospheric CO₂ growth in 2024](https://essopenarchive.org/doi/full/10.22541/essoar.175874118.83695562/v1)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45396284)

A new study looks at why the amount of CO₂ in the air is rising so fast in 2024. The article says that fires in the Amazon rainforest are a big reason for this record growth. Usually, forests like the Amazon take in CO₂ and help keep the air clean. But when the forest burns, it releases a lot of CO₂ instead.

The study explains that this year, the Amazon had more fires than usual. These fires sent a huge amount of CO₂ into the air. The researchers think this is making climate change worse. They also say that dry weather and higher temperatures made the fires worse. Cutting down trees (deforestation) is another problem, as it means there are fewer trees to absorb CO₂.

Scientists use satellites and ground sensors to measure CO₂ levels. They notice that the rise in CO₂ this year is higher than in many past years. The article warns that if the Amazon keeps burning, it might change from being a “carbon sink” (something that removes CO₂) to a “carbon source” (something that adds CO₂). This would be very bad for the climate.

Some top comments on Hacker News worry that we are not doing enough to stop these fires. Others say that local farmers burn land to clear it for crops, and this is hard to stop. A few people think that rich countries should help more, as the Amazon is important for the whole world. Some users point out that climate change itself makes fires worse, creating a dangerous cycle. Others ask if technology can help track and stop illegal fires faster. There are also comments about how protecting forests is cheaper than fixing the damage later. Some users feel sad and frustrated that this problem keeps getting worse. Others hope that more news about the Amazon will lead to stronger action. A few users question if the data is fully accurate, but most agree the trend is worrying. Some say everyone should care, not just people in Brazil. Many comments stress that saving the Amazon is urgent for the planet’s future.

## LLM Observability in the Wild – Why OpenTelemetry Should Be the Standard

- 原文链接: [LLM Observability in the Wild – Why OpenTelemetry Should Be the Standard](https://signoz.io/blog/llm-observability-opentelemetry/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45398467)

This article talks about the problems teams face when trying to watch and debug AI agents (like chatbots) in real products. The main focus is on how different tools and standards make it hard to see exactly what AI is doing, especially when using large language models (LLMs).

The team at Chatwoot built an AI agent that can reply to customers across many platforms, like email and WhatsApp. But in real use, the AI sometimes replied in the wrong language or gave strange answers, and the team could not easily see why. They needed better “observability”—ways to track what the AI was doing, what data it used, and how it made decisions.

They tried several tools. OpenAI’s own tracing tool was detailed, but only worked with OpenAI’s system and was hard to filter. New Relic was already in use, but its interface was slow and deep. Phoenix, which uses the OpenInference standard, showed more useful AI details but did not work well with Ruby, the language their site uses. Also, Phoenix and OpenTelemetry (the main industry standard for tracking software) do not always understand each other’s data.

The main problem is that OpenTelemetry is used everywhere and works with many languages, but was not built for AI. It only has basic types for tracking work, like “server” or “client.” OpenInference was made for AI and can show things like LLM calls or tool use, but it’s new, not widely used, and supports fewer languages.

This means teams have tough choices: use OpenTelemetry and miss out on AI details, try to build their own tools, or change the language they use. None of these are easy.

The article recommends sticking with one main standard (like OpenTelemetry), even if some AI details are lost, to keep everything simple. It suggests following the OpenTelemetry GenAI working group as they work to add better support for AI. It also says teams should share their needs, so standards can get better.

Commenters had many thoughts. Some agreed that having too many standards makes things confusing and said OpenTelemetry’s wide support makes it the best choice for now. Others pointed out that AI tools change fast, so any standard may fall behind. Some users working with Ruby were frustrated by the lack of support and wished OpenInference would support more languages. A few people liked Phoenix’s rich data but worried about lock-in. Some wanted OpenTelemetry to add more AI features quickly, while others said it is better to have one simple, shared standard than many small, special ones. Several said that, for now, it is more practical to use OpenTelemetry everywhere and just add custom tags or fields for AI, rather than switching tools. Others asked for more real-world examples and guides, saying the space is still too new and messy.

## Typst: A Possible LaTeX Replacement

- 原文链接: [Typst: A Possible LaTeX Replacement](https://lwn.net/Articles/1037577/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45393842)

Typst is a new tool for typesetting documents, aiming to replace LaTeX for technical writing, especially with math and tables. The article explains that Typst gives similar high-quality results as LaTeX, but is much easier to use, faster to compile, and simpler to customize.

LaTeX has been the standard for technical documents for decades, but it is hard to install, slow, and its error messages are confusing. Customizing LaTeX often needs deep, complex knowledge. Many people hoped for a replacement, but nothing seemed good enough—until now. Typst started as a fun project in 2019 and quickly grew, with hundreds of contributors. It is free, written in Rust, and easy to install.

Typst uses a single command-line tool, unlike LaTeX, which has many confusing versions. Its markup is short and readable, borrowing from Markdown, and math is easy to write using Unicode. Typst gives clear, colorful error messages, showing exactly where mistakes are. Live previews are fast and responsive, even for big documents.

Typst has three modes: text, code, and math. You can switch between them easily. Customizing documents—like changing fonts or headings—is simple, using built-in functions. Its programming style is modern, similar to Rust, and avoids the messy macro problems of LaTeX. Typst also handles things like floating figures and splitting tables across pages better than LaTeX.

However, Typst is still young. It lacks some advanced layout features, has fewer packages, and its documentation is not always clear or up-to-date. Most journals do not yet accept Typst documents, so users often need to convert their work to LaTeX. Typst cannot do everything LaTeX does, but its package ecosystem is growing quickly. There are also some small issues, like no italics correction, but these may get fixed over time.

In the comments, some users praise Typst for its simple syntax, quick previews, and helpful community. Others worry about backward compatibility—will old Typst documents still work years from now? Some say LaTeX is not as stable as people think, because packages often change or break. Others report that their old LaTeX files still work fine, especially if they avoided new or unstable packages.

Many agree that LaTeX is powerful but hard to learn, and that its macro system is confusing. Some point out that LaTeX's stability has also stopped it from changing with the times, like adding Unicode or better font support. There are worries that new tools like Typst might "reinvent the wheel" and forget lessons learned from older systems.

A few users compare Typst to other typesetting projects, like SILE and Lout. Some like that Typst is Turing-complete, meaning it is very flexible, while others think this could hurt future compatibility. People notice Typst's package system is growing fast, and its development is very active. Some users say that Typst already handles most common document needs, but a few advanced features (like music notation) are still missing.

Overall, excitement about Typst is strong, but many people will keep using LaTeX until Typst proves itself over time and more journals support it.

## I made a public living room and the internet keeps putting weirder stuff in it

- 原文链接: [I made a public living room and the internet keeps putting weirder stuff in it](https://www.theroom.lol)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45398005)

Someone built a website called THE ROOM where anyone on the internet can upload an image and edit it together with strangers in real time. The idea is to have a shared, public “living room” space where people can change the main picture, and the next person will see those changes and can add their own.

The site lets you upload a starting image, and then the room’s visitors can draw, write, or add things on top. There are limits on how many changes you can make, and it resets after a set number of edits. You have to agree to the rules before joining, and sometimes you need to prove you’re human with a quick check. Many people are in the room at once, and everyone’s edits are visible to each other. Sometimes the site runs out of “cloud credits,” so it asks users to help keep it running by sharing a post or donating. The creators plan to let people make custom rooms soon, but for now, everyone shares the same main space.

In the Hacker News comments, some people loved the playful idea and thought it was fun to see the chaos and creativity. Others compared it to older internet projects like Reddit’s r/place, where big groups worked together or made “wars” over the images. Some users joked about the weird things people uploaded—like memes or random doodles—and said it shows how unpredictable group art can be. A few worried that without strong rules, someone might upload bad or offensive images, but most agreed the site’s reset and moderation tools help limit this. Others talked about the technical side, like how hard it must be to keep everything live and smooth with so many users. Some wondered if the project could last, since paying for servers and cloud credits can get expensive, especially if it gets popular. But many commenters said they were happy to see something silly and creative on the internet, and hoped more people would try it out.

## Norway to Monitor Airborne Radioactivity in Svalbard

- 原文链接: [Norway to Monitor Airborne Radioactivity in Svalbard](https://www.highnorthnews.com/en/norway-monitor-airborne-radioactivity-svalbard)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45396641)

Norway is starting to watch for radioactive particles in the air at Svalbard, a group of islands in the far north. This is because the Finnish team that used to do this job is stopping, so Norway’s Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority will take over on October 1st.

The main tool is an air filter station near Ny-Ålesund, which has been running since 2000. The goal is to make sure Norway is ready if there is a nuclear accident or some other event that puts radioactivity into the air. The new station will add to other stations Norway already has. Markus Ottosen, who leads the project, says it is especially important in the northern parts of Norway, where Svalbard is. The station can help find out if dangerous radioactive particles are moving through the air, and how much there is, if something happens. Norway will also keep using data from another air station near Longyearbyen, which is managed by a different research group.

The article points out that keeping watch is extra important now because there are worries about nuclear safety in the Arctic. For example, there are reports about possible nuclear tests in Russia, and some cooperation between Norway and Russia on nuclear safety has stopped.

In the comment section, many people say this is a good idea. Some say it is wise to have more ways to check for radioactivity, especially with current world tensions. Others note that the Arctic is close to Russia, which has nuclear sites, and so being ready is smart. A few people ask why the Finnish group is leaving and if it means less teamwork in the region. Some say technology for measuring radioactivity is not hard, but getting and sharing good data is important. There are also comments about how Norway is being careful and responsible by taking over rather than letting the station close. A few users worry about the risk of accidents or secret tests and think more countries should share data. Others say it is good that the public will know if there is a problem. Some wonder if this move is also about politics, not just safety, but most agree that more monitoring is a good step for everyone.
