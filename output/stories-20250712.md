## Bypassing Google's big anti-adblock update

- 原文链接: [Bypassing Google's big anti-adblock update](https://0x44.xyz/blog/web-request-blocking/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44544266)

Google updated Chrome to stop adblockers by moving from MV2 to MV3, making it hard for extensions to block ads. The article explains how the author found a bug that let adblockers work anyway, even with MV3.

Chrome extensions used to block ads using a feature called `webRequestBlocking`. MV3 removed this, hurting adblockers. The author noticed that Chrome still had some old JavaScript code that handled extension events, including the important `chrome.webRequest` API. This old code could be tricked. By creating a fake event using a special constructor and adding a special number (a WebView ID), the extension could skip the new checks and block web requests just like before. This bug worked because Chrome did not check if the extension was allowed to use this trick. The feature was meant for old platform apps, which Chrome had stopped supporting years ago, but the code was still there. The author reported the bug to Google, and they fixed it in Chrome 118 by making sure only real platform apps could use the WebView trick. The bug was not seen as a security problem, so the author received no reward, but found it funny that a few lines of code could break such a big change.

Hacker News users had many thoughts. Some people were impressed by the creativity involved in finding the bug. Others said this shows how old, forgotten code can create problems in big software projects. A few commenters felt Google’s move to MV3 was mainly to weaken adblockers and help their ad business. Some users argued that Chrome’s extension system is getting too complex and risky, while others were glad that Google fixed the bug quickly after it was reported. There was debate about whether Google should reward finds like this, even if they aren’t direct security issues. A few developers shared similar stories where leftover or old code led to surprising bugs. Some people were frustrated that important features for users, like adblocking, are being removed or weakened. Others pointed out that this kind of bug might not exist if Chrome’s extension system was simpler or written with better security in mind. A few were curious if other browsers had the same problem, and some joked about how even big companies can make silly mistakes that last for years.

## Supreme Court's ruling practically wipes out free speech for sex writing online

- 原文链接: [Supreme Court's ruling practically wipes out free speech for sex writing online](https://ellsberg.substack.com/p/free-speech)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44543865)

The article explains how a new Supreme Court ruling lets states enforce strict age-verification laws for any online writing that includes sex scenes or nudity, even if it’s just text meant for adults. Now, writers can be sued or even face criminal charges from other states if minors access their work online and it’s not protected behind an ID check.

The author, who writes raunchy comedy and sex-themed stories on his personal website, says enforcing these laws is almost impossible for indie writers. The Tennessee law requires anyone posting more than 33% “harmful to minors” content to use complex age checks, like matching a photo ID with a selfie, and rechecking every hour. South Dakota’s law is even stricter—it applies even for a single “harmful” paragraph or image, with jail time for repeat offenses.

To follow these laws, creators would have to store personal ID data for years, build or pay for expensive tech, and force every reader to upload their ID every time they visit. Few indie artists can afford this, and most readers won’t bother. The risk of huge lawsuits or jail time is now so high that many writers may just give up on sharing any sexual content online.

The article notes that these laws are not just about porn—they cover written descriptions, art, and even sex education, and they’re being used to ban books and restrict public libraries. The laws don’t stop kids from seeing hardcore porn on foreign sites, which ignore US laws anyway. Instead, they just make it much harder for American creators to share anything adult, even with grown-up readers.

The author argues that parents should use content filters and talk to their kids, not rely on sweeping bans. He points out that American culture accepts lots of violent content for minors but is far stricter about sex, which he thinks is inconsistent.

In the Hacker News comments, some people agree that these laws are a big threat to free speech and will mostly hurt small creators, not big porn companies. Others point out that age-verification tech is expensive, easy to bypass, and a privacy risk. A few worry that the laws could be used to ban LGBT+ content or sex education, not just porn.

Some commenters say parents have a duty to control what their kids see, rather than expecting the internet to be “safe” for everyone. Others think the Supreme Court’s ruling will face more legal challenges, as it conflicts with the First Amendment and might be overturned later.

A few support age gates for truly explicit content, but think these laws go way too far. Some people say the real problem is the patchwork of state laws—making it impossible for anyone online to know what’s legal. Others share worries about chilling effects, with indie writers and artists leaving the web or self-censoring.

Some commenters note the irony that violence is allowed for minors, but sex isn’t, and agree with the author’s call for more balanced standards. Finally, a few suggest that the laws are political grandstanding and won’t actually protect kids, since most porn is served from overseas and won’t follow US rules.

## Kimi k2 largest open source SOTA model?

- 原文链接: [Kimi k2 largest open source SOTA model?](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Kimi-K2)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44543508)

Kimi K2 is a new open-source large language model made by Moonshot AI, with 1 trillion parameters and a special mixture-of-experts (MoE) design. The model is trained to be very good at reasoning, coding, and using tools, and it has two main versions: Kimi-K2-Base for research and fine-tuning, and Kimi-K2-Instruct for easy chat and agent-like use.

Kimi K2 uses 32 billion activated parameters per use and was trained on 15.5 trillion tokens, making it one of the largest open models. It uses a new optimizer called Muon, which helps make training stable even at a huge scale. The model supports up to 128,000 tokens in its context, making it good for long conversations or documents. Kimi K2 is designed for tasks that need smart reasoning, like solving math problems, writing code, or calling tools.

On many benchmarks, Kimi K2-Instruct beats other open models and even some closed ones like GPT-4 in coding, math, and general knowledge tasks. For example, it scored 65.8% on the SWE-bench coding test and did very well in math contests. The model can also call tools (like checking the weather) directly from chat, and it’s easy to deploy using popular inference engines like vLLM and TensorRT-LLM. The code and weights are released under a modified MIT license.

Top Hacker News comments have mixed views. Some users are excited to see a trillion-parameter open-source model and praise the strong benchmark results, especially in coding. Others are cautious, pointing out that only 32 billion parameters are active at one time, so real compute costs may be lower than the trillion number suggests. A few comments question if the MoE approach gives real advantages over dense models, especially for everyday users.

Many developers are happy that Kimi K2 supports tool-calling and has APIs compatible with OpenAI and Anthropic, making integration easier. Some users warn that running Kimi K2 locally still needs a lot of GPU power and memory—so it’s not for everyone. Others wonder about the quality of the training data and ask for more details, especially since the paper is not out yet.

A few people express concern about the “modified MIT” license, asking what restrictions it adds. There’s also talk about the lack of English documentation or community support, since most resources seem focused on the Chinese market. Some are excited to try the model for their own projects, while others wait for more real-world tests before making a judgment. Overall, the release is seen as a big step for open AI, but users want to see more transparency and real usage examples.

## Exposing a web service with Cloudflare Tunnel (2022)

- 原文链接: [Exposing a web service with Cloudflare Tunnel (2022)](https://erisa.dev/exposing-a-web-service-with-cloudflare-tunnel/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44507799)

This article explains how to make a web service on your home machine public using Cloudflare Tunnel. It is for people who want to host a website or app but do not want to set up complex networking or open ports on their router.

Cloudflare Tunnel lets your server connect out to Cloudflare, so no one connects directly to your home IP. This keeps your server safer and saves you from firewall and port-forwarding problems. You still need a Cloudflare account with a domain name, but after that, setup is simple.

First, you install the Cloudflare Tunnel client, called cloudflared, on your Linux machine. You log in with your Cloudflare account, then create a tunnel. This tunnel has its own ID and a special credentials file. Next, you make a config file where you tell cloudflared which tunnel to use and what web service to share—like a local Nginx web server or a directory with Python’s http.server.

The config file can be simple (one service) or advanced (multiple hostnames and services). You then set up cloudflared as a systemd service so it runs in the background and starts at boot. To finish, you add a DNS record for your chosen subdomain, pointing it to the tunnel. You can do this with a command or through the Cloudflare dashboard. After a few seconds, your local website is live on the public internet, protected by Cloudflare.

The article gives full step-by-step commands and tips. It suggests checking the logs if something does not work and points to the official docs for more details.

In the comments, some people say Cloudflare Tunnel is great for making self-hosted projects public without security worries. They like that it works even behind home routers and can handle dynamic IP addresses. Others warn that while this is easy and safe, you still need to keep your web server updated and secure—Cloudflare helps, but it does not fix insecure apps.

Some users mention that Cloudflare Tunnel is nice for small or personal projects, but for big or business use, you should check the rules and limits. A few people like that you can use the same tunnel for different services and subdomains. Others ask about privacy and if Cloudflare can see your traffic—some say yes, since all data goes through their servers, but it is encrypted.

There are questions about performance, and most users say it is fast enough for normal use. Some share stories about using this for remote access to smart home devices or small company apps. A few people remind others to read Cloudflare’s terms, as hosting some things at home may be against their rules. Finally, many agree this is a good tool for indie hackers and hobbyists who want to share projects online without lots of setup.

## The fish kick may be the fastest subsurface swim stroke yet (2015)

- 原文链接: [The fish kick may be the fastest subsurface swim stroke yet (2015)](https://nautil.us/is-this-new-swim-stroke-the-fastest-yet-235511/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44541576)

The article talks about a new swimming move called the “fish kick,” which might be the fastest way for humans to swim underwater. The writer tries it at their local pool, but it’s hard to do well, so they ask Misty Hyman, an Olympic gold medalist, for help.

Most fish move by wiggling their bodies side to side, and the fish kick copies this idea. You swim on your side, arms above your head, and undulate your whole body in a smooth, wave-like motion. This is different from the more common “dolphin kick,” where swimmers kick up and down while face-down. Experts have learned that swimming under the water is faster than swimming at the surface because you don’t have to fight against waves.

The article explains why swimming at the surface is slow. When you swim on top, you make a bow wave, like a boat, and you can’t go faster than that wave. Underwater, you avoid this problem. Coaches first noticed in the 1980s that underwater kicks were fast, and swimmers began staying under longer. That’s why swimming rules now say you must come up after 15 meters.

Misty Hyman’s coach wanted to see if turning the body sideways, like a fish, could be even faster than the dolphin kick. They tested this using food dye to watch the water movement. They saw big whirlpools, or vortices, which seemed to push her forward better when she kicked sideways than when she kicked up and down.

Some scientists think the fish kick is faster because the sideways kicks create helpful vortices that don’t get messed up by the pool floor or surface. Others say it’s harder to control your direction with the fish kick, and it takes a lot of skill. The article says that, if perfected, the fish kick might be unbeatable, but it’s tough to learn.

In the Hacker News comments, many people found the science behind the fish kick fascinating and liked learning about how small changes in technique can make a big difference in swimming. Some commenters shared their own experiences with swimming underwater and trying dolphin kicks or fish-like moves for fun. Others talked about how swimming rules had to change because swimmers were staying under too long, and how this stroke might not be practical for races where all swimmers are underwater, since it’s less exciting to watch.

A few people asked if the fish kick is allowed in competitions or if it’s mostly used during the underwater part after starts and turns. Another commenter wondered if the fish kick could help regular swimmers or if it’s just for top athletes. Some said it’s cool that swimming still has room for new ideas, unlike running. Others pointed out that learning the fish kick is hard and controlling direction is a real challenge, especially for beginners. There were also jokes about trying it themselves and not getting very far—just like the article’s writer. Overall, people enjoyed the article and the idea that humans are still learning new ways to move in water.

## A better Ghidra MCP server – GhidrAssistMCP

- 原文链接: [A better Ghidra MCP server – GhidrAssistMCP](https://github.com/jtang613/GhidrAssistMCP)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44543913)

This article talks about GhidrAssistMCP, a new extension for Ghidra that lets AI tools talk to Ghidra using a standard protocol called MCP. GhidrAssistMCP acts as a bridge, so other programs—even AI assistants—can control and read from Ghidra more easily. 

The extension works by setting up an MCP server inside Ghidra. It comes with 31 built-in tools, like listing functions, data, imports, exports, and analyzing code. You can enable or disable each tool, and settings are saved for next time. There’s a clear user interface to see what’s running and to manage these tools. Logging is available, so you can watch requests and responses as they happen.

To install, you just download the zip file, add it as an extension in Ghidra, and enable the plugin. You can also build from source if you want. After setup, you can open a control panel to set the server address and port, and turn the server on or off. There’s a configuration tab to manage which tools are active.

The tools let you do things like get program info, list and search functions, decompile code, rename items, and even create structures from variable usage. Everything is accessible through simple API calls—examples are given using JSON. The extension follows good software practices, like using observer patterns for the UI, keeping things thread-safe, and allowing dynamic tool registration. Developers can add their own custom tools by following the provided interface and registering them.

Troubleshooting tips are included for common problems, like server startup issues or missing tools. Debug mode can be enabled for deeper logs. The project is open source under the MIT license, and contributions are welcome.

In the comments, many users are happy to see more ways for Ghidra to work with AI and automation tools. Some people are excited because this could make reverse engineering faster, especially when using large language models to help understand binary code. Others ask about security: opening a server inside Ghidra could be risky if not protected, so they suggest careful firewall and port settings. A few developers note it’s now easier to script Ghidra from outside, which was hard before. Some users want to see more documentation and real-world usage examples, especially about how to connect with AI assistants. One commenter wonders if this could help automate malware analysis. Another says the plugin architecture looks clean and easy to extend, which is good for teams who want to add custom tools. However, there are warnings about possible bugs with new Ghidra releases, so users should check compatibility. Overall, the mood is positive—people see this as a step forward for both Ghidra and reverse engineering automation.

## Proposed NOAA Budget Kills Program Designed to Prevent Satellite Collisions

- 原文链接: [Proposed NOAA Budget Kills Program Designed to Prevent Satellite Collisions](https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-news/proposed-noaa-budget-kills-program-to-prevent-satellite-collisions/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44543150)

The article explains that the U.S. government wants to stop funding a program called TraCCS, which helps stop satellites from crashing into each other. TraCCS was started to give free, clear data about where satellites are, so companies and governments can avoid accidents in space.

Today, there are almost 12,000 satellites in orbit, much more than a few years ago. The Department of Defense used to manage this satellite data, but as the number grew, it was too much for them to handle while focusing on national security. TraCCS was built to solve this problem and make space safer for everyone, but now, the White House wants to cut its $55 million yearly budget to save money.

Experts and people in the industry think this is a bad idea. TraCCS is supposed to be like the FAA for space, making sure everyone follows the same rules and uses the same information. If private companies take over, each company might use its own system, which can cause confusion and accidents, just like if airlines used different air traffic control systems. Other countries, like China and those in Europe, already give free satellite tracking data. Cutting TraCCS could make U.S. companies less competitive and maybe force them to work with foreign services.

Many American space companies are worried. Over 400 companies wrote a letter to Congress asking to keep TraCCS. They say private companies can’t handle all international needs, and if the program ends, the military will have to take over again, which is not ideal because they might hide some data for security reasons.

The decision is not final yet. Congress will still talk about it, and the space industry is pushing hard to keep this program. If TraCCS is cut, experts warn that space will become more dangerous as more satellites are launched.

In the comments, some people think giving the job to private companies is good, saying it could be a “win-win.” Others strongly disagree, arguing that private companies only care about profit and might not act in everyone’s interest. One commenter compares TraCCS to the FAA, saying a single, trusted system is better for safety. There’s also worry that cutting government jobs will hurt people, lower wages, and hurt progress in science. Some are frustrated with the government, saying leaders care more about money than science or safety. Still, one person says they are happy with the current changes. Overall, the comments show a big debate between trusting business or keeping things under government control for safety and the common good.
