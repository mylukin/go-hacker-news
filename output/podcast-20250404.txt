Hello! Welcome to Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today we will talk about a few interesting topics from the tech world.

First, let's talk about Microsoft celebrating 50 years since it started. Bill Gates shares that he and Paul Allen created their first product for a computer called the Altair 8800 in 1975. They used a simple language called BASIC to make the computer understand commands. This first product helped Microsoft grow into a big company. Many people discuss how Microsoft and its founders were smart in both technology and business.

Next, we have a story about a project where you can build a simple computer from scratch. This project is led by Ben Eater and teaches people about electronics. The computer is basic and can run simple programs, but it is a fun way to learn. Some people think it is not very practical today, while others enjoy the challenge and learning experience.

We also have a story about a new antibiotic found in a garden. This antibiotic is special because it can kill bacteria that other medicines cannot. It is safe for humans and could help fight bacteria that are becoming resistant to common drugs. People talk about the use of antibiotics in farming and the importance of finding new medicines.

Another interesting topic is about a tool called Hatchet, which helps apps manage tasks without slowing down. Hatchet can run many tasks at the same time and ensure they finish properly. It's open source, meaning anyone can use it and make changes. People find it helpful and share ideas to improve it.

Lastly, we discuss how Microsoft used AI to find security problems in bootloaders, which are small programs that start a computer. They found issues that could let bad people run harmful code. Microsoft worked with others to fix these problems. Some people worry about Microsoft having too much control over security, while others think their work helps improve safety.
