## Why does C have the best file API

- 原文链接: [Why does C have the best file API](https://maurycyz.com/misc/c_files/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47209788)

This article talks about why the C programming language has a very good way to work with files. The author says that, in C, you can treat a file almost like normal memory and use it directly with your data structures.

The main point is about “memory mapping.” In C, you can use mmap() to map a file into your program’s memory space. This means you can read and change parts of a very big file just like an array, even if the file is bigger than your computer’s RAM. The system only loads the parts you use. You do not need to write code to read, parse, or write the file in small pieces. With memory mapping, you can work with all types of data, and the system manages caching for you. When the system needs memory, it can remove parts of the cache automatically.

The author says that other languages often only give simple functions for reading or writing files and then make you do extra work like parsing or serializing. Even if these languages have memory mapping, it’s usually only for raw bytes, so you still need to convert the bytes into useful data. In many cases, people end up writing a lot of code just to move data between files and memory.

The article also points out that C’s way is not perfect. It does not handle things like endianness (the order of bytes), and there is some system overhead. But even with problems, it is still much better than nothing. The author thinks programmers should not always need to parse and validate data every time, especially when files are too big to load all at once.

He gives an example with Python’s pickle, which is insecure but popular because it is easy to use. Other languages often make working with files harder than it should be. The author also says that people often use databases like SQLite just to get better file handling, but this brings other problems and extra work.

In the Hacker News comments, many people agree that C’s mmap is powerful and simple. Some think other languages avoid these features for safety reasons. For example, direct memory access can be risky, and bugs can cause crashes or security problems. Others say that high-level languages focus on safety and portability, which makes file access harder but safer. Some commenters point out that Rust and Go can also do memory mapping, but it is not as easy as in C. A few people think most programs do not need such low-level file access and are happy with the simple APIs in other languages. Some users like that C gives full control, while others prefer the safety and features of higher-level file handling. There is also debate about when to use a database versus the filesystem, with some saying files are fine for most things, and others saying databases are better for complex needs. Overall, people agree that C’s file API is unique, but not everyone thinks it is the best for every job.

## Microgpt

- 原文链接: [Microgpt](http://karpathy.github.io/2026/02/12/microgpt/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47202708)

This article is about “microgpt,” a small Python program (about 200 lines) that trains and runs a GPT-like language model without any extra libraries. The author, Andrej Karpathy, wanted to show the core ideas behind large language models in the simplest way possible.

The script downloads a simple dataset—a list of 32,000 names—and the goal is for the model to learn patterns in these names and generate new, similar names. It works by first turning each character into a number (a process called tokenization). Then, it builds a small neural network using basic Python code, including an autograd engine for automatic differentiation—this is what lets the model learn by adjusting its parameters.

The script sets up all the model’s parameters (the numbers the model tweaks to get better) in small arrays, just like big models do, but with much fewer numbers. The model’s architecture is similar to GPT-2, but much smaller: it uses attention layers (so each letter can “look back” at previous letters), an MLP (multilayer perceptron) for extra processing, and residual connections (which help with training).

For training, the script goes through each name, one by one, and tries to predict the next letter. It uses a cross-entropy loss function to see how well it’s doing. It uses the Adam optimizer (a standard technique) to update the model’s parameters so that its predictions get better over time. After training, the model can generate brand new names by sampling one letter at a time, using its learned knowledge. You can run this script in Python with no extra installs, or try it in Google Colab.

The article explains that, though this is a tiny model, the core ideas are the same as in giant models like ChatGPT—just scaled up with more data, bigger networks, and lots of engineering for speed and quality. There’s even a breakdown of how production models differ: bigger datasets, smarter tokenization, faster hardware, deeper architectures, and careful training tricks. But the “essence” is the same: predicting the next token.

In the comments, many people are impressed by how simple and clear the code is. Some say it’s a great way to learn how transformers really work, especially for people who don’t want to read huge codebases or math-heavy papers. Others like that you can easily play with the code, change the dataset (for example, use city names or Pokémon names), and see what happens.

Some commenters discuss how this helps demystify large language models. They say that seeing the full pipeline—tokenizer, model, training loop—in a short script makes LLMs feel less mysterious or magical. A few people point out this could be useful for teaching or for people new to machine learning.

There are comments about the limitations too: the model is very slow (since it’s pure Python and works on single numbers, not fast arrays), and it can only handle short, simple datasets. Some worry beginners might expect too much from such a small model. Others remember similar “tiny GPT” projects and appreciate how this one connects all the core ideas in one place.

A handful of users debate whether such minimal code is really useful beyond learning, since real-world models need efficiency and lots of extra tricks. But many agree that understanding the basics helps you appreciate the engineering challenges in scaling up.

Overall, readers find microgpt a helpful, hands-on way to learn how language models really work, and they praise the author for making something so clear and accessible.

## Microgpt explained interactively

- 原文链接: [Microgpt explained interactively](https://growingswe.com/blog/microgpt)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47205208)

This article explains how MicroGPT, a small GPT model written in 200 lines of Python by Andrej Karpathy, really works. It breaks down each part for beginners, using simple examples and interactive steps.

First, MicroGPT trains on a list of 32,000 human names. Its goal is to learn patterns in these names so it can make up new ones that sound real. The model treats each name as a sequence of characters, turning each letter into a number with a tokenizer. For example, “a” might be 0, “b” is 1, and so on, plus a special “BOS” token for the start and end.

The main task is to predict the next character, given the ones before it. The model slides along each name, always trying to guess what comes next. For each guess, it gives a score (logit) for every possible next character. These scores are turned into probabilities using softmax, making sure they add up to 1.

To see how good its guesses are, the model uses cross-entropy loss—a way to measure surprise, or how unlikely the correct answer seemed. If the model was confident and right, the loss is low; if it was wrong, the loss is high.

To learn, the model uses backpropagation. Every calculation is tracked so the model can figure out how much each parameter (number it can change) affects the final loss. Then it adjusts its parameters to do a little better next time, using the Adam optimizer for smart updates.

Characters are represented by “embedding” vectors—lists of numbers that the model can tweak during training. The model also uses another embedding for the position of each character, because “a” at the start of a name might be different from “a” at the end.

The most important part is attention. Each character can “look at” the previous characters, deciding which ones are important using queries, keys, and values. This lets the model gather information from the whole context, not just the one before.

The model runs each token through several steps: embedding, attention, normalization, a small neural network (MLP), and finally a layer that predicts the next character. Residual connections and normalization help the model learn better and faster.

Training runs many times. At first, the model produces random names, but as it learns, the names it generates start to sound more real. When making names after training, the model starts with BOS, predicts the next character, and keeps going until it predicts BOS again.

The article says the difference between MicroGPT and big models like ChatGPT is mostly scale: more data, bigger vocabularies, more parameters, and running on GPUs. The core idea—predict the next token and learn from mistakes—is the same.

In the comments, people like how clear and interactive the explanation is. Some say this article, together with Karpathy’s code, helped them finally “get” how transformers work. Others appreciate seeing the full training loop and backpropagation written out simply, not hidden by big frameworks like PyTorch.

A few commenters point out that while MicroGPT is great for learning, it’s not practical for real-world tasks because it’s slow and only works with tiny datasets. Some wish there were more examples with real text, not just names.

Others talk about the tokenizer, saying that while character-level models are simple, real models use more complex tokenization for speed and efficiency. Some ask about adding features like layer normalization or dropout, and how those would fit into such a small script.

There are also comments asking about the limits of this approach—how big could you make a model in plain Python before it gets too slow? Some mention that understanding this code helps when reading or debugging large-scale GPT implementations.

A few users say they’ll use this article to teach students or junior developers, since it’s so easy to follow. Some even share their own tweaks and experiments with MicroGPT, like trying different datasets or adding more layers.

Overall, people agree the article is a great resource for understanding the basics of GPT models, especially for visual learners and beginners.

## When does MCP make sense vs CLI?

- 原文链接: [When does MCP make sense vs CLI?](https://ejholmes.github.io/2026/02/28/mcp-is-dead-long-live-the-cli.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47208398)

This article talks about the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and compares it to using command-line interfaces (CLI) when working with AI models like Claude. The author says MCP is becoming less useful, while CLIs remain strong and preferred.

The main idea is that large language models (LLMs) like Claude are very good at using command-line tools. They already know how to use many CLI commands because they have seen lots of examples during training. The author says MCP promised a better way for LLMs to talk to services, but in real life, it does not help much. You still need to write documentation and teach the LLM how to use the tool, just like with a CLI.

Another point is that CLIs are good for both people and machines. If something goes wrong, a person can run the same command and see what happened. With MCP, it's harder because the tool only works inside the AI chat, and debugging means looking through logs or special formats. CLIs also work well together; you can chain commands with pipes and other tools like `jq` or `grep`, making tasks easier and faster.

The author also says authentication (auth) is easier with CLIs. Tools like `aws` or `gh` already have good ways to handle login and security. MCP adds extra steps and makes auth more complicated.

CLIs are simple because they are just programs you run when you need them. MCP servers run in the background, can fail to start, and sometimes need to be restarted. This can cause problems and waste time.

The article also lists practical problems with MCP: starting up can be unreliable, you have to authenticate too many times, and it’s hard to control access in a detailed way. With CLIs, you can give permission for just one command, but with MCP, it’s all or nothing.

The author admits that MCP can make sense if there is no CLI for a tool, or if a standard interface is needed for special cases. But for most work, CLI is easier, faster, and better for both people and AIs.

In the comments, some people agree that CLIs are easier to debug and more flexible. They say CLIs are well-known and work everywhere, so both humans and AIs can use them. Others point out that MCP might be useful for tools without a CLI or where security rules are very strict. Some say MCP could be better for cloud-only services or when you want to control exactly what the AI can do.

A few people think MCP is good for making things more standard, so every tool looks the same to the AI. But others reply that this does not matter much if the AI is already smart enough to use CLIs. Some share stories about trouble with MCP servers failing or being hard to set up. Others remind us that not every tool has a good CLI, so sometimes MCP is needed.

Overall, most commenters agree that CLIs are simple, powerful, and easy to use for both humans and AIs. Some still see a place for MCP, but only for special needs. The main message is: use CLIs when possible—they just work.

## Why XML tags are so fundamental to Claude

- 原文链接: [Why XML tags are so fundamental to Claude](https://glthr.com/XML-fundamental-to-Claude)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47207236)

The article talks about why XML tags are important for Claude, an AI language model. It explains that Claude uses XML tags in prompts and training, not just as a small feature but as a core part of how it understands and organizes information.

The writer says that using XML tags in prompts helps Claude understand instructions better. For example, if you put your request inside special XML tags, Claude gives much better answers. This is because XML tags act like clear markers or “delimiters,” showing where one part of the message ends and another begins. Claude’s API and docs suggest using these tags for best results.

The article compares these tags to quotation marks in English, which show when someone is speaking or quoting another person. It also mentions that this idea of using markers to separate information is common in many languages, even in things like DNA and ancient poems. The author thinks that any language, human or computer, needs a way to signal changes in meaning or level, like moving from normal text to a quote or command.

There’s an example from an AWS course: if you don’t use clear delimiters, Claude might get confused about what text is part of an email and what is just the prompt. XML tags help keep these parts separate. The writer says it doesn’t matter that the tags are XML—other models use different symbols—but what matters is that Claude is trained to notice and use these markers.

Claude is special, the author argues, because it was built to really understand these delimiters. This makes it better at dealing with complex, layered instructions and communication.

In the comments, some people agree, saying they have seen big improvements when using XML tags in their own prompts for Claude. Others think the idea is not new; they point out that AI models often work better with clear formatting, and XML is just one way to do that. A few say that XML might be old-fashioned, but it’s still useful because it is simple and easy for both humans and machines to read.

One commenter notes that XML is not perfect; sometimes it makes prompts look messy or hard to write, especially for beginners. Another user likes that XML tags make it clear what is data and what are instructions, which can help avoid mistakes. Some people wonder if future models will use different or even better ways to mark up prompts.

There’s also a discussion about how other AI models use different delimiters, like special symbols, and whether these work as well as XML tags. A few users say they prefer using JSON or other formats. Some think the real point is about clear communication, not about XML itself. In the end, many agree that giving the AI clear markers helps it understand us better, whatever format we use.

## Operational issue – Multiple services (UAE)

- 原文链接: [Operational issue – Multiple services (UAE)](https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47209781)

AWS had a big outage in their UAE region because a fire in one data center caused a power shutdown. Many services, like EC2, RDS, and others, stopped working or had lots of errors, especially in one availability zone called mec1-az2.

The issue started early in the day when something hit the data center, causing sparks and fire. The fire department turned off all power, including backup generators, to put out the fire safely. This made all the servers and services in that area go offline. AWS told users to use other zones or regions if they could, and to restore from backups if needed. Some API calls, like AllocateAddress, DescribeRouteTable, and DescribeNetworkInterfaces, did not work unless users gave specific details. AWS said they were working on fixes and would update everyone every few hours.

By moving traffic away from the broken zone, AWS kept other zones running. Still, some users had trouble finding enough resources in the good zones because of high demand. AWS said recovery would take several hours, and some services would have a long wait to come back. As time went on, more services started to recover, but the main zone was still down for many hours.

In the comments, people discussed the risks of running everything in one zone or region. Some said it was a good reminder to always use more than one availability zone and keep backups in different places. Others pointed out that this kind of disaster is rare, but when it happens, it can be very bad. Some were surprised that a single event could cause problems for so many services.

A few users said AWS should be clearer about what “high availability” really means. Others argued that customers also have a job to design their systems to handle this kind of failure. Some were impressed by how quickly AWS communicated and tried to fix the issue. Others joked about the “cloud” still being just someone else’s computer—and sometimes, that computer catches fire. Some users asked technical questions about how AWS manages failover and power safety. A few people shared their own stories about cloud outages and what they learned from them. Overall, most agreed this was a good lesson to plan for the unexpected, even in the cloud.

## Long Range E-Bike (2021)

- 原文链接: [Long Range E-Bike (2021)](https://jacquesmattheij.com/long-range-ebike/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47165965)

This article is about building a custom long-range battery for an e-bike, so it can go much farther than normal e-bikes. The author wanted to use his e-bike for longer trips and to replace car travel, but found that standard batteries and speeds were not enough.

He first tried carrying extra batteries, but this was annoying and made the bike heavy and hard to ride. Then he learned about faster e-bikes (S-Pedelecs), but these needed insurance, had less range, and were less safe to ride in traffic. So, he decided to build his own big battery pack using 170 Samsung E35 lithium-ion cells, learning from many YouTube videos and doing lots of planning and safety checks.

He explains that e-bike batteries use special battery management systems (BMS), and companies like Bosch make it hard to use third-party batteries. To get around this, he found an external balancer with Bluetooth to monitor the battery. He describes buying parts, testing every cell, and carefully making the battery pack to fit inside the bike frame (not on the back, to keep the bike safe to ride).

Making the battery was hard work and a bit scary, because connecting many batteries can be dangerous. He tested each cell, built the pack with safety in mind, and did the welding at night to get steady power. The final battery has 2150 Wh of energy, letting him ride 130 km in one trip, and maybe up to 500 km in eco mode, which is much better than before.

He says the battery is still experimental, but it works well and makes his e-bike a real alternative to a car. He hopes to inspire others to do the same, and also wants big companies to make better batteries for people who need them.

In the comments, many people like the project and are impressed by the technical details and the long range. Some warn that building big lithium batteries at home can be risky and should be done with care. Others talk about problems with companies locking down their systems, making it hard for users to repair or upgrade their own bikes.

A few users share their own stories about e-bikes, with some building their own battery packs and others buying commercial solutions. Some think riding e-bikes is great for the environment and health, while others worry about the safety of home-built batteries if not done right. A couple of people ask about legal issues, since changing the battery or speed can make the bike illegal in some areas.

There are also tips from commenters about better battery cells, safer ways to build packs, and how to get around company restrictions. Some wish e-bike companies would listen more to what users want, like bigger or easier-to-replace batteries. Others are excited about the idea of using e-bikes instead of cars, and hope more people will try it.

## Decision trees – the unreasonable power of nested decision rules

- 原文链接: [Decision trees – the unreasonable power of nested decision rules](https://mlu-explain.github.io/decision-tree/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47204964)

This article explains how decision trees work in machine learning. It focuses on how these trees split data into different groups using simple rules.

A decision tree starts at the top and makes choices step by step, splitting data into smaller, more similar groups. To decide where to split, the tree uses a measure called entropy. Entropy shows how mixed or pure a group is: if all items are the same, entropy is zero; if they are mixed, entropy is higher. The tree looks for the split that reduces entropy the most, which means the data becomes more ordered. This reduction is called information gain.

The ID3 algorithm is one way to build a decision tree. It works by checking every possible way to split the data, then choosing the one with the highest information gain. It keeps splitting until there are no more useful splits, or until other stopping rules are met (like maximum depth or minimum group size). Another way to measure group mixing is the Gini impurity, which is similar to entropy but sometimes faster to calculate.

Decision trees are popular because they are easy to understand and train, and they handle outliers well. However, they have a big weakness: small changes in the data can lead to very different trees. This instability means they can easily overfit, or learn noise instead of real patterns. To fix this, people use techniques like pruning (making trees less deep) or building many trees and combining their results, as in random forests.

Hacker News commenters like how the article uses simple graphics and examples. Some say decision trees are great for explaining results to non-technical people, since the rules are clear. Others point out that while trees are easy to use, they are not always the best for every problem, especially with very complex or high-dimensional data. A few share stories of using decision trees in real projects, saying they are helpful for first steps but often need to be replaced by other methods for final results.

Some users discuss the difference between entropy and Gini impurity, noting that the choice often does not matter much, but Gini may be faster. Others warn about overfitting and suggest always using pruning or random forests in practice. There is also talk about the instability of single trees, with commenters saying that even a small change in training data can change the whole tree structure. A few share tips about hyperparameters, like limiting the depth or number of leaves, to make trees work better.

Overall, the community agrees that decision trees are a useful tool, but should be used with care. They like the clear teaching style of the article and suggest it as a good resource for beginners.
