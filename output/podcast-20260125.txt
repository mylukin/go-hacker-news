Hello everyone, this is the 2026-01-25 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have stories about OnePlus locking down its phones, tips for writing nonfiction that grabs readers, growing up in Canada, a posture-checking Mac app, a deadly train crash in Spain, hard lessons from running your own Bluesky server, using PostgreSQL as a Dead Letter Queue, running DOOM on wireless earbuds, problems with a famous research paper, and how AI is dividing the tech world. Let’s dive in.

Our first story is about OnePlus and OPPO phones. OnePlus has released a new update for models like OnePlus 13, 15, Ace 5, and some OPPO devices, that uses a hardware fuse inside the Qualcomm chip. Once you update, you can’t downgrade to older software or install custom ROMs. If you try, your phone will not turn on, and only a full motherboard replacement can fix it. Even using special tools like EDL mode won’t help. OnePlus hasn’t given any reason for this change.

This move is a big change for OnePlus, which was once famous for supporting modders. Their first phone shipped with CyanogenMod, a custom ROM. Even after merging with OPPO’s ColorOS, they kept some support for custom ROMs. But now, all current custom ROMs stop working on these devices after the update. Many users did not know about the fuse and have broken their phones trying to downgrade. The community warns not to update to versions ending in .500, .501, or .503 unless they are known to be safe. If you already updated, do not flash any custom ROM unless it is made for the fused version.

Technically, when you update, the phone checks the software version. If you try to install something older, it refuses to start. The fuse cannot be reset by software. Only a new motherboard can fix it.

On Hacker News, many users are angry and worried. Some say this hurts the “right to repair” and is a big blow to the custom ROM community. Others note that most phone users never change their software, so it only hurts a small group. Some compare it to Samsung’s Knox, which also uses a fuse, but does not brick the phone if you try to unlock it. A few defend OnePlus, saying maybe this is for security or to stop people from bricking their phones by mistake. But most feel betrayed, since OnePlus was once modder-friendly. People worry more companies will do the same, making phones harder to repair or modify. In the end, almost everyone agrees this is a big loss for power users and developers.

Next, we have an article about writing nonfiction that grabs attention. The author says most essays start with boring facts and history, which makes readers stop reading. Instead, writers should make readers care first, by showing why a topic is interesting or strange. For example, most essays about Venice start with slow background, but a better way is to ask a question like, “How did Venice feed itself, and why didn’t its enemies starve it out?” This creates a puzzle and makes readers want to know more. After grabbing attention, you can give the details and history. The main point: if you want people to read, you must first make them care.

In the comments, many agree with this advice. Some say they now notice how often introductions are boring. Others share tricks like starting with a story or a strange fact. A few warn that clickbait works, but only if you deliver on the promise. Some wish more introductions showed why something matters, not just what happened. A few writers admit they struggle with strong starts and want to try these tips. Some discuss if AI can ever write in a way that grabs attention. One reader says this explains why Wikipedia articles can be hard to finish—they start with dry history, not the interesting parts. Many agree: to get readers, first make them care.

Our third story comes from a writer who grew up in Canada after moving there as a child. They share how Canada helped their family with money, housing, and public services when they were poor. Free or low-cost programs at community centers, like swimming and skating lessons, helped them fit in. Libraries were open to everyone, and the writer remembers borrowing as many books as they wanted—something they never had in China. Charities gave toys and food at holidays, making special days magical.

The government also gave free or cheap tickets to museums and events, so the writer could learn and have fun even when their family had little money. When the writer grew up, Canada still helped with things like unemployment insurance and health care for their mother. They say being Canadian gives a sense of security and freedom.

The writer knows Canada has problems, like expensive housing and some public services falling apart. Still, they think Canada is better for families than the US, where many safety nets do not exist. They feel growing up in Canada made them more open and hopeful.

In the comments, some agree that Canada’s social programs are important and share their own stories. Others say it’s getting harder to afford living in Canada, and not everyone can use these services easily. Some mention that in big cities, waiting times for health care or housing can be long. There is also discussion about how Canada compares to the US. Some wish their country had more public support like Canada. Others warn these programs need protection or they might disappear. Many thank the writer for reminding them what makes Canada special, but also share ideas for fixing problems.

Next up, an app for Mac called Posturr, which blurs your screen when you slouch at your desk. The app uses your Mac’s camera and Apple’s Vision framework to check your posture. If you slouch, the screen starts to blur, and the more you slouch, the stronger the blur. If you sit up straight, the blur goes away. You can change the app’s settings, control sensitivity, and recalibrate your “good posture.” It works with more than one screen and tries to use little computer power. All posture checking happens on your Mac, and no data leaves your device. You must give it camera access, and the app is open-source and free.

In the comments, many find the idea clever and funny. Some worry it might be too strict or annoying if it blurs too fast. A few dislike the camera being on all the time, even if the data stays local. Others like that the app is local and private. Some suggest adding other alerts, like sound or pop-ups, not just blur. A few people wonder if it will work for all body types or in bad lighting. Some talk about technical details, like using private APIs for blurring, which could cause trouble with Apple’s App Store. Overall, the idea is seen as fun and useful for some, but maybe not for everyone.

We now turn to Spain, where a high-speed train crash killed 45 people. A new report says the track was broken before the crash. The Iryo train derailed and hit another train run by Renfe, the state company. Investigators found a 40cm gap in the track. Grooves on the wheels showed the track was already cracked. Most people who died or got hurt were in the front of the Renfe train. The crash happened about an hour after the Iryo train left Málaga for Madrid. The transport minister said it’s too early to know for sure, but if the break caused the crash, it was likely hard to find in time. This is Spain’s worst rail crash in over ten years.

On Hacker News, users had many thoughts. Some said more sensors and better track checks could have stopped the crash. Others asked why the broken track was not found, and if inspections are too few. A few noted that even with checks, breaks can happen fast. Some said both private and public rail companies must work together to keep tracks safe. Others brought up the 2013 crash and said Spain’s rail system is usually safe, but things can still go wrong. There were questions about who is responsible and if weather made the track weaker. Most agree that train safety is very important and learning from this crash is necessary.

Our next story is about setting up your own Bluesky (ATProto) account using your own server and domain, to see if real decentralization is possible. The writer found it much harder than expected. Setting up the server was easy, but making a cryptographic identity (did:web) was confusing because the guides were outdated. After lots of trial and error, and advice from Discord, they found a hidden step: copying a special key from a server endpoint and editing it into their identity document. Even then, things didn’t work. Deleting the account “burned” their identity, blocking their domain from using Bluesky’s central service, and only company support could fix it.

The author says ATProto’s key management is too hard for most people, with little support and poor documentation. They compare it to running a Mastodon server, saying Bluesky is even harder and more fragile.

In the comments, some agree the current process is too complex, and true decentralization should not need company support. Others say key management is always hard, but better tools could help. Some think Bluesky will get better over time, and that all federated systems have trade-offs. There are also doubts about whether true decentralization is possible if the company can still block users. Some say expecting end-users to handle cryptography will never scale, and most people will keep using centralized services. A few hope for better tools and guides, but others are not sure it will ever be easy enough. In the end, there is a split: some are hopeful, but many see Bluesky as not yet truly decentralized.

Next, we have a technical story about using PostgreSQL as a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for event-driven systems, instead of Kafka. At Wayfair, the author’s team processed business reports using event streams and saw many failures. They first tried Kafka DLQ, but it was hard to see or search for failed events inside Kafka. So, they used a special DLQ table in PostgreSQL. This made failures easy to see and manage. Each failed event was saved with its data, error reason, and status. The table used JSONB and had fields for retry count and timestamps. For retries, a scheduler looked for pending events every six hours and tried to process them again. ShedLock made sure only one retry job ran at a time. PostgreSQL’s “FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED” made sure different servers did not work on the same event.

This setup made it easy to see and fix failures using plain SQL. Bad events were not lost—they stayed visible until fixed, making the system more stable.

In the comments, some liked using PostgreSQL for DLQ, saying it made things easier to query and debug. Others worried about mixing DLQ and main data in the same database, which might cause problems as things grow. Some pointed out PostgreSQL is not built for very high message loads, so this works best for smaller teams. Others shared similar ideas using other databases or files, saying the main win is being able to see and act on failures. Most agreed it’s a smart, practical solution for real-world cases.

Our next story is a fun one: someone made the classic 1993 game DOOM run on a wireless earbud called the Pinebuds Pro. You can play DOOM through your browser, controlling the game running on the earbud over the internet.

To do this, the creator had to work around many limits. Earbuds have no screens, so video is sent out using a fast UART connection, not Bluetooth. They used MJPEG instead of modern video codecs, because those need too much CPU and memory. The Pinebuds Pro CPU was set to run three times faster, and many features were turned off to free up RAM. Regular DOOM needs 4MB RAM, but the earbuds only have about 1MB, so many optimizations were made. The game’s data file was also shrunk.

The setup has four parts: the DOOM port on the earbud, a serial server to bridge the earbud and web, a web server to manage players and stream video, and a web page for players. Because bandwidth is expensive, only people near the front of the queue get a direct stream; others watch on Twitch.

Hacker News users were impressed. Some said this is true “because I can” hacking, pushing old games onto strange hardware. Others liked that the code and instructions are open, so others can try it. There was talk about how DOOM runs on almost anything, and jokes about it being a test for new hardware. Some discussed the technical tricks, like JPEG encoding and RAM savings. One noted that Pinebuds Pro’s open firmware makes these hacks possible. Some joked about the frontend code, but said it added to the charm. Overall, lots of praise, curiosity, and classic DOOM jokes.

Now, a story about a management science paper with big mistakes that has been cited over 6,000 times. The paper’s math error changes the results and leads others to believe things that are not true. Some experts saw the problem early, but the paper still became popular and spread to business schools and research projects. It is very hard to fix these mistakes once they are in the literature. Even when people point out the problem, it takes a long time for others to notice. Researchers keep citing the flawed paper, sometimes without reading it closely. Peer review did not catch the error, especially since the paper was famous. The author hopes talking about these mistakes will help others be more careful.

In the comments, some are surprised the error was missed. Others say this happens in many fields, not just management. One says researchers are under pressure to publish, so they don’t always check sources well. Another thinks journals should correct or retract bad papers faster. Some say people trust papers just because they are popular or from big names. Others share stories of finding mistakes in their own fields. Some think the problem is with the system, not just one paper. One suggests using better software tools to catch errors. Another says students should learn how to spot bad research early. Many agree science works best when mistakes are found and fixed, but it can be slow.

Our last story is about how AI is dividing the software world into tribes. The author started out thinking large language models (LLMs) were just toys, but now uses AI for most daily work. They noticed debates about AI have become more like political fights, with people choosing sides and not having open talks. At first, many who liked crypto jumped on the AI trend, which made the author skeptical. Many smart engineers didn’t trust LLMs due to mistakes and slow speed. But in 2025, tools like Claude Code got much better, making it useful for most coding tasks, even for those who type fast.

AI can now find bugs, fix them, and even help with security and performance. The author feels unsure what it means to be a programmer when AI does so much. They point out that if AI can fix its own errors with more AI, it might not matter if it’s inefficient, as long as it’s good enough and cheaper than hiring people.

The article warns that developers still hold onto old ideas, maybe out of fear, and that tribal thinking stops honest discussion. The author believes nobody really knows what will happen with AI, and suggests everyone should stay curious, try things out, and have empathy for others who feel differently.

In the comments, one reader says they dislike AI but accept it has value. They refuse to use it until they have no other choice, thinking it’s not worth learning now since AI changes so quickly. The author replies this is fair, and that learning AI tools later was not hard for them, but they are glad they didn’t wait. Another comment comes from someone who loves working with LLMs. They compare it to learning to code alone, then with the internet, and now with AI as a helper. They warn you can’t trust AI blindly. The author says many feel the same excitement, but they still worry about how AI is changing software jobs. Overall, the comments show both excitement and doubt, with some people eager for AI, and others cautious, but open to change in the future.
