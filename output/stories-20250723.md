## CARA – High precision robot dog using rope

- 原文链接: [CARA – High precision robot dog using rope](https://www.aaedmusa.com/projects/cara)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44661846)

This article is about CARA, a robot dog built by Aaed Musa that uses ropes and capstan drives instead of gears or pulleys for its joints. The robot stands out because capstan drives are rare in quadrupeds and offer benefits like no backlash, high torque, and quiet movement.

To get the robot’s joints working just right, the builder needed an exact 8:1 gear ratio. At first, he measured the wrong part of the drum, which led to inaccurate ratios. After feedback, he learned to use the effective diameter—where the rope touches the drum. Even then, the rope’s squishiness made the ratio hard to calculate, so he tested two drives, measured their ratios, and used math to find the perfect drum size, finally getting a ratio of 8.000619:1.

CARA’s legs use a 5-bar linkage design, which is stronger, more compact, and less common in robot dogs. Each joint uses a capstan drive with strong Dyneema rope and powerful pancake motors. The parts are mostly 3D-printed, with carbon fiber tubes for the robot’s main frame. The electronics are run by a Teensy microcontroller, with a CAN bus linking motor controllers, a radio control for driving, and a 24V battery for power. The whole robot weighs about 14 kg and costs around $3,300.

Programming includes a homing routine for the joints, kinematics for smooth and stable movement, and a trotting gait where diagonal legs move together. CARA can adjust its body to stay level on slopes and recover from pushes. Stability is handled by an IMU sensor, and the control software tweaks the robot’s pose in real time.

The builder wants to improve the robot by using a bigger battery and tougher feet, since the current ones wear down on concrete. He also hopes to add things like wheels, a camera, or more sensors, and maybe make the robot more autonomous in the future. There’s a plan for a smaller, easier-to-build robot dog with a guide for others to follow.

In the comments, many people praise the smart use of ropes and capstan drives, calling it clever and elegant. Some are surprised at how precise and quiet the robot is without traditional gears. Others discuss the technical challenges, like measuring the rope diameter and handling rope stretch or wear over time. A few wonder about the long-term durability of rope-driven systems and if they could handle heavier loads or bigger robots.

Some users suggest improvements, like using different rope materials or protective covers to avoid dirt and damage. Others mention the cost—$3,300 is high for a hobby project, but much cheaper than commercial robot dogs. There are also questions about open-sourcing the design and if the builder will share more code or CAD files. A few commenters are excited about the idea of a smaller, simpler version for makers, while others share tips on gait tuning and stability control.

Overall, the community finds the project inspiring and full of useful lessons, especially for anyone interested in building their own robots or trying novel drive systems.

## The Promised LAN

- 原文链接: [The Promised LAN](https://tpl.house/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44661682)

This article is about a private, always-on LAN party called The Promised LAN, which is a network for friends to connect and play or share things together. The network is invite-only and has been running since 2021.

The article explains that The Promised LAN uses a special backbone network to link different LANs, so each group only needs to connect to a local backbone node, making it easy to manage. The backbone uses three main nodes running either Debian or OpenBSD, all connected with secure IPSec links. For security, it uses strong encryption methods like AES 256 and Curve25519. The backbone has its own IP address space, and the backbone nodes share information using BGP so that everyone knows how to reach all parts of the network.

For naming, The Promised LAN uses its own made-up top-level domain, ".tpl". Each new LAN gets its own domain name, and there are three root DNS servers, each on a different backbone node, to keep services running even if one part fails. Each LAN is expected to run its own DNS server at a specific address, making it easy to add new groups. DNS settings are shared using a git repository so everyone stays up to date.

For security certificates, they run their own certificate authority (CA) system, using certificates that last three years. This system is set up so that certificates are easy to manage and only work for their own ".tpl" domains. They use DNS to help automate certificate signing, so people do not need to send requests or wait for approvals.

In the comments, many people love the idea and say it reminds them of old LAN parties with friends. Some think the technical setup is impressive and shows a lot of care. Others ask why not use existing networks like Hamachi or Tailscale, but fans say this project is more private and customizable. A few worry about the technical complexity, saying it could be hard for new users to join or keep things running smoothly. Some people like that the group runs its own DNS and CA, while others warn this could be risky if not managed well. A few users note the use of strong encryption and open source tools, which they see as a big plus. Some commenters wonder if similar networks could be made for other groups of friends. A few people ask about games and activities on the LAN, and others are interested in joining or making their own version. Overall, the comments show a mix of nostalgia, technical interest, and questions about how this kind of network could grow or be used by more people.

## Major rule about cooking meat turns out to be wrong

- 原文链接: [Major rule about cooking meat turns out to be wrong](https://www.seriouseats.com/meat-resting-science-11776272)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44662757)

A new study says a common rule about cooking meat is not true. Many people believed you should let meat reach room temperature before cooking, but research shows this is not needed.

The article explains that people often wait 30 minutes to an hour for meat to warm up before putting it in the pan or oven. The old idea was that this helps the meat cook more evenly. Scientists tested this by cooking meat straight from the fridge and meat left out to warm up. They checked the final results for taste, texture, and how well the meat was cooked inside. The study found there was almost no difference. Both types of meat cooked in about the same time and tasted the same. The outside of the meat browned well in both cases. The inside of the meat was cooked just as safely and evenly. The only small difference was that meat from the fridge took a tiny bit longer to cook, but not enough to matter. The main message is you do not need to wait; you can cook meat straight from the fridge. This saves time and is just as good for taste and safety.

In the comments, some people were surprised and happy to skip the waiting step. Others said they had always cooked meat from the fridge and it worked fine. A few cooks argued that letting meat sit out still helps if you want a perfect steak, but most agreed it is not important for daily cooking. Some people pointed out that food safety is better if you do not leave meat out too long. Others said it depends on the size and thickness of the meat, with bigger cuts maybe needing more care. A few readers shared their own tips, like using a meat thermometer to get the best results. Some said old cooking rules are often just habits, not science. Many thanked the researchers for testing this idea. Overall, most people felt it was good news and would make cooking easier.

## Neil Armstrong's customs form for moon rocks (2016)

- 原文链接: [Neil Armstrong's customs form for moon rocks (2016)](https://magazine.uc.edu/editors_picks/recent_features/armstrong/moonrocks.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44660437)

This article is about the Apollo 11 astronauts, including Neil Armstrong, filling out a U.S. Customs form after returning from the moon. They had to declare moon rocks and dust when arriving back in the United States.

The astronauts landed in Honolulu, Hawaii, after their mission. The customs form listed the departure point as "Moon" and the flight number as "Apollo 11." They wrote down the moon rocks and moon dust as items they were bringing into the country. The form also asked about plants, animals, food, soil, and even snails, just like for any normal traveler. In the health section, they had to answer if there was any condition on board that could spread disease. The astronauts wrote, "To be determined," since no one knew if moon dust could cause problems. The article shares a copy of this unique customs form, thanks to a friend of Armstrong who once flew helicopters with him. The story also mentions that Neil Armstrong later taught at the University of Cincinnati and passed away in 2012.

People in the comments found the customs form funny and a bit strange. Some thought it was just a joke at first, but others explained it was real and the government wanted proper records for everything, even moon rocks. Many said it showed how serious and careful officials were, following all the rules, no matter how odd it seemed. Some readers liked the fact that the form asked about snails, making it sound even more absurd. Others wondered if the rules have changed for astronauts since then, or if they still have to fill out forms after space missions. A few commenters joked about what would happen if the astronauts had checked "yes" for bringing in snails or diseases. Some people admired the attention to detail, while others saw it as government bureaucracy at its finest. There was talk about how customs forms are made for normal situations, not for space trips. A few readers also shared stories about odd or funny customs questions they have seen when traveling. Overall, most people thought the customs form was a fun and interesting piece of history.

## Parsing Protobuf like never before

- 原文链接: [Parsing Protobuf like never before](https://mcyoung.xyz/2025/07/16/hyperpb/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44591605)

This article talks about a new Go library for parsing Protobuf called “hyperpb.” The author explains how hyperpb is much faster than other Go Protobuf parsers and even brings new ideas from another fast C library called UPB.

Usually, Protobuf parsers in Go are made by generating special code for each message type. This can be fast, but it has problems. For example, you need to know all types at compile time, and using many types can make your program slow because it fills up the instruction cache. Also, big switches for fields can be slow, especially for fields with high numbers.

UPB, the C library, solves this by using a table-driven parser, which is like a small virtual machine that reads tables to know how to parse messages. Hyperpb brings this idea to Go and adds more tricks to make things even faster. It is completely dynamic at runtime, so you don’t have to generate code ahead of time. Hyperpb beats other Go parsers in benchmarks, including popular ones like vtprotobuf.

The article explains how hyperpb works inside. It compiles message types at runtime and uses a virtual machine to parse messages. There are many optimizations: 
- Zero-copy for strings and bytes so it does not copy data if not needed.
- Smart memory use with arenas, so it allocates memory in blocks and can reuse them.
- Preloads for repeated fields, so it guesses the right size ahead of time.
- Custom maps for fields, which are faster than Go’s built-in maps in many cases.
- Special tricks for “oneof” fields, so it stores them more efficiently.

The parser uses Go’s calling conventions to keep state in registers, which is fast. It also uses virtual function calls in the parser loop, which is actually quicker than big switches on modern CPUs. The library can use profile-guided optimization (PGO) to learn which fields are common and optimize for them. Cold fields (rarely used) are stored in a special place to save memory.

The API is simple: you compile a message type, make a message, unmarshal data, and validate it. Mutating messages is not supported yet, as the focus is on reading.

In the Hacker News comments, some people are impressed by the performance numbers and the deep technical details. One commenter likes that hyperpb uses modern CPU features and explains why indirect calls can be better than switches. Some mention that Go’s C FFI is slow and messy, so a pure-Go solution is useful. Others are curious about memory safety and how arena reuse works without bugs. A few users ask about mutation support and whether write performance will be improved in the future. There are questions about how this approach might work in other languages like Rust or Python. Some worry about the complexity and whether it is easy to debug or contribute to. Others praise the detailed documentation and the openness to new ideas. There is debate if this much optimization is needed for most users, but some think it’s great for high-load systems. Finally, a few users are excited to try hyperpb in their own projects and plan to follow future updates.

## A diverse cast of rocky worlds around a small star revealed by astronomers

- 原文链接: [A diverse cast of rocky worlds around a small star revealed by astronomers](https://nouvelles.umontreal.ca/en/article/2025/07/22/a-udem-team-confirms-a-fifth-potentially-habitable-planet-around-l-98-59-a-red-dwarf-35-l/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44661862)

A group of astronomers found five rocky planets around a small red star called L 98-59, just 35 light-years from Earth. They confirmed there is a fifth planet in the “habitable zone,” where conditions might allow liquid water, which could mean life is possible.

The team used data from both ground and space telescopes, including NASA’s TESS, the European Southern Observatory’s HARPS and ESPRESSO, and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The planets in this system are all close to their star—much closer than Mercury is to our Sun. The smallest planet, L 98-59 b, is even smaller than Earth, and the third planet might be a “water world,” filled with more water than any planet in our Solar System. Two of the inner planets could have lots of volcanoes, like Jupiter’s moon Io.

The researchers used new techniques to get more detailed measurements from existing data, instead of needing new telescope time. This allowed them to find the fifth planet, L 98-59 f, which is in the star’s habitable zone and gets about the same energy from its star as Earth does from the Sun. The orbits of these planets are almost perfectly round, which is good for future studies of their atmospheres.

The system is interesting because it has different types of rocky planets very close together, and it could help answer questions like: What are super-Earths and water worlds made of? Can small stars keep planets with atmospheres? The team hopes to use JWST to study these planets more and look for signs of life.

In the Hacker News comments, many people were excited about the discovery and the possible “water world.” Some wondered if planets around red dwarfs can really support life, since these stars can be very active and might strip away atmospheres. Others talked about how amazing it is that we can learn so much about planets so far away. A few users discussed the new methods used to analyze old data, saying it shows how much we can still learn without new equipment. One comment noted that even with these discoveries, it could be a long time before we really know if there is life on any of these planets. Some people compared this system to TRAPPIST-1, another famous red dwarf with many small, rocky planets. A few users debated if these planets could keep water for billions of years, given their close orbits and active star. Others said it’s exciting for science and that it gives them hope for finding more habitable worlds in the future.

## Building better AI tools

- 原文链接: [Building better AI tools](https://hazelweakly.me/blog/stop-building-ai-tools-backwards/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44659921)

This article says we are building AI tools the wrong way, and it is hurting how people learn and work together. The writer believes that AI should help people think and solve problems, not replace the thinking part or make people less skilled.

The article explains that people learn best when they have to remember and use information themselves, not when information is just given to them. Learning is more about knowing the steps to do something (the process), not just facts. Most new ideas come from groups working together and improving on old ideas, not from one person creating something new alone. So, tools should help groups learn together and get better over time.

Right now, many AI tools do tasks for people after a button click, skipping the part where humans figure out what to do next. This is bad because it takes away the practice people need to become experts. When AI takes over the thinking part, people lose their skills, and then AI cannot learn from people anymore either.

The writer suggests a better way: AI should act like a teacher who helps you learn, not someone who does your work. A good process is: explain, demonstrate, guide, and then enhance. For example, in fixing computer problems at work, AI should help you remember the steps, show you how to do things, guide you when stuck, and help you make things better next time. AI should never just do everything for you or make it so easy that you stop thinking.

Even for writing code, AI should help you plan, test, and then code, not just give you finished code to check. This makes sure you stay involved and keep learning. The article also talks about using AI to help different teams work together better, like helping customer support talk to developers during big problems.

In the comments, many people agree with the main idea. They say that when AI does too much, people forget how to do things themselves. Some share stories about tools that make things too easy and lead to mistakes because users stop paying attention. Others like the idea of AI as a teacher or helper, not as a replacement.

A few people point out that sometimes, fast automation is needed, especially during emergencies, but they agree that humans should still understand the process. Some commenters worry that companies will not build tools this way because it takes more work, or because it is easier to sell tools that promise to do everything for you.

There are also comments about how this problem is not new—other technology before AI also made people lose skills. Some people think that the best tools are the ones that help teams share knowledge and get better over time. Others ask for real examples or case studies where human-focused AI tools worked well.

A few users warn that if we keep making tools that remove humans from the loop, we might end up with systems that no one understands or can fix. But most agree that making AI tools that help people learn and work together is the best way forward.

## What to expect from Debian/Trixie

- 原文链接: [What to expect from Debian/Trixie](https://michael-prokop.at/blog/2025/07/20/what-to-expect-from-debian-trixie-newintrixie/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44659019)

Debian 13 “Trixie” is the next big release of the Debian Linux operating system, set for August 2025. The article shares what’s new, what’s changed, and what system administrators should watch out for when upgrading to Trixie.

Many important packages get new versions: Python 3.13, GCC 14.2, Node.js 20.19, Docker 26.1, the Linux kernel 6.12, and more. Some packages, like Asterisk, are still missing. There’s a new tool called debian-repro-status to check if your installed packages are reproducible, which helps with security and trust. Pacemaker’s fence-agents have been split into separate packages, so admins must install fence-agents-all if they want all features. The usrmerge process is now finished, meaning older system paths are fully unified. The apt tool is updated to version 3: it now supports color output, has better-organized output, uses a new solver, and some new commands (like snapshot, modernize-sources, distclean). The old apt-key is gone, so managing repository keys works differently now.

Systemd gets a big update, now at version 257, with many new features and tools. Some changes, like new network interface naming, may break scripts or setups—admins should check the release notes. There are new utilities (like run0 for running commands as another user, and systemd-ac-power to check power status), and existing tools like journalctl and systemctl have many new options and commands.

The new Linux kernel brings better hardware support, security changes, and more syscalls. Kernel modules are now xz-compressed. The ntfs driver is now ntfs3. There are new packages for BPF development, Intel SDSi, and easier kernel testing. Some package versions, like puppet, may lag behind because the upstream maintainers are slow to support new Debian releases.

Prometheus and its exporters are updated, with several new exporters added. In virtualization, Docker, QEMU, Podman, and LXC are all updated. Vagrant is available, but its future in Debian is unclear due to license changes from HashiCorp. VirtualBox is not included in stable because of security support problems, and may not work out of the box due to changes in how the kernel handles virtualization.

OpenSSH is now version 10.0. DSA keys are no longer supported, and some files like ~/.pam_environment are no longer read for security reasons. OpenSSH now uses a hybrid post-quantum algorithm for key exchange by default, which should be more secure in the future. There are also new features like better configuration matching, new tokens, and better handling of SSH agent keys.

In the comments, some users say Debian upgrades are usually smooth, but remind others to read the release notes carefully, especially about breaking changes like the new network naming or the missing apt-key. Others are worried about package delays, like with puppet and Vagrant, and dislike the slow reaction from some upstream projects. Some users like the new apt color output and improved systemd tools, while a few say the many options might confuse new users. There’s discussion about how Debian’s stable nature is good for servers, but can be slow for people wanting the latest software. Some wonder if Debian will keep supporting so many architectures and packages in the long term, while others praise the community for keeping everything working. A few people point out issues with VirtualBox and hope for better support. Many agree that reading the full release notes is the most important step before upgrading. Overall, the feeling is that Trixie is a solid release with lots of useful changes, but admins should plan their upgrades carefully.

## Show HN: TheProtector – Linux Bash script for the paranoid admin on a budget

- 原文链接: [Show HN: TheProtector – Linux Bash script for the paranoid admin on a budget](https://github.com/IHATEGIVINGAUSERNAME/theProtector)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44662497)

This article is about “TheProtector,” a free Bash script for Linux that helps admins watch for threats and respond to them in real time. The creator made it for people who want strong security but don’t have a big budget.

TheProtector checks your system all the time for problems. It watches which programs run, looks at network traffic, checks if files change, and even pays attention to what users do. If it sees something bad, like a strange process or hacker activity, it can block bad IP addresses, stop harmful programs, and keep copies of infected files for later study. It also has tools for spotting malware using YARA rules, learning what “normal” looks like on your system, and catching hackers who try to hide. You can look at everything through a web dashboard, or get data in JSON for bigger security systems.

You can install it easily with a single command, and it works on most Linux setups. It uses very common tools like Bash, curl, netstat, and cron, but you can add extras for more features. The script is light on memory and CPU, so it won’t slow your server down much. It can spot many kinds of attacks, like crypto miners, rootkits, brute force login tries, and changes to system files.

TheProtector isn’t perfect. It’s not a full enterprise SIEM, only runs on Linux, and needs root access for the best features. It’s supported by the community, not a company, and is given away under the GPL license. The creator built it over a year in his free time and hopes it helps others who can’t afford expensive security tools.

In the Hacker News comments, many people liked the idea of a simple, open-source security tool. Some praised the clear setup and focus on real response, not just alerts. Others had concerns about using Bash for security, since scripts can be easier to attack or break. There were comments about the risks of running scripts as root, and a few people asked for more details about how it avoids being tricked by hackers hiding their actions.

A few users suggested adding more logging or using a safer language like Go or Rust for future versions. Some wondered if theProtector would work well on busy servers, or if it might miss things that more advanced (and expensive) tools would catch. Others pointed out that even a basic tool like this is much better than having nothing at all, especially for small businesses or home labs.

People also talked about how security should be for everyone, not just big companies with big budgets. Some offered tips for improving the script or making it easier for beginners. In general, the community seemed happy to see something free and useful, even if it’s not perfect.
