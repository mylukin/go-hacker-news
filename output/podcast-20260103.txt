Hello everyone, this is the 2026-01-03 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have a wide range of stories for software developers and tech enthusiasts, from the best personal blogs of 2025 to new tools in programming, creative hardware hacks, and big changes in tech policy. Let’s get started.

First, let’s talk about the five most popular personal blogs on Hacker News for 2025. Simon Willison leads the list for the third year in a row, sharing many short posts about AI and useful tools, always without pushing any product. His style—posting links with quick comments—makes it easy for people to join the conversation. Jeff Geerling comes in second; he writes thoughtful articles about hardware, Raspberry Pi, and self-hosting, never just copying from his YouTube channel. Third is Sean Goedecke, who quickly became popular with posts about shipping projects at big tech companies. He is known for having strong opinions and explaining company politics in a way engineers can understand. Brian Krebs is fourth, famous for his deep dives into cybersecurity. He’s almost always in the top 10, but one of his biggest posts this year was removed for being too political. Number five is Neal Agarwal, whose interactive art and web games made every post hit the front page—one game even became the year’s fourth most popular post.

John Gruber had his best year in a while at #6, and some bloggers like Mahad Kalam and Byran Huang made the list with just one very popular post. In the comments, many readers praised Simon Willison’s open style, while some said the list should include more team or company blogs. There was a lively debate about whether luck or quality matters more on Hacker News, and how timing affects a post’s success. Some users loved the mix of technical and creative work, especially Neal’s projects. Others wished for more recognition for lesser-known writers, but most agreed the list reflects what the community enjoys. People also discussed how reposting and being persistent can help a blog post finally get noticed.

Next, Microsoft has stopped letting people activate Windows 10 and 11 offline. Before, you could activate Windows by phone, entering a special code, which was useful for people without internet access or in high-security settings. Now, this phone method no longer works for the newest versions—you must connect to the internet at least once to activate Windows. Older versions might still work with phone activation, but not the latest ones.

This change is a big problem for some companies, like those with computers in secure areas or with equipment that cannot go online. There are worries about privacy since you now must connect to Microsoft’s servers. In the comments, many users are unhappy. Some work in hospitals or with old hardware and do not know what to do now. A few suggest using older Windows versions or searching for other workarounds, but others say this solution will not last forever. Some defend Microsoft, saying online activation helps stop piracy and that most users have internet access anyway. Others worry this will push people to look for illegal activation methods. Most agree Microsoft should give more warning before making such changes.

Moving on, C3 is a new programming language that tries to improve C, while staying familiar for C programmers. It works directly with C and C++ code, so you can mix them in one project. C3 adds a module system, operator overloading, contracts for better safety, and a new error handling system. It supports compile-time macros, generics, and even lets you use assembly language inside your code. Debugging is easier with detailed stack traces and safety checks.

Many commenters are interested in C3’s compatibility with C. They like the safer module system and contracts, and are happy to see simple operator overloading. Some like the new error handling, which mixes “Result” types and exceptions. There are some concerns that adding too many features might make C3 less simple, and people wonder if it can really replace C, since other languages have tried before. Some want to see more real-world examples and stable tools. Overall, people are hopeful but waiting to see how C3 develops.

Now let’s look at a creative hardware project. One article shows how you can turn a $25 Walmart Android phone into a mini Linux server. The writer explains every step, from installing Termux from F-Droid, setting up SSH for remote access, to running a Linux distro with proot or Andronix, and hosting a website with nginx and Cloudflare Tunnel. The article gives tips for keeping the server running, like using termux-wake-lock and changing Android’s battery settings. It also covers process management with Supervisor and multi-tasking with tmux.

In the comments, people are impressed with what you can do with such cheap hardware. Some say using old laptops or Raspberry Pi is more reliable, but admit phones are cheaper and easy to find. There are warnings about short battery life and security risks, since cheap phones may not get updates. Many like the creativity and share their own stories about running servers on old phones. A few ask about using iPhones, but others explain iOS is much more locked down. Most agree this is a fun, useful experiment for hackers on a budget.

Next, there is news about deep-sea mining for valuable metals like nickel, cobalt, and rare earths, which are needed for batteries and electronics. There is a rush to mine the ocean floor to support green energy, but scientists worry about the damage to slow-growing deep-sea ecosystems. Some studies show the ocean floor does not return to normal even after many years. Researchers are planning new missions to see if life can recover after mining, while companies say they will follow rules to protect the environment. Many countries are interested, so the race is speeding up.

In the comments, some people think deep-sea mining is too risky and should wait until we have better technology. Others say we need the metals for clean energy, and mining on land also has problems. Some ask if recycling old electronics can help. There is debate about whether strict rules will be enough, or if companies will ignore them. Many agree we know too little about deep-sea life, so it is risky to start mining now.

Let’s move to a story about POSSE, which stands for "Publish on your Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere." The idea is to post content first on your own website, then share copies or links to social media. This way, you keep control of your content, improve search ranking, and make sure your site is the main source. The article gives tips for making syndication automatic, using tools like Bridgy or IFTTT, and compares POSSE to other ideas like COPE and PESOS.

Commenters like POSSE because it helps you own your data and find old posts more easily. Some say it is too technical for most users and wish for better tools. There is discussion about whether just sharing a link is enough, and how RSS feeds do not always work with social media. Developers share their own setups, and most agree that owning your content is good, but the tech side needs to be simpler for more people to use POSSE every day.

Now, let’s talk about getting more colors from a Spectra 6-color e-ink display using dithering. The writer used an ESP32-S3 controller and different software patterns to mix the display’s six built-in colors and create new ones. By using simple patterns like checkerboard dithering, they could show colors like orange, lime, purple, and brown. Some blends looked better than others, but the results made the display much more flexible for static dashboards, signs, and art.

Comments were positive about this creative use of limited hardware. People liked the clear examples and practical advice. Some noted the slow refresh rate is a big weakness, but not a problem for static images. There were questions about how far dithering can go, and whether better hardware is worth the extra cost. Some discussed battery life and using lower-power chips. Overall, the community liked the DIY approach and saw many new project ideas using these displays.

Next, Sirius is a new SQL engine that uses GPUs to make data analytics much faster. It connects to databases like DuckDB via the Substrait standard and can speed up queries by 10× or more, sometimes even up to 60× faster than ClickHouse, without needing to change your SQL code. Sirius is open source and can switch back to CPU if no GPU is available.

In the comments, people are excited about GPU-powered analytics, but have questions about real-world use, GPU costs, and data movement bottlenecks. Some point out that standards like Substrait make it easier to add Sirius to existing tools. There are debates about GPU compatibility and comparisons to older GPU database projects. People are happy the code is open source and are waiting to see more public benchmarks. Overall, they think GPU SQL is interesting, but want to see more proof in real use.

Another story covers using large language models (LLMs) to control music software like Ableton Live with a tool called ableton-mcp. The author used LLMs to automate music production tasks, add new features, and even reverse engineer project files. They used AI to turn vocal recordings into MIDI notes and to answer music theory questions. The author made a mashup track as a test, learning Ableton faster than by reading blogs or watching videos, and shared all their code and notes online.

Comments were mostly positive, with people liking the idea of using AI to help with music software, especially for beginners. Some worried that too much AI could make music sound the same or take away creativity, but others were happy to see boring tasks automated. There were questions about technical details and safety, and some wanted to try these ideas with other music software. Many users were excited to see what comes next in AI and music tools.

Finally, we have Xr0, a tool that checks C programs for safety problems at compile time. With Xr0, programmers add special notes, or annotations, to their code to explain what is safe and what is not. The tool checks for bugs like use-after-free, double free, null pointer dereference, and use of uninitialized memory. Xr0 spreads safety information through every function call and acts like a type system for safety. It does not fix unsafe code, but checks it. Xr0 is open source and can check most C89 code, but has limits with loops and recursion for now.

People in the comments like that Xr0 makes C safer, and that annotations are clear and helpful. Some worry that adding and keeping up the notes will be extra work, especially in big projects. Others say that writing annotations might help people write better code, but only if they do not skip this step. Some compare Xr0 to Rust’s safety system, and like that it works with normal C. There are questions about support for newer C features and C++. Many agree that tools like Xr0 are helpful, but good training and careful work are still needed. People are hopeful, but want to see Xr0 in real projects.
