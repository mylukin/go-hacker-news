California’s governor just signed a new law called the Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act. This law wants to make AI safer and more open, while still helping tech companies in California grow.

The law says that companies making big new AI models must show the public how they are following safety rules and best practices. These companies have to put this information on their websites. The law also creates a group called CalCompute, which will help with research and make sure AI is built in a way that is safe, fair, and good for everyone. If there is a serious problem with an AI system, companies and people can now report it to the state’s emergency office. Whistleblowers who see dangerous things in AI are protected by this law, and companies that break the rules can be fined. The Department of Technology will look at the law every year and suggest changes if needed, so the rules can keep up with new tech and ideas. The law follows advice from AI experts and tries to fill the gap left by slow action from the federal government. California is already the top place for AI jobs and tech companies, and leaders hope this law keeps the state in front. The main goal is to balance new ideas with public safety and make sure people trust AI.

In the comments, some people are happy and say this law is a good first step for making AI safer. They like that the law is clear, has real rules, and protects whistleblowers. Others think the law could slow down companies or add too much paperwork, especially for small startups. Some say only very big companies will have to follow these rules, so it might not stop smaller, risky projects. A few worry that the law is too simple and does not do enough to fix big AI problems. Some people want even more rules, while others think too many laws could hurt innovation. There are also comments that California is right to act if the federal government is too slow. Many agree that transparency is important, but some are unsure if companies will really share enough information. Overall, people are split: some feel hopeful, and others are cautious about what this law will really change.

Claude Code 2.0 is a new tool made by Anthropic to help software developers write code faster using AI, directly from the terminal. It can understand your code, explain what it does, help with routine tasks, and even manage git commands—all with simple, natural language requests.

To start, you install it with npm, then run the ‘claude’ command in your project folder. You can use it not only in the terminal, but also in your IDE or by tagging @claude on Github. Claude Code can do things like explain confusing code, automate repetitive actions, and handle parts of your workflow that normally slow you down. There’s built-in support for bug reporting—you just type /bug to share issues or feedback. If you want to connect with other users, there is a Discord channel just for Claude Code developers.

The team says they collect some feedback and usage data to improve the tool, like when you accept or reject code suggestions, or when you send feedback using /bug. They promise to protect your data with safeguards: they keep sensitive information for only a short time, limit who can access your session data, and state that your feedback won’t be used to train their AI models. The documentation, privacy policy, and commercial terms are all linked for anyone who wants more details.

Reading through the Hacker News comments, many users are excited about AI tools that run in the terminal, because it fits well into their existing workflows. Some people like that Claude Code can help manage git and explain code, as these are common pain points. Others are interested in how good the explanations are—especially compared to tools from OpenAI and GitHub Copilot. A few are cautious about sharing code with a cloud service and want to know more about privacy and data handling. One user points out the importance of not sending private or company code to third parties, even with safeguards.

There’s also talk about the trend of AI moving into developer tools, with some saying it’s the future, and others worried about over-reliance on AI. Some users ask if Claude Code works offline, but the answer is no—it needs internet to connect to Anthropic’s servers. A few people question how well Claude understands large codebases and if it can handle real-world projects. Others suggest trying it out on open source code first to see how it performs. Finally, some are excited to see more competition in the AI coding assistant space and hope it pushes all the tools to get better.

The article talks about Loadmo.re, a website that shows creative and unusual designs for mobile websites. It wants to give designers ideas for making better mobile-first web experiences.

Loadmo.re has a gallery of more than 360 mobile sites, each with unique design ideas. The site’s goal is to inspire designers to use the special features of smartphones, instead of just copying desktop website styles. The creators believe most designers still work and browse on computers, even though most people now use phones to go online. This creates a gap between how designers think and what users actually do. Loadmo.re tries to close that gap by showing examples made just for mobile screens. The website lets people filter by tags and look through different pages to find inspiration. It also links to Instagram for updates and invites users to submit their own sites. Overall, the site wants to start more conversations about mobile-first design in the digital design community.

In the comments, many people say they like the idea of focusing on mobile design inspiration. Some designers mention it’s hard to find good mobile examples, so this site is helpful. Others point out that most design tools are for desktop, which makes it tough to create truly mobile-first websites. A few users worry that fancy designs might hurt usability or slow down sites on phones. Some share their own favorite mobile sites or tools. Others ask if Loadmo.re plans to show how well these designs work in real life, not just how they look. There are also comments about trends—some want more simple, fast designs, while others enjoy seeing wild, experimental ideas. A few people ask for more tags or better ways to search. Some wish the site itself was even faster and more mobile-friendly. Overall, the feedback is positive, with many hoping the site keeps growing and helps push mobile web design forward.

## Buy It in ChatGPT: Instant Checkout and the Agentic Commerce Protocol

- 原文链接: [Buy It in ChatGPT: Instant Checkout and the Agentic Commerce Protocol](https://openai.com/index/buy-it-in-chatgpt/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45416080)

OpenAI now lets people buy things inside ChatGPT using a new tool called Instant Checkout. This works first with Etsy sellers in the U.S., and will soon include more shops from Shopify. The main idea is to let users find and buy products without leaving the chat.

Instant Checkout is powered by something called the Agentic Commerce Protocol, which OpenAI made with Stripe and other partners. This protocol is open-source, so anyone can use it to let their own shop work with AI agents. For users, buying is easy: you ask ChatGPT for something to buy, see results, tap "Buy," check your details, and finish the purchase—all in the chat. ChatGPT does not change prices or push certain products; it only shows what matches your request best.

For sellers, Instant Checkout is a new way to reach many buyers. Sellers keep full control of their payments, orders, and customer support. Merchants pay a small fee for each sale, but users don’t pay extra, and there’s no extra cost added to products. Payments and orders are handled by the seller’s own systems, not by ChatGPT.

The Agentic Commerce Protocol helps different shops and payment systems work with AI agents. Merchants using Stripe can add this with just a little code. Shops using other payment systems can join in too, using special tools or by changing a few things.

OpenAI says this setup is made for trust. Users must confirm every step, payments are safe, and only the needed data is shared with sellers. The hope is that this system will be the start of new ways to shop using AI.

People in the Hacker News comments had many thoughts. Some are excited about the idea of buying things right in ChatGPT, saying it could make shopping easier and faster. A few worry about privacy, asking what data is shared and how safe it really is. Some developers like that the protocol is open-source and easy for shops to add, but others wonder if small shops will be able to keep up.

A few users question if ChatGPT will start to favor certain sellers, even if OpenAI says results are not paid or promoted. Others point out that this could lead to more impulse buying, since it’s so simple and quick. Some hope this will push other chatbots or AI tools to add shopping features too, making the whole space grow.

One commenter thinks the real power is in the agentic protocol itself, not just shopping, and that it could be used for other tasks. Another person is unsure if people really want to buy things this way, rather than using normal web shops. Some are curious about how returns and support will work if the sale starts inside ChatGPT. A few worry about scams, saying it will be important to keep the system safe from bad sellers. Overall, the comments show a mix of excitement, curiosity, and a few concerns about privacy and the future of shopping with AI.
