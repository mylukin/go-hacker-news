TrueVault is a startup that helps online stores follow data privacy laws easily. They are looking for someone who has been an eCommerce Manager at a Direct-To-Consumer (DTC) brand to become a Business Development Representative (BDR).

The job is about reaching out to other brands and showing them how TrueVault’s software can make privacy compliance simple. The company believes people with real eCommerce experience understand the daily problems of running an online store, so they can connect better with possible customers. The BDR will write emails, make calls, and use social media to set up meetings for the sales team. They will need to research brands, tailor messages to each one, and work closely with the team. The job is remote but only for people living in the US.

To apply, you must have worked at least two years as an eCommerce Manager, be comfortable talking to people, and be good at writing. The company offers $100,000 total pay ($70,000 base plus up to $30,000 in bonuses), full health insurance for your family, unlimited time off, 401k, HSA, and equity. High performers can get promoted within 12–18 months.

To apply, you need to send your resume as a PDF and write a sample sales email to a real company, showing your approach and style. The company promises to keep your data private.

Hacker News commenters liked how TrueVault wants real eCommerce experience, not just sales skills. Some said this mix of experience is rare but smart, because it helps build trust with customers. Others wondered if $100,000 OTE is enough for someone with this background, especially in expensive US cities. A few mentioned that working in SaaS sales is different from managing an eCommerce store, so the switch might be tough, but it could be a good chance for career growth. Some people liked the focus on privacy and hope more companies offer tools like this, while others were curious about the real challenges of privacy compliance for small stores. A few asked for more details about the company’s product and customers. Overall, many saw this as a good chance for someone ready to move from operations to tech sales.

## I turned the Lego Game Boy into a working Game Boy

This article is about someone turning a Lego Game Boy set into a real, working Game Boy. The writer explains how they know Game Boy circuit boards well and decided to try this project after joking about it online.

They chose to use the Game Boy Pocket (MGB) CPU instead of the original Game Boy (DMG) CPU. The main reason is that the MGB CPU is cheaper, easier to find, and has the VRAM inside the chip, which saves space. The writer says this is important because the Lego kit does not have much room. They also share that they used press photos to measure the Lego kit and plan where to fit the real Game Boy parts. The screen area of the Lego model will hold the main electronics.

The writer designed a special power circuit, using ideas from their other projects, and added a soft-latching power button for easier use. For the buttons and USB-C port, they made custom 3D-printed Lego-like pieces. The buttons on the Lego set can be pressed, so these are wired to work like real Game Boy controls. They show some pictures and short videos of the process, including how the buttons feel “clicky.” The project is not finished yet, but the builder says they will release all details when it is done.

Readers in the comments were impressed by the creativity and technical skill. Some people loved how the builder mixed Lego and real electronics, calling it a dream project for fans of both hobbies. Others asked technical questions, like how the builder got the buttons to work and if the screen would look good through the Lego window. A few worried about fitting everything in such a small space. Some said the Game Boy Pocket CPU was a smart choice for space and cost reasons. A few commenters shared similar projects, like putting Raspberry Pi computers into Lego cases. There was also talk about the value of open-source hardware and how detailed documentation helps others try similar builds. Some people just joked about what Lego and Nintendo might think of the idea. Overall, the comments were supportive and excited to see more updates.
