## JavaScript Demos in 140 Characters

- 原文链接: [JavaScript Demos in 140 Characters](https://beta.dwitter.net)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46557489)

The article is about Dwitter.net, a website where people write short JavaScript programs, called “dweets,” that must fit in 140 characters. These tiny programs create visual effects or animations in the browser, showing how creative coding can be even with big size limits. Each dweet is a small piece of code, usually starting with “function u(t)” and using tricks to draw or animate things on a canvas. Some examples use emojis or simple shapes to make interesting patterns. Users share, remix, and comment on each other’s dweets. The site sorts dweets by “hot,” “new,” or “top” over different time periods. There are also monthly theme challenges, like making something with the “cavern” tag.

Some dweets pack a lot into very little code, using compressed or even unreadable code to do more. Others are clever with math to create movement or shapes. Many use loops, math functions like sine and cosine, or special drawing commands. Some effects include moving popcorn emojis, waving flags, bouncing balls, or strange patterns. Users sometimes remix each other’s work, making small changes to create new effects. The site also has playful things, like a “Dwitter News Network” dweet, showing the fun side of the community.

In the Hacker News comments, people are impressed by how much can be done in 140 characters. Some say these limits push creativity and clever problem-solving. Others like that you can quickly see the result of each dweet—just run it in your browser and enjoy the animation. A few people talk about the math skills needed for these tiny programs, and some share that they learned new JavaScript tricks by reading dweets. There are comments about the joy of remixing: it’s easy to take someone’s idea and make it your own.

Not everyone finds the code readable—some say it’s hard to understand because of the tricks needed to save space. A few worry that this style encourages “code golfing” over writing good, clear code. Some wish the site explained each dweet, while others think the mystery is part of the fun. People compare Dwitter to old “demo scene” art, where coders made impressive effects on old computers with very little code. Many agree it’s a great way to learn, experiment, and see what JavaScript can do with just a few lines. Overall, the community loves the playful challenge and the creativity on display.

## QtNat – Open you port with Qt UPnP

- 原文链接: [QtNat – Open you port with Qt UPnP](http://renaudguezennec.eu/index.php/2026/01/09/qtnat-open-you-port-with-qt/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46558739)

This article talks about QtNat, a small C++ library for Qt 6 that helps your app open ports on routers using UPnP. It lets developers connect their programs to the internet easily, without users needing to set up their routers by hand.

QtNat finds routers that support UPnP and asks them to forward ports for your app. This is helpful for things like peer-to-peer apps, online games, or remote-access tools that need to accept connections from the outside. The library tries to make everything simple with a clean API. The main steps are: create the object, connect to a status signal, start discovery, request the router’s description, and finally ask the router to open a port.

The technical part starts with sending an M-SEARCH request to find UPnP routers. If a router answers, the library gets a URL for more info. Then, it requests the router’s description file using Qt’s network features. Next, it looks for devices like “InternetGatewayDevice” in the XML file. After that, the library sends a special HTTP request (with XML content) to the router to add a port mapping. If the router replies with no error, the port is open. If anything fails, the app reports the error and quits.

The code uses inja (a template engine) to build the XML messages. There are also some details about how the code checks for errors and updates the app status.

In the Hacker News comments, some people are excited about having a modern, Qt-based UPnP library, since many old ones are hard to use or not maintained. Others are careful, saying that UPnP is often turned off on routers for security reasons, so this approach might not always work. A few users point out that while UPnP is handy for home use or development, it can be risky for security, because any app on your computer could open ports without asking you. Some share tips about using similar libraries in other languages, and a few mention problems with certain routers not following the UPnP standard well.

Other commenters ask if this tool can also remove port mappings or just add them. There’s discussion about testing on different kinds of routers and networks, with some users finding that UPnP only works on their home Wi-Fi but not on work or mobile networks. Some people like that the code is open source and invite others to contribute or suggest changes on GitHub. A few warn that users should always be careful and know what apps are opening ports on their network.

## Scientists discover oldest poison, on 60k-year-old arrows

- 原文链接: [Scientists discover oldest poison, on 60k-year-old arrows](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/07/science/poison-arrows-south-africa.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46547962)

Scientists have found the oldest known poison on arrow tips from 60,000 years ago in South Africa. The poison was found on stone points, showing that ancient people used chemicals to hunt animals.

The scientists studied old arrowheads and found signs of a plant poison called ricin. They think early humans used this poison to make hunting easier. The poison would make animals weak or kill them, even if the arrow didn’t hit a vital spot. This discovery means people back then were very smart and understood how to use plants in new ways.

Before this, the oldest proof of poison use was much younger. This new find pushes back the date for when people started using poison. The team used special tools to look at the arrowheads closely. They found small traces of the poison, which was stuck in cracks on the stones. This means the poison stayed for thousands of years.

The article says early humans mixed plant juice with fat or other sticky things. They then spread it on the arrow points. These arrows were probably used to hunt big animals, like antelopes.

In the comment section, many people are amazed by how clever these ancient humans were. Some say this shows that people were smart long before farming or writing. Others talk about how hard it must have been to find out which plants were poisonous and how to use them safely. A few users wonder if the use of poison could have helped people survive when food was hard to find. Some point out that making poison is dangerous and that it might have been used in wars too. A few commenters talk about other old hunting tools, like traps and spears, and compare them to poison arrows. There are also people who ask if we can learn from these methods today or if they are too risky for us now. Some commenters are surprised the poison lasted so long on the arrows. Others think this discovery might help us understand more about early human life and survival.

## RTX 5090 and Raspberry Pi: Can It Game?

- 原文链接: [RTX 5090 and Raspberry Pi: Can It Game?](https://scottjg.com/posts/2026-01-08-crappy-computer-showdown/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46558148)

This article looks at whether you can play PC games on a Raspberry Pi 5 by connecting it to a very strong graphics card, the NVIDIA RTX 5090. The writer tests the Pi against two other small, cheap computers—the Beelink MINI-S13 (with an Intel CPU) and the Radxa ROCK 5B (another ARM board).

The main idea is that the Pi 5 can use an external GPU if you use a special dock and some driver patches. The Beelink is faster and uses an Intel chip, so it runs games more easily. The ROCK 5B is similar to the Pi, but has more cores and faster data lanes. The Pi 5 is the slowest, with the least bandwidth for the GPU.

To run PC games on ARM boards like the Pi, you need a tool called FEX. FEX lets ARM hardware pretend to be an Intel (x86) computer, but this makes everything much slower. The writer tests several games, from new titles like Cyberpunk 2077 and Doom: The Dark Ages to older ones like Alien: Isolation, Hitman: Absolution, Just Cause 2, and Portal 2. Most modern games barely run or are not playable on the Pi. Games from 2010–2012 sometimes work, but even then, the frame rates are low. Portal 2 is an exception—it runs very well on the Pi when using the native Linux version.

Power use is low on the ARM boards, with the Pi 5 using less than 9W under load, but the Intel Beelink uses more power and gives much better game performance. The article finishes by saying yes, you can play games on a Pi with a big GPU, but it is not a good idea. It only works for old games, and you do not need a super expensive graphics card for that.

In the Hacker News comments, some people loved the experiment and said it was fun to see the limits of cheap hardware. Others said it is not useful because it costs too much to add a $2000 GPU to a $70 Raspberry Pi. A few pointed out that ARM computers are getting better and maybe in a few years, gaming on ARM will be easier. Some users talked about the trouble of running x86 games on ARM, and said if more games were made for ARM, things could be smoother. There was also discussion about how much software like FEX, Proton, and driver patches slow things down. A few people wondered if a cheaper, less powerful GPU would give almost the same results, since the CPU is the real bottleneck. One commenter said the project is more about having fun and learning than building a real gaming machine. Another user joked that the Raspberry Pi is now the weakest part of the world’s strongest gaming setup. Some people shared their own stories of trying to game on old hardware for fun. Others hoped that as ARM gets more popular, like with Apple Silicon, support for gaming will get better. Finally, many agreed this is a cool hack, but for real gaming, a normal PC is still the best choice.

## Show HN: Rocket Launch and Orbit Simulator

- 原文链接: [Show HN: Rocket Launch and Orbit Simulator](https://www.donutthejedi.com/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46557879)

This article is about a new Rocket Launch and Orbit Simulator you can try online. The tool lets people run rocket launches and practice moving rockets into orbit.

You start with the rocket on the ground. The simulator shows numbers like altitude, speed, thrust, and fuel. You can watch each stage of the flight, see how fast the rocket is going, and check things like how much fuel is left. There are options to launch, pause, reset, and zoom in or out on the rocket. You can pick different missions, or just try launching for fun. There are two main ways to control the rocket: manual and guided. In manual mode, you tilt the rocket yourself using the keyboard. In guided mode, you choose a target altitude, and the computer flies the rocket for you. The simulator also has an “orbital mode,” so you can start with a rocket already in orbit and practice moving it around. You can do things like refuel, burn in different directions, and learn about how orbits work. The controls are simple, and the interface gives you advice about what to do next.

People on Hacker News liked the simulator and found it fun and educational. Some said it’s a great way to understand rocket launches and orbits, especially for beginners. Others talked about how hard it is to get a rocket into orbit in real life, and this tool shows why. A few users shared tips about how to reach orbit, like watching your speed and angle. Some people wanted more features, such as different rocket types, or real-world locations. Others talked about how it could be used in classrooms to teach kids about space. A few users said the graphics could be better, but most agreed it works well as it is. Some discussed the math behind the simulator and wondered how realistic it is. Others liked that you can control everything yourself, or let the computer help. A few people asked if the creator would open-source the code. Many thanked the creator for making a fun and simple tool to play with rockets and orbits.

## Turn a single image into a navigable 3D Gaussian Splat with depth

- 原文链接: [Turn a single image into a navigable 3D Gaussian Splat with depth](https://lab.revelium.studio/ml-sharp)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46557352)

This article is about a web tool that lets you turn one picture into a simple 3D scene using machine learning. The tool uses Apple’s SHARP model to guess depth from a single image, letting you move around the picture in 3D.

You just upload a photo (JPG, PNG, or HEIC). The tool uses SHARP to predict how far different parts of the image are from the camera. It creates a “3D Gaussian Splat,” which means it makes a cloud of colored dots in space to show the image in 3D. You can then move or “navigate” around this 3D scene with your mouse, seeing the photo from slightly different angles. The tool is for research and fun only; it isn’t for commercial use and doesn’t guarantee perfect results. It warns you to use images you own. All processing happens in your browser, and the tool uses open-source code from Apple.

In the Hacker News comments, people are excited about how easy it is to create 3D effects from just one photo. Some say it’s fun to see their pictures “pop out” with depth. Others point out that the 3D effect looks good for some scenes, but not for all; for example, photos with lots of flat or repeating backgrounds can look strange. A few worry about privacy since it uses machine learning in the browser, but others like that it doesn’t send images to a server. Some developers discuss how SHARP works, explaining that it uses AI to guess depth and that “Gaussian Splats” are a new way to show 3D data. One person notes it’s a cool demo for artists or game makers. Another wonders if this tech could help make virtual reality or video games from normal photos. Some people wish it could handle more complex scenes or let you edit the 3D results. Overall, most find the tool impressive and easy to use, even if it’s just a demo for now.

## The (likely?) cheapest home-made Michelson interferometer

- 原文链接: [The (likely?) cheapest home-made Michelson interferometer](https://guille.site/posts/3d-printed-michelson/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46492019)

The article is about building a Michelson interferometer at home for a very low cost, mostly using 3D-printed parts and cheap items from Amazon. A Michelson interferometer is a device that can measure very tiny changes in distance using light, and it is often used in science labs.

The author explains that buying professional optical tools is very expensive, so they wanted to see how cheap they could make this device at home. They used a 3D printer to make most of the parts. The main challenge was making the adjustable mounts for the mirrors, which need to be precise. The author solved this by using tension springs, screws, and nuts, most of which are easy to find and cheap. They shared the CAD files and instructions on GitHub for others to use.

The interferometer works by splitting a laser beam in two, sending each part to a mirror, and then bringing them back together. If something changes the distance in one arm, the pattern of light (called fringes) changes, and you can see this with your eyes. The author points out that this is a good beginner project for people who want to try 3D printing and simple science experiments.

The bill of materials is very short: you need some PLA plastic, two small mirrors, a cheap laser, a beam splitter (or even just a microscope slide), screws, springs, and rods. The total cost is under $3 if you use a microscope slide, or under $20 if you buy a real beam splitter. Most of the assembly is easy if you have a 3D printer. The author gives printing tips, like using standard PLA and basic infill. They also show pictures of the final device and the different parts.

In the comments, many readers say they are impressed by how cheap and simple the design is. Some people discuss other ways to build it even cheaper, like using old CDs or glass as mirrors and beam splitters. A few say that using a microscope slide instead of a real beam splitter works well for basic experiments, though the pattern is not as clear. Some users share memories of making similar devices in school or at home, and they like how 3D printing makes these projects much easier now.

A few commenters talk about the physics behind the device, explaining how small changes in distance can be measured because of the way light waves combine. Others ask questions about the stability of the setup, since cheap parts can move or vibrate easily. The author and others answer that it’s good enough for simple experiments and learning, but not for very precise science.

Some people mention that these projects are great for getting kids interested in science. Others suggest adding electronics or sensors to make the experiment more advanced. A few discuss possible safety concerns when using lasers and give tips to be careful. Overall, readers like the open-source files and the clear, friendly instructions. They say it’s inspiring to see science tools made so cheap and easy for everyone.

## Show HN: I made a memory game to teach you to play piano by ear

- 原文链接: [Show HN: I made a memory game to teach you to play piano by ear](https://lend-me-your-ears.specr.net)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46556210)

Someone made a web game to help people learn to play piano by ear. The game is called “Lend Me Your Ears” and you can play with a real MIDI keyboard or just use your computer screen.

The main idea is to help you listen to notes and remember them. The game plays some notes on the piano, and you try to play the same notes back. This helps you get better at hearing and copying music. You can connect a MIDI keyboard if you have one, which makes it feel like a real piano lesson. If you do not have a keyboard, you can use your mouse on the on-screen piano.

The game gets harder as you get better. At first, you might only have to remember one or two notes, but later you have to remember more notes. This is like the classic “Simon” memory game, but with piano sounds.

The goal is to help people practice listening and playing without reading music. This skill is called “playing by ear.” Some people find it hard to learn by ear, so this game tries to make it fun and easy. The game is simple to use and works right in your web browser.

In the Hacker News comments, many people like the idea. Some people say they always wanted to learn to play by ear, but found it hard. Other people think it is cool that you can use a real MIDI keyboard. A few people share tips about ear training and how it helped them learn music faster. Some users mention that games like this are good for all ages, not just kids.

A few comments ask for more features, like more instruments or harder levels. Some people wish the game would show which notes you got wrong, or help you with hints. Others talk about the technology behind the game and are happy it works in the browser. One person asks if it can help with other instruments, like guitar, not just piano.

A couple of users point out that ear training can be slow and sometimes boring, but games like this can help keep it fun. Some say they will try the game with their kids or students. Most people are happy to see more learning tools like this online.

## How will the miracle happen today?

- 原文链接: [How will the miracle happen today?](https://kk.org/thetechnium/how-will-the-miracle-happen-today/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46489514)

The article talks about small acts of kindness from strangers and how they can feel like miracles in daily life. The author shares stories from his youth, like hitchhiking to work and traveling across Asia, to show how often strangers helped him in unexpected ways.

He remembers people giving him rides to work, opening their homes, sharing food, or letting him camp in their yards. These gifts of kindness came from people who had no reason to help but still did. He noticed that kindness was everywhere, not just in one country or among certain people. The author explains that being open to help is important—you need to let yourself be helped, not just try to be strong all the time. He calls this being a "kindee," someone who receives kindness. He says that accepting help is its own kind of art, and that both the giver and receiver get something good from the exchange.

The author also says that life itself is a big, unearned gift. He suggests that instead of always hoping for good things, we should feel thankful for what we have. He calls this attitude "pronoia," which means believing the world is actually working to help you, not harm you. He believes that miracles of kindness can happen every day if we are open to them.

In the comments, some people agree and share their own stories about receiving help when traveling or during hard times. Others say that today’s world feels less open—people are more afraid to trust strangers or offer help, and hitchhiking is rare now. A few readers worry that accepting gifts from strangers can be risky, and that not everyone will be so lucky. Some think the article is too optimistic, while others say it’s a good reminder to be more thankful in daily life. There’s debate about whether kindness is common everywhere or only in some cultures. A few mention that technology, like social media, has changed how we help and trust each other. Many readers like the idea of being a good "kindee," and say they want to practice accepting help with more gratitude.

## Exercise can be nearly as effective as therapy for depression

- 原文链接: [Exercise can be nearly as effective as therapy for depression](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260107225516.htm)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46557233)

This article says that exercise can help people with depression almost as much as therapy does. Scientists looked at many studies and found that regular, light to moderate exercise can lower depression symptoms for many people. They compared exercise to therapy and medicine. Exercise worked about as well as talking to a therapist. It also helped about as much as antidepressant pills, but the proof for this was not as strong.

The review studied almost 5,000 adults with depression. People who exercised between 13 and 36 times saw the best results. Light or moderate exercise, not hard workouts, seemed best. No one type of exercise was the winner, but mixing different activities and adding some strength exercises worked better than just running or walking. Injuries from exercise were rare, and medicine had its own side effects like tiredness or stomach trouble.

The researchers say exercise is cheap, safe, and easy to do for many people. But it is not a cure for everyone. They also say it is important to find something each person likes and will keep doing. The studies were often small, so scientists want bigger, better studies to learn which exercises help most and if the good effects last.

In the comments, some people are happy to see proof that exercise helps mood, as they have felt this in their own lives. Others point out that when you are very depressed, it is hard to start moving, even if you know it will help. A few say exercise should not replace therapy or medicine for people who need more help. Some share that even small actions, like a short walk, made a big difference for them.

One commenter says society should make exercise easier for everyone, like safer parks and more free time. Others warn that telling depressed people to “just exercise” can feel uncaring or too simple. Some think doctors should talk more about exercise, but still offer other treatments. There are also people who ask for more research about which kinds of activity work best, and if group classes or being outside matter. Overall, the comments show people agree exercise is good, but they know it is not always easy or enough by itself.
