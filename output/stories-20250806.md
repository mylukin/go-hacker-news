## Claude Code IDE integration for Emacs

- 原文链接: [Claude Code IDE integration for Emacs](https://github.com/manzaltu/claude-code-ide.el)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44811567)

Claude Code IDE for Emacs is a new tool that lets you use Claude, an AI coding assistant, inside Emacs as if it’s part of your normal workflow. Instead of just running Claude in a terminal, this package lets Claude understand and use Emacs features like project management, code navigation, and custom commands.

The main idea is deep integration. Claude connects to Emacs using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This means Claude can see your files, follow your current selection, and even use Emacs tools like LSP for code help, Tree-sitter for syntax, and Imenu for jumping to functions. You get features like automatic project detection, session management, and full terminal support. Claude can help with code in the file you’re viewing, work with selected text, and show errors or warnings from Flycheck or Flymake. It also supports advanced diff views with ediff, making it easy to see code changes and related problems.

You can install the package if you have Emacs 28.1 or higher, the Claude Code CLI, and either `vterm` or `eat` for terminal support. There are many commands, such as starting Claude for a project, sending prompts, resuming sessions, and switching between different projects. You can run several Claude sessions at once, each in its own buffer, and switch among them as needed.

The tool is highly customizable. You can change where the Claude window appears, which terminal backend it uses, how buffers are named, and even which diagnostic backend is active. You can set extra CLI flags, add a custom system prompt, and enable debug logging for troubleshooting. It also lets you expose any Emacs command to Claude, so it can use project searches, analyze syntax trees, or run your own functions.

For people using git worktrees, each worktree is treated as a separate project, so you can have different Claude sessions for different branches. You can also add your own Emacs functions as MCP tools, letting Claude do special tasks you define.

In the comments, many users are excited about seeing LLM tools deeply integrated with Emacs. Some like that this is more than a simple wrapper—it really connects the AI to Emacs’ power. Others ask about privacy and if Claude ever sends private code to outside servers. A few wish it also worked with other models, not just Claude, or wonder if it could be made editor-agnostic. There are questions about performance, like whether the terminal integration is smooth, and if session management works well with big projects.

Some Emacs fans are happy to see support for both `vterm` and `eat`, since `vterm` can be tricky to install. Other users are concerned about the early development status, saying they’ll wait until it’s more stable. People who use VS Code mention that this kind of deep integration is what makes Emacs interesting compared to other editors. One commenter points out that having Claude aware of your code context and buffer state could make AI coding much more helpful. A few worry about the learning curve, since there are many configuration options and commands, but others like the flexibility. There’s also discussion about open source licenses, with some happy it’s GPL and others asking about long-term maintenance. Overall, there’s real interest in how this plugin might change how programmers work with AI tools in Emacs.

## Project Hyperion: Interstellar ship design competition

- 原文链接: [Project Hyperion: Interstellar ship design competition](https://www.projecthyperion.org)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44817539)

This article talks about Project Hyperion, a competition to design a “generation ship” for interstellar travel that would last 250 years. The goal was to ask teams to imagine a ship where people would live, work, and raise families for many generations as they travel to another planet.

Teams had to solve big problems: how to keep 1,000 people alive and happy, how to grow food and recycle water, how to protect everyone from space radiation, and how to keep knowledge and culture alive over centuries. The ship had to be self-sustaining, with artificial gravity created by spinning parts of the ship, and include places for living, working, and even spiritual needs.

The first-place team created "Chrysalis,” a modular habitat with strong radiation protection, flexible spaces, and a big dome inspired by sci-fi classics. They even thought about training the crew in Antarctica before launch. The second-place design, “WFP Extreme,” focused on culture—like clothing and spiritual spaces—along with technical solutions for safety and comfort. Third place, “Systema Stellare Proximum,” used a mined asteroid for shielding and told a rich story about community and shared values.

Many honorable mentions also had creative ideas. For example, one design used counter-rotating rings for artificial gravity, while another put a rotating habitat inside an asteroid for the best radiation protection. Some focused more on social systems, with unique governance models and rituals to help people adapt to life in space. Others worked on technical details, like modular construction, strong pressure vessels, and clever ways to manage waste and energy.

From the top comments on Hacker News, people were excited by the imagination shown in the contest, but also pointed out tough challenges. Some said the main problem is not building the ship, but the huge cost and time needed to develop and launch it. Others noted that, even with great designs, keeping a small society stable for hundreds of years is very hard—social problems could be just as dangerous as technical failures.

Some users praised ideas like using asteroids for radiation shielding, but wondered if it would be possible with today’s or near-future technology. There were also discussions about how to keep knowledge and skills from being lost over generations, or how to prevent boredom and mental health problems on such a long trip. A few users thought the competition was more art than engineering, but still valuable for getting people to think about the future.

Others liked the focus on culture and rituals, saying that community and meaning are just as important as food and air. Some wished for more technical details, like how to actually build such a huge ship, or how to power it for centuries. Overall, the comments mixed hope and skepticism, but most agreed that these ideas help us dream and plan for the far future—even if generation ships stay science fiction for now.

## Litestar is worth a look

- 原文链接: [Litestar is worth a look](https://www.b-list.org/weblog/2025/aug/06/litestar/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44816755)

This article talks about Litestar, a Python web framework for building web apps. The writer shares their experience using Litestar at work and explains why they now use it for almost every new project.

Litestar is async-first and uses type hints. The example shows how easy it is to make a simple web app with just a few lines of code. Litestar used to be called “Starlite,” but changed its name when it stopped depending on another library called Starlette. The writer compares Litestar to other frameworks like Django and FastAPI. They say Django is hard to make small, single-file apps with, while microframeworks like FastAPI are easy to start but get messy as your code grows. Litestar avoids the common problem of circular imports by using standalone route decorators, making it easier to scale your code from small to large apps.

Litestar also gives you strong tools for grouping routes and sharing configuration. You can register routes multiple times with different settings, like different authentication or dependencies. The article explains how Litestar is not tied to one way of handling data models. Unlike FastAPI, which relies mainly on Pydantic, Litestar lets you use dataclasses, Pydantic, msgspec, attrs, or SQLAlchemy models. It can create data-transfer objects (DTOs) from your database models, so you don’t have to repeat yourself and risk errors.

Litestar has good support for SQLAlchemy, which is a popular database toolkit in Python. It includes plugins to handle database connections and sessions, and works with Advanced Alchemy, a library that adds more features for SQLAlchemy. With Advanced Alchemy, you get ready-made classes for common tasks and generic repository classes for CRUD operations, which saves time and reduces code. The writer says that while they don’t like service layers in Django, they work well in Litestar because it’s less opinionated about structure.

Litestar has other nice features: authentication and authorization support, easy caching, good logging integrations, error handling, metrics for Prometheus and OpenTelemetry, and even support for htmx. All these features are built in or easy to add, unlike other frameworks where you might need to find many third-party tools.

In the comments, some people say they had not heard of Litestar before and are excited to try it out. Others compare it to FastAPI, saying they like that Litestar is less coupled to Pydantic and feels more flexible. A few users mention that documentation is important, and they find Litestar’s docs clear and helpful. Some people worry about choosing a less popular framework and whether it will have a big enough community or good long-term support.

One commenter says they prefer Django for big projects because of its batteries-included approach. Another points out that Litestar’s layered architecture is a strong point, especially for teams working on large codebases. Someone else asks about real-world performance, and another user replies that Litestar’s async support makes it fast enough for most web services.

There are questions about migration from FastAPI to Litestar, and a few developers say they switched and found the transition smooth. One commenter notes that the flexible DTO support is useful for complex apps, while another likes how easy it is to organize routes in Litestar. Some people still prefer FastAPI or Flask because of their larger communities, but agree that Litestar brings new ideas worth exploring. One person mentions that the author of the article is respected in the community, making their review more trustworthy. Overall, the comments show interest and cautious optimism about Litestar.

- 原文链接: [The new shape of Mixxx 3.0 – take part in the future of Open Source DJing](https://mixxx.org/news/2025-08-06-qml-project/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44818077)

Mixxx, a popular open-source DJ software, is getting a big update with version 3.0, moving its user interface from QWidget to QML. This change will make Mixxx easier to use, more modern, and better for different devices like tablets, smartphones, and touchscreen laptops. The new interface aims to help DJs customize their setup, improve performance, and be more accessible—especially for people with vision problems.

The team is redesigning the Library and Waveform views, so users can find songs and see waveforms more easily. Search features will get better, making it simpler to look through songs and playlists. There will also be new, interactive settings for things like audio routing and controllers, so DJs can set up Mixxx in a way that works best for them. The old, homemade theme system will go away, so the developers can focus more on new features instead of fixing old problems.

Mixxx also wants to work well for many types of hardware, from regular laptops to tablets and touchscreens. The QML technology helps make the software more flexible and improves accessibility options—especially for people who are blind or have low vision. The team is reaching out to the community, asking both developers and testers to join them. Developers can help by writing code, reviewing changes, and giving feedback. Testers can try out early versions and say what works and what doesn’t, especially if they have special accessibility needs.

Many people in the Hacker News comments like this update. They say QML is a good choice because it’s modern and supports nice graphics and touch controls. Some users share that Mixxx is one of the best free DJ tools, and they hope the new version will stay true to its open-source roots. A few people worry about the move to QML because it can sometimes be hard to learn or might have problems on older computers. Others point out that focusing on accessibility is a great step, and they hope Mixxx will listen to feedback from blind and visually impaired DJs. There are also comments from developers who are excited to help but ask for clear documentation to make joining the project easier. Some users want to see more tutorials or videos about using the new Mixxx 3.0 features. Overall, the community seems happy about the changes, but they want the team to keep Mixxx stable, fast, and open for everyone.

## A fast, growable array with stable pointers in C

- 原文链接: [A fast, growable array with stable pointers in C](https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/segment_array/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44815702)

This article talks about a new kind of array in C called a “segment array.” It’s a way to make arrays that can grow bigger, keep stable pointers to items, and work well with arena allocators. 

In a segment array, data is split into several chunks called segments. Each new segment is twice as big as the last one. When the array needs more space, it just adds another segment. This means the items in the array are never moved, so if you have a pointer to an item, it will not break later. The array keeps a fixed-size list of pointers to all its segments. This design helps with memory use and makes the code fast because you can find any item using simple math and bit tricks. For example, to find the right segment for an item, the code uses a fast “find the highest set bit” function. Adding a new item is also simple: if the current segments are full, it allocates a new, bigger one and stores the pointer.

The article gives code examples to show how to use the segment array with any type, using C macros for type safety. It also compares this structure to other options like classic dynamic arrays, linked lists, and arrays using virtual memory. The segment array is “growable” (can get bigger), “arena friendly” (works well with arena allocators), and allows fast random access. But, its memory is not fully continuous, so it’s not always as efficient as a normal array. In terms of memory use, segment arrays are about 75% efficient, while classic arrays can be closer to 100%. In the author’s experience, fixed arrays or a “hybrid” approach (build with a linked list, then copy into a big array) are often best, but segment arrays are great when you don’t know how many items you’ll need up front and want stable pointers.

In the comments, some people really like the clear explanation and the simple code. A few mention that this idea is used in other systems, like Zig’s SegmentedList, and in some memory allocators. Some say that stable pointers are very useful, especially for games or systems with lots of objects moving around. Others point out that segment arrays can waste memory if you don’t fill the last segment, and that memory overhead can be important for big data. Some users say the fixed-size pointer array (26 segments) is a smart limit, but others warn that you should watch out for edge cases on 32-bit systems. There are also comments about using similar tricks in other languages like Rust or C++. Some people worry about cache performance, since data is split across segments instead of being in one big block. Others ask about thread safety and how to free memory, but the author explains that it is simple to clean up if you’re using an arena. Overall, the segment array gets praise for being a good “middle ground” between fast arrays and flexible lists, especially if you care about pointer stability and don’t want to copy data around.

## 301party.com: The Intentionally Open Redirect

- 原文链接: [301party.com: The Intentionally Open Redirect](https://301party.com/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44817725)

301party.com is a website that gives you open redirects on purpose. This means you can use the site to send users or tools to any link you want, using different types of HTTP redirects.

The site lets you try different redirect codes like 301, 302, 303, 307, and 308. For example, you can go to /redirect?url=https://example.com&type=302 and it will send you to example.com. There are also shortcuts like /metadata, /localhost, and /passwd, which redirect to special places like the AWS metadata service, your local server, or even local files like /etc/passwd. You can also use DNS records, like localhost.301party.com, which points to 127.0.0.1. The project is open source and you can find the code on GitLab.

In the comments, some people say this is a useful tool for security testing. They use it to check if other websites or apps are safe from open redirect problems. Others warn that open redirects can be dangerous if used by hackers for phishing or attacks. A few people joke about how this site could be used to prank friends or test their own web filters. Some users are surprised that redirects to files or special IPs are allowed at all. Others share past stories about finding open redirects in large companies, and how these can sometimes lead to bigger security problems. Some are impressed by how simple the idea is, but also how it shows real risks in web design. Others think it’s a good teaching tool for new developers to learn about web security issues. A couple of users wonder if this might get blocked by browsers or security tools soon. There is also talk about the ethics of making such a service public, but most agree it is helpful for testing and learning.

## Writing a Rust GPU kernel driver: a brief introduction on how GPU drivers work

- 原文链接: [Writing a Rust GPU kernel driver: a brief introduction on how GPU drivers work](https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/blog/2025/08/06/writing-a-rust-gpu-kernel-driver-a-brief-introduction-on-how-gpu-drivers-work/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44813789)

This article explains how GPU drivers work, using the example of writing a Rust kernel driver for Arm Mali GPUs on Linux. It talks about how a simple program like VkCube, which draws a spinning cube, uses GPU drivers to show graphics on the screen.

First, there are two main parts to a GPU driver: the User Mode Driver (UMD) and the Kernel Mode Driver (KMD). The UMD is not privileged and runs in user space, translating high-level graphics commands (like Vulkan or OpenGL) into instructions the GPU can understand. The KMD runs in the kernel and connects the UMD to the real GPU hardware, handling tasks that need more security and control.

Shaders are small programs that run on the GPU to draw things like the cube. These shaders need data such as geometry, colors, and rotation. The UMD collects this data and asks the KMD to put it into GPU memory. The UMD then builds command buffers (sets of instructions) and tells the KMD to run them on the GPU. The KMD also keeps track of when jobs are done and makes sure different programs using the GPU do not interfere with each other.

The KMD is responsible for allocating and mapping memory, submitting work to the hardware, and notifying programs when their work is finished. Since GPUs do many jobs at once, the KMD must handle dependencies and schedule jobs so everything runs smoothly. It also starts up the GPU, makes sure it is shared fairly, and handles power management.

The article then lists the API endpoints that the Rust driver (Tyr) offers. These include ways to get device info, manage memory, create groups for job scheduling, submit jobs, and manage memory used for tiling (drawing large scenes in pieces). The API is simple, focusing on giving UMDs what they need to translate drawing commands down to hardware actions.

In the comments, some readers are excited to see Rust being used for kernel drivers, saying it could make drivers safer and less buggy. Others are curious about how Rust compares to C for performance and debugging in the kernel. Some people point out that most of the hard work is still in the UMD, not the KMD. There’s discussion about how hard it is to make GPU drivers because of complicated hardware and lack of good documentation from vendors. A few users ask technical questions about how memory is handled, while others want to know if this driver will help open-source support for more GPUs. Some wonder how this Rust driver will be kept up to date with changes in the Linux kernel. Overall, readers seem hopeful but cautious, interested in the technical details and the promise of safer, more modern driver code.

## The History of F1 Design

- 原文链接: [The History of F1 Design](https://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/43832710/how-f1-evolved-1950-where-headed-2026)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44816977)

This article looks at how Formula 1 cars have changed from 1950 to today and what new rules will bring in 2026. F1 cars started as heavy, front-engine machines like road cars, but big changes came when the engine moved behind the driver in 1959, making cars lighter and handling better.

Over the years, designers kept making cars lighter and stronger, using new materials like aluminum and carbon fiber. Aerodynamics became a big focus, with wings and special car floors to push the car down onto the track for more grip. Safety also improved a lot—stronger car structures, better crash protection, and devices like the halo now save lives.

Some famous F1 cars helped shape the sport, like the Lotus 25 with its new chassis, Ferrari’s 312T, and McLaren’s MP4-5. In recent years, cars have gotten heavier again due to hybrid engines and safety needs. Modern engines are super efficient, using both gas and battery power, and cars are covered in sensors that send lots of data. Brakes are also very advanced, needing high heat to work and huge pedal pressure from drivers.

F1 has also tested many engine types—V10s, V8s, and now V6 hybrids. Tires have changed a lot to handle more power. Aerodynamics keep getting more complex, but rules often change to keep speeds safe.

Looking forward, the 2026 rules aim to make cars lighter, smaller, and use fully sustainable fuel. There will be more electric power, active wings to reduce drag, and a new “push-to-pass” system for overtaking instead of DRS. The goal is better racing, less pollution, and more focus on driver skill.

In the comments, some users love seeing how F1 tech leads to safer, faster, and greener cars, and point out how ideas from racing often end up in road cars. Others worry that constant rule changes make it hard for fans to keep up or enjoy the racing, especially when new tech adds cost and complexity. A few wish the engines sounded like the old days, saying newer hybrid cars are too quiet. Some are excited about sustainable fuels and active aero, hoping this keeps F1 special while helping the environment. Others feel F1 is losing its “raw” feeling and miss the days when design differences were more obvious. Many agree that safety is the best improvement, though some still think the cars are too big and heavy. Finally, there’s debate over whether more electric power will make racing more fun or take away what makes F1 unique.

- 原文链接: [Jules, our asynchronous coding agent](https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/jules-now-available/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44813854)

Google has launched Jules, an AI coding agent, for all users after a public beta test. Jules is powered by Gemini 2.5 and helps developers write and improve code asynchronously, meaning you don’t have to wait for it to finish before doing other things.

During beta, thousands of developers used Jules for many tasks and shared over 140,000 code improvements. Google listened to feedback and improved Jules’s user interface, fixed many bugs, and added new features. Now, Jules can reuse your earlier setups, which lets it finish new tasks more quickly. It also connects with GitHub issues, making it easier to track and solve problems. Jules now supports “multimodal” inputs, so it can use text, images, or other data to help with coding.

Jules creates coding plans using Gemini 2.5 Pro, which should give better code results. There are different access levels: basic use is free, but Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers get much higher limits. Students can get a free year of Pro access. Subscribers will see these updates starting today, and you can try Jules at jules.google.

In the Hacker News comments, some users are excited about having a coding agent that works in the background and can handle tasks while they do other work. A few say the integration with GitHub issues is helpful for real projects. Some developers like the idea of higher limits for power users but worry about paying for features that may not work well yet. Others are concerned about trusting AI with important code, especially in company projects. There are questions about how well Jules works with different programming languages and if it handles large codebases. Some users want to know if it will really save them time or if they still need to check all the AI’s work. A few people like that students get free access, but some wish it was more open for everyone. There are also worries about privacy and Google storing code. Overall, many see potential, but they want to test it for real jobs before fully trusting it.

## Multics

- 原文链接: [Multics](https://www.multicians.org/multics.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44814596)

The article talks about Multics, an old but important operating system that started in 1965 and was used until 2000. Multics was made to let many people share a big computer safely, and it was used in schools, companies, and by the government.

Multics was a research project first, but later became a real product sold by Honeywell. It was one of the first systems to offer secure, remote computing, like a cloud service before the cloud existed. Multics had many new ideas: it was reliable, let many users work at the same time, and had strong security. Some features from Multics are still being added to today’s systems. The system was made by a group called Project MAC at MIT, and many people, called “Multicians,” helped build it. The website about Multics has a lot of history, stories, documents, and even a simulator you can run today. The source code is open, so anyone can study or use it for free. The site also helps keep memories of the people who worked on Multics alive, with stories and pictures. There are lists of all the places where Multics was used, like universities, the military, and big companies. The project’s main goals are to save Multics’ ideas, give credit to its creators, and help people learn from its past. Recent updates include a new version of the Multics simulator and news about people who worked on it.

In the comments, many people praise Multics for being ahead of its time. Some say it was the first real “cloud” computer, letting users log in from far away. Others mention how Multics inspired UNIX, which is still used today. One person explains that UNIX was made as a simpler version of Multics, but with fewer features. Some users think that Multics’ strong security is still better than what we have now. A few share memories of using Multics in school or work, saying it was reliable and powerful. Others talk about the PL/I programming language used in Multics, saying it was hard to learn but very flexible. There are comments about the simulator, with people happy they can still try Multics on modern computers. Some users wish more old systems like Multics were saved and shared online. Still, a few think Multics was too complex, and that simpler systems won in the end. Most agree that Multics taught the world a lot about computers, and its ideas still matter today.
