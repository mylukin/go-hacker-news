## I built Timeframe, our family e-paper dashboard

- 原文链接: [I built Timeframe, our family e-paper dashboard](https://hawksley.org/2026/02/17/timeframe.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47113728)

This article is about Joel building a custom e-paper dashboard called Timeframe for his family’s home. He wanted a way to see calendar, weather, and smart home data without adding bright screens to their living space.

At first, Joel tried building a Magic Mirror with an LCD, but it was too bright and hard to read in sunlight. Next, he hacked some Kindle e-readers as e-paper displays, but these were slow to update and needed a lot of maintenance. He then switched to Visionect e-paper screens, which worked better and lasted for months on one charge. He put different sizes in places like the kitchen, mudroom, and bedroom. The software ran on a Raspberry Pi and used Ruby on Rails to fetch and display data. Friends liked the idea, but the hardware was too expensive—over $1,000 for a big screen—and new fees made it hard to sell as a product.

After a fire destroyed his house, he rebuilt and tried a new large e-paper display from Boox. This one could update in real time and show even more information, like music from Sonos and live weather. He rewrote his backend to be faster and simpler, moving most logic into Home Assistant. This change let him remove a lot of custom code and use Home Assistant for calendar, weather, and sensor data. Now, the dashboard shows only important info, like if a door is open or laundry is done. If the screen is blank, everything in the house is okay.

Joel says the project is not ready for most people yet. The hardware is still expensive, and setting it up is not easy. He wants to make it more reliable and easier to install, and finish moving all data into Home Assistant so it can be shared as an app.

In the comments, people love the idea of an e-paper dashboard and say it looks beautiful and useful. Some wish this kind of device was easier and cheaper to buy. Others share their own projects, like using old Kindles or digital photo frames for similar dashboards. Some comment that e-paper is perfect for home status displays because it uses little power and is not bright at night. A few people ask about privacy and how data is managed, and Joel replies that everything runs locally, not in the cloud. One person points out that the price of large e-paper screens is a big problem, and others agree, hoping costs will drop in the future. A few suggest adding more features, like task lists or integration with different smart home systems, while others warn against making the interface too crowded. Several say they’re inspired to try something like this for their own families.

- 原文链接: [Loops is a federated, open-source TikTok](https://joinloops.org/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47113618)

Loops is a new open-source, federated platform for sharing short videos, similar to TikTok but without ads or corporate control. It aims to let users and creators own their content and make their own rules, while connecting with others across the “fediverse” (a network of independent social platforms).

The main features include vertical video feeds that you can swipe through, two main feeds (“Following” for people you trust, and “For You” for discovery), and no hidden tricks to keep you scrolling. Loops works in your browser or on its mobile app. It uses ActivityPub, the same protocol as Mastodon and Pixelfed, so videos can be seen across different platforms. The camera is simple, lets you switch lenses, add captions, and post quickly. Comments stay with each video and support replies, likes, and mentions. You can like, share, or “boost” videos, and these actions help others discover new creators. Hashtags and search help you find videos and people you care about. Notifications are under your control, so you don’t get bothered by things you don’t want. The project is open-source, values privacy, and wants users to help govern the platform. There are no ads, no data mining, and no tricks to make you addicted.

The people behind Loops say their mission is to give power back to users and creators, not to advertisers or big companies. They want it to be global, ethical, and open to anyone. They ask for donations to keep the project going, since they don’t make money from ads or selling data.

In the Hacker News comments, some people are excited about having a TikTok alternative that is open-source and decentralized. They like the focus on privacy and no ads. Others worry about whether there will be enough interesting content and creators to attract users. Some wonder if federated video sharing will work well, since video files are big and hard to share across many servers. A few people ask about moderation and how Loops will deal with spam or harmful content. There are also questions about how easy it is to run your own server, and if the user interface is as smooth as TikTok’s. Some users point out that open-source social networks often have trouble getting users, since most people go where their friends are. Others are hopeful that Loops can fill a need for people who want more control and less tracking. A few people say they will try it out or share it with friends. Some mention the importance of good discovery tools, so creators can actually get found. There is a lot of interest in how Loops will connect with other fediverse apps, and if this could help smaller creators grow. Overall, the comments show excitement but also questions about real-world use and adoption.

## Global Intelligence Crisis

- 原文链接: [Global Intelligence Crisis](https://www.citriniresearch.com/p/2028gic)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47114579)

This article is about a possible future called the “Global Intelligence Crisis.” It describes what could happen to the world economy if AI keeps getting much better, very quickly.

The story starts in 2026, when companies used AI to do more work with fewer people. Profits grew, stock prices went up, and companies kept investing in AI. But soon, many white-collar workers lost their jobs and had to take lower-paid work. As more people lost jobs, they spent less money, which hurt companies that depended on consumer spending. This created a loop: companies saved money by firing people, spent more on AI, and then fired even more people.

AI also changed how we buy things. Smart AI agents made shopping decisions for people, always looking for the best price. This destroyed the business of many companies that made money from human habits, like travel booking sites or delivery apps. Even things like credit cards were affected, as AIs found ways to avoid fees using new payment tech. The value of “human relationships” in business dropped, because machines don’t care about brand loyalty or habits.

The article explains that this time, job losses are different from before. In the past, new technology killed some jobs but created new ones for humans. With advanced AI, many new jobs go to machines, not people. Most new human jobs pay less. Incomes for white-collar workers fall, so they spend less, which hurts the whole economy. The top earners, who spend the most, are hit hardest.

Big problems also show up in finance. Many business loans and mortgages are based on the idea that workers will keep their jobs and pay their debts. But as good workers lose jobs, defaults start. Even safe-seeming loans become risky. Banks, insurance companies, and investment funds are all connected, so trouble spreads. House prices fall in tech-heavy cities, and more people can’t pay their mortgages.

The government tries to help, but tax income drops as fewer people have good jobs. Usual responses like cutting interest rates don’t work well because the problem isn’t just money—it’s that humans are no longer needed for many jobs. There are ideas for new policies, like giving people money or taxing AI, but politicians argue and act slowly.

In the comments, many people agree that AI could cause huge job losses, but some think the article is too negative. Some say new types of jobs will appear, just like after past tech changes. Others feel this time is different because AI can do nearly any white-collar job. A few think the government should help people with basic income or retraining, while others worry this would cost too much or make people stop working. Some point out that rich tech companies and AI owners will get even richer, making inequality worse. Others debate if AI will really get that good, or if humans will always find new roles. Some suggest that society will have to change its ideas about work and value. There is also worry about social unrest, as people lose hope and protest against tech companies. A few are hopeful, saying humans can adapt if we act soon and make smart policies. But most agree that if things go wrong, the changes could be fast and hard for many people.

## Attention Media ≠ Social Networks

- 原文链接: [Attention Media ≠ Social Networks](https://susam.net/attention-media-vs-social-networks.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47110515)

This article talks about how social networks have changed over time. It explains that early social networks like Twitter or Facebook were about keeping up with friends and people you chose to follow.

The author remembers when notifications were real, like when someone replied to you. At first, these platforms felt hopeful and user-friendly, part of what people called “Web 2.0.” But after 2012, things started to change for the worse. Platforms added the “infinite scroll,” making pages never-ending and harder to step away from. Notifications also became less meaningful. Instead of showing things you cared about, they started showing random updates just to make you click. The author felt like the platforms were tricking users to spend more time looking at things that didn’t matter.

Later, timelines filled up with posts from strangers instead of friends. The author says this felt overwhelming, like standing in front of a loudspeaker. Social networks stopped being about real connections and turned into “attention media.” These new systems were designed to grab and sell your attention with endless, often pointless content. The author decided to leave these platforms because they no longer felt social or meaningful.

However, the author found Mastodon, a newer social platform, and says it reminds them of older, better days. On Mastodon, you only see posts from people you choose to follow, and notifications are real again. There are no tricks to keep you scrolling, and if your friends haven’t posted anything, there’s simply nothing new to see. The author hopes Mastodon and platforms like it can keep this true social feeling.

Many comments agree with the author, saying that big social networks now feel like TV channels, showing you things just to keep you watching, not to help you connect. Some users say that platforms use tricks like infinite scroll and fake notifications to keep people hooked, and it makes them uncomfortable. Others share that they miss the older internet, where things felt more personal and less controlled by algorithms.

A few commenters point out that not everyone had the same great experience in the early days; some say social networks always had problems, just different ones. Some people like Mastodon but feel it is harder to use or find friends compared to big platforms. Others think the move to “attention media” was bound to happen as companies looked for more ways to make money.

A couple of users mention that it’s possible to make social networks better if people support smaller, user-focused platforms. Some warn that even new platforms can change if they become too popular. Overall, the comments show that many readers feel the same frustration as the author, but some are less hopeful that things can go back to how they were.

## Show HN: Local-First Linux MicroVMs for macOS

- 原文链接: [Show HN: Local-First Linux MicroVMs for macOS](https://shuru.run)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47113567)

This article introduces Shuru, a tool for running lightweight Linux virtual machines (VMs) on macOS, made for running AI agents and code safely on your own computer. Shuru uses Apple’s Virtualization framework, so it works fast on Apple Silicon Macs and doesn’t need Docker.

You can start a fresh VM with one command. By default, each VM is “ephemeral,” so nothing you do inside it will last unless you save a “checkpoint.” You can make checkpoints (which are like snapshots or git commits) to save your setup and return to it later. If you want, you can also branch from a checkpoint to try something new.

Networking is off by default for safety, but you can turn it on with a flag. You control how much CPU, RAM, and disk space each VM gets. Port forwarding works too, so you can expose services from the VM to your Mac easily. The command-line interface is simple and lets you run code, install packages, and manage checkpoints.

Some example uses: running AI code in a safe place, letting agents install their own tools, running tests in clean environments, or just quickly spinning up a Linux box for development. You install Shuru with a single command and then run VMs with another.

In the comments, many people are excited about running secure, throwaway environments without Docker. Some like that it uses Apple’s own virtualization tools, which means better performance and simpler setup on new Macs. Others are glad it’s open-source and written in Rust.

A few users ask how it’s different from tools like Lima or Colima. Some say they wish there was support for Windows or Intel Macs. Others note this is perfect for testing code you don’t trust, or for AI agents that might try risky things. Some worry about the safety of running scripts from the internet even in a VM, while others say the default networking-off setting is a smart move.

One commenter points out that “ephemeral by default” is great for reproducibility, since each run starts fresh. Another likes the “checkpoint” feature, saying it’s easier than managing Docker images. Some users ask about performance, and a few would like to see tighter integration with common developer tools. Overall, the tool gets a warm welcome, with many developers keen to try it for safe, fast Linux testing on their Macs.

## Fix your tools

- 原文链接: [Fix your tools](https://ochagavia.nl/blog/fix-your-tools/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47112174)

This article tells a story about debugging a bug in an open source library. The author tried to use a debugger to find the problem, but the debugger did not stop at the set breakpoint.

The author first ignored the debugger problem and tried other ways to find the bug, like adding log statements. These extra steps did not help much and just made things more frustrating. After some time, the author realized the real problem was with the debugger tool itself, not the code. Fixing the debugger was just a simple one-line configuration change. Once the debugger worked, the author could finally see what was happening and fix the original bug quickly. In the end, the main lesson is to fix your broken tools before trying to fix the code. Working tools help you solve problems faster.

In the comments, many readers agree with the main idea. They say it is easy to forget about tool problems when you are focused on fixing code bugs. Some share their own stories where fixing tools saved them time later. Others warn that sometimes fixing tools can take a lot of time, so you should balance how much time you spend. A few people point out that sometimes it's easier to work around a broken tool if you only need to fix one bug quickly. Many programmers say they have learned to check their tools first when things don’t work as expected. One comment mentions that good tools are important for long-term productivity. Another person says writing extra code to work around broken tools is usually a waste of time. Some readers thank the author for the reminder, saying they often forget this simple advice. A few share tips on how to quickly check if a tool is misconfigured. Overall, most people agree: fixing your tools first can save a lot of trouble.

## Six Math Essentials

- 原文链接: [Six Math Essentials](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2026/02/16/six-math-essentials/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47113796)

Terence Tao shared that he is publishing a new book called “Six Math Essentials,” which explains six key ideas in math—numbers, algebra, geometry, probability, analysis, and dynamics. The book will show how these ideas connect to real life, history, and modern math, and is planned for release soon, with preorders open already. Tao says the book is for a general audience, meaning you do not need to be a math expert or have a college degree in math to enjoy it. It is mainly for adults, but older children who like math might also find it interesting. The book will likely be published in several countries, but the dates may vary; for example, the UK and France might get it at the same time, but other countries may have to wait.

Some readers asked for more details about what’s inside the book and if there will be sample pages or chapters to preview. Others were excited and said they hope to read it soon. One reader asked why logic was not included as a math essential, and Tao replied by linking to a discussion with an AI, showing that the topic is still debated. Someone else explained their own view, listing logic as very important and giving a breakdown of how math areas might be organized, starting from logic and set theory, then topology, geometry, algebra, and analysis.

Other readers asked about Tao’s other books and if he will publish more, like a book based on his lecture notes or the “cosmic distance ladder” book. Some people shared their excitement, while one wondered if the book is more about math philosophy. There was also a question about translation and international publishing, with a publisher replying that more information would come closer to the release. In summary, people are looking forward to the book, want more information, and are curious about how Tao chose these six areas. There is also a friendly debate on what is truly “essential” in math, and some readers want to see logic or other topics included. Overall, the comments show a lot of interest from both math fans and general readers.

## Linuxulator on FreeBSD Feels Like Magic

- 原文链接: [Linuxulator on FreeBSD Feels Like Magic](https://hayzam.com/blog/02-linuxulator-is-awesome/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47113527)

This article talks about using Linux software on FreeBSD with a tool called Linuxulator. The writer wanted to use Visual Studio Code on FreeBSD, but there were problems because he needs ARM64 support and a good remote development setup.

He explains that most of his coding happens on devices like OpenWRT or FreeBSD, not on his main laptop. Usual ways to edit code remotely, like NFS or SSHFS, were very slow and caused many issues. Sometimes, it took up to 10 minutes just to open a file. He tried using the VS Code Remote SSH extension, which works well on Linux and macOS, but it is not officially supported on OpenWRT or FreeBSD. Still, he gave it a try on OpenWRT, and it worked right away, which surprised him.

He then tried the same extension on FreeBSD. At first, it showed an error: “Unsupported platform: FreeBSD.” Instead of giving up, he found a guide on GitHub that explained how to use the Linuxulator. Linuxulator is a FreeBSD feature that lets you run Linux programs. The setup was simple: enable Linuxulator, start it, and install a Linux base system. He created a special file to set the right PATH for Linux programs and set up his SSH config to use this file with the BASH_ENV variable. After these changes, his VS Code remote session on FreeBSD worked like magic. All his needed extensions worked, except Rollup, but he fixed that by using a WASM build.

He says that using Linuxulator gave him a smooth, fast experience running Linux programs on FreeBSD. It felt magical and removed a big problem in his daily work. He’s impressed by how stable and reliable this FreeBSD feature is.

Commenters on Hacker News shared many thoughts. Some people praised Linuxulator and said it has helped them run other Linux apps on FreeBSD for years. Others said that setting up Linuxulator can be tricky for beginners, but with good guides, it’s easier now. Several users liked how FreeBSD stays flexible by supporting Linux software, making it a good choice for developers. A few mentioned that there are still some rare bugs or missing features, so it isn’t perfect for every Linux app. Some users warned that while it works well for tools like VS Code, it might not work for more complex things like Docker. Others asked if FreeBSD could get more ARM64 support in the future. There were also tips on making remote development faster, like using rsync or inotify tools. Many agreed that solutions like Linuxulator are good examples of strong engineering and help more people try out FreeBSD.

Org-mode started with Carsten Dominik, and now many people help maintain it. Worg is a special part of the Org-mode website, built by volunteers, sharing tutorials, code, and advice to make Org-mode easier for everyone. 

The article shows how to download Worg files, where to find guides in different languages, and how to get help through FAQs, mailing lists, and chat channels. It gives links to beginner guides, detailed manuals, quick reference cards, and tips for customizing Org-mode. There are resources for advanced users, like programming with Org-mode, using it for blogs, and syncing files with git. Worg also points to third-party tools and extra packages made by the community.

The article encourages people to help out by donating, contributing guides, or joining the Worg team. There are instructions for editing and sharing on Worg, plus ways to meet others in the community, both online and in person.

In the comments, many people praise Org-mode’s power and flexibility. Some say it changed how they work and plan their days. Several mention the steep learning curve, saying Org-mode can be hard for beginners, but Worg helps a lot. A few users share their favorite tricks, like using Org-mode to track habits or write reports. Some wish Org-mode worked outside Emacs, or was easier to set up on mobile. Others talk about the helpful community and how Worg’s guides made a big difference for them. A few people mention they tried Org-mode but found it too complex for simple note-taking. There are debates about plain text versus apps with nicer interfaces. Some users highlight the value of free software and community work in making tools like this last a long time.

## Music Discovery

- 原文链接: [Music Discovery](https://www.secondtrack.co/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47114672)

Second Track is a new website that helps you discover music records you might like. You can search by mood, artist, or tell the site what you love, and it will suggest albums to check out.

The site lets you browse or create collections, called “crates,” each with five records around a theme. You can import your Discogs library, so the site gives you personal recommendations based on your own vinyl collection. There are also “challenges” where people build and share crates for things like “Albums That Changed Your Life” or “Summer Vinyl.” If you want to explore new genres, there are guides with starting points in styles like ambient, jazz, post-rock, and more. The site offers “listening guides” to help you follow music connections from one artist or style to another—like a playlist, but with a story. You can also track record prices and get alerts when they drop. Weekly, the site emails handpicked record suggestions, not just algorithm picks.

In the Hacker News comments, some people liked the idea of using mood or personal taste to find music, saying it feels more human than most algorithm-based services. A few users appreciated the focus on vinyl and real records, not just streaming. Others thought importing from Discogs was a smart feature, since many music fans already use it. Some people wondered how good the AI recommendations are and if they really feel personal or just random. A few users compared it to Bandcamp or Spotify, asking if it offers something new. There were comments about the design, with some loving the clean look and others wanting more features, like deeper search or integration with other music tools. A couple of users hoped the site would recommend more obscure or rare records, not just popular ones. Some worried about the long-term success—can it build a big enough community? But many agreed it’s fun to see more projects that help people discover music in different ways.
