This article is about someone who spent six years building a wooden display with 1,000 pixels that anyone online can control and draw on. The creator wanted to make something big, fun, and very slow compared to modern screens.

He started by testing many types of “pixels”—from ping pong balls to Nerf balls and wooden cubes. Each type had its own problems, like cost, size differences, or being hard to paint or turn. He finally chose wooden cubes and built them all by hand, which took a lot of time. For the grid, he drilled lots of holes in shelves and threaded the cubes on wires to keep them spaced right.

To move and turn the pixels, he used a CNC machine with stepper motors, a Raspberry Pi, and special software. The Raspberry Pi connects to the internet, checks what to draw from a web app, and sends commands to the machine. The machine moves to each pixel and uses a poking stick to turn it. There’s a light sensor to check if the pixel turned correctly.

The web app lets anyone submit or vote on images for the display. There are also modes for real-time drawing and even a slow clock. When a picture is finished, a camera records a timelapse to share online. The whole setup streams live video so people can watch the machine at work.

He added some basic protections against abuse, but mostly wants to see what people do with his project. He hopes people enjoy drawing on it and even invites others to take control in the future.

In the comments, many people are impressed by the amount of work and creativity. Some love the mix of old and new tech: wood and the internet together. Others talk about their own projects and share advice about making things with CNC machines or Raspberry Pi. A few ask technical questions about how the pixels are moved or how the web app works.

Some commenters point out how slow the display is, but most see this as part of its charm. There’s talk about the beauty of “over-engineering” for fun. A few suggest improvements, like using different materials or making the pixels easier to swap. Others wonder about the cost and the patience needed to finish such a long project.

People like that the project is open to everyone, and some say they have already tried drawing on the display. There are also concerns about possible abuse, but most agree it’s good to let people play and learn from what happens. Overall, the project is seen as inspiring, fun, and a bit crazy—in the best way.

## Qwen-Image: Crafting with native text rendering

- 原文链接: [Qwen-Image: Crafting with native text rendering](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen-image/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44787631)

Qwen-Image is a new AI model that can generate and edit images with very good text rendering abilities. The article explains that Qwen-Image can handle both English and Chinese text in images, and it can also edit pictures while keeping them realistic.

The model is strong at drawing clear, complex text, even in difficult layouts like multi-line or paragraph styles. It works well for both alphabetic languages (like English) and logographic ones (like Chinese), keeping the text looking natural and readable. Qwen-Image is not just for writing single words—examples show it can fill posters, signs, book covers, and even long handwritten notes with clear, correct text.

Tests show Qwen-Image beats other models at creating and editing images, especially when text is important. It does better than earlier models on many public tests for both image creation and editing. For example, it can put several different signs in a busy street scene, or create a poster with many text areas and styles. In another example, it writes a poem on a small piece of paper in a picture, with the words still readable. The model can even switch between English and Chinese in the same image, and does well with both short and long texts.

Qwen-Image is also good at making general images in many styles, not just text-heavy pictures. It can draw in anime, photo-realistic, or even traditional Chinese painting styles. For editing, it can add or remove things from a picture, change the style, or move a person’s pose. The team hopes this model will help more people create images and lower the barrier for image editing.

In the comments, some people are very impressed with Qwen-Image’s text rendering, especially for Chinese. They say most image models have trouble with Chinese or long texts, but Qwen-Image does it well. Others mention that the model could be useful for making posters, comics, or product mockups, since it handles different fonts and layouts. A few users worry about possible misuse, like fake news or deepfake images with realistic text.

Some developers ask about the training process and if the data is open. One person is happy that the team shares benchmarks and demos. Others ask for more tests with other languages, like Japanese or Arabic. Some users wonder how Qwen-Image does with very small or fancy fonts, or if it can handle handwriting styles. There are also questions about speed and hardware needs, since the model is large (20B parameters). Finally, a few people are happy to see open models from China and hope for more open research in AI.

## NASA's Curiosity picks up new skills

- 原文链接: [NASA's Curiosity picks up new skills](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/marking-13-years-on-mars-nasas-curiosity-picks-up-new-skills/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44790271)

NASA’s Curiosity rover has been on Mars for 13 years, and engineers have just given it new skills to help it work better. They updated the rover to save energy, let it do more tasks at once, and manage its own naps if it finishes work early.

Curiosity is powered by a special nuclear battery that slowly loses strength over time, so saving energy is important. The rover now combines jobs that used to be done one at a time. For example, Curiosity can now send data to an orbiter while also driving or taking pictures, instead of waiting to do each job separately. This helps it use less power and get more science done each day.

If Curiosity finishes its tasks early, it can now put itself to sleep instead of just waiting, which saves even more energy. Small time savings add up, so the rover will last longer and keep doing science for more years.

The team has also fixed problems as Curiosity gets older. They worked around a broken color filter on one camera, found ways to protect its wheels from damage, and made new software to keep the drill working. Even with some wheel damage, the rover should be able to drive for years.

Curiosity is now exploring a place called Mount Sharp, looking at rock formations created by water long ago. These rocks might show if life could have lived on Mars in the past.

On Hacker News, many readers said they were impressed by how long Curiosity has lasted and how NASA keeps finding ways to fix problems from millions of miles away. Some think it is amazing that software updates can make such a big difference to a robot on another planet. Others talked about the benefits of nuclear power for space robots, saying that solar panels would not last as long with all the dust on Mars.

Some users joked about the rover being like a teenager now, as the article said, learning to multitask and be more independent. A few people wondered if these kinds of energy-saving tricks could be used in other robots or even on Earth. There were also comments about the technical challenges, like how hard it must be to test for every problem that could happen in space.

A handful of users worried about the future, asking what will happen when the power runs out completely, but most agreed that NASA has gotten great value from the mission. Overall, readers were excited to see how Curiosity is still “growing up” after all these years on Mars.

## What Happened When I Tried to Replace Myself with ChatGPT in My English Class

- 原文链接: [What Happened When I Tried to Replace Myself with ChatGPT in My English Class](https://lithub.com/what-happened-when-i-tried-to-replace-myself-with-chatgpt-in-my-english-classroom/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44769547)

The article is about an English teacher who tried to let ChatGPT teach their class instead of doing it themselves. The teacher wanted to see if AI could give students feedback and help them learn to write.

First, the teacher asked students to send their essays to ChatGPT. ChatGPT read the essays and gave comments and suggestions. The AI could point out grammar mistakes and give ideas for better words. It also gave feedback on structure and style. Students liked that the AI gave quick answers and didn’t judge them. Some students used ChatGPT to rewrite their essays many times.

But the teacher found problems. ChatGPT sometimes gave wrong advice. It often missed the deeper meaning of the essays and did not notice creative ideas. The feedback was too general and sometimes boring. ChatGPT could not understand the students’ personal stories or cultural background. Some students stopped thinking for themselves and just followed what the AI said. The teacher noticed the class felt less personal and less human.

In the Hacker News comments, people had mixed views. Some thought using ChatGPT was a good way to save time and help students improve fast. Others worried that students would stop learning to think on their own. Many said AI feedback is okay for fixing grammar but not for real writing skills. Some teachers in the comments tried AI too and agreed it can help, but only with a teacher’s guidance. A few people warned that students might cheat or just copy the AI. Others hoped AI would get better and help more in the future. Several said that writing is about sharing ideas and feelings, so humans are still needed. One commenter pointed out that AI can help shy students who are scared to ask questions. Another person said the teacher’s job is not just to mark essays, but to inspire and connect. Most agreed that AI is a tool, not a replacement for a real teacher.

## How we made JSON.stringify more than twice as fast

- 原文链接: [How we made JSON.stringify more than twice as fast](https://v8.dev/blog/json-stringify)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44786005)

This article explains how the V8 JavaScript engine team made JSON.stringify more than twice as fast. JSON.stringify is used to turn JavaScript objects into JSON strings, which is important for things like sending data over the internet or saving data in browsers.

The big change is a new “fast path” that works when the object to serialize is simple and has no side effects (like running code or special tricks while turning into a string). If the object is plain and safe, V8 can skip a lot of safety checks, making it much faster. The new fast path is also iterative, not recursive, so it can handle deeply nested objects without worrying about stack overflows.

Strings are now handled better too. V8 checks if a string uses regular one-byte characters (like normal text) or two-byte characters (like emojis or some foreign letters). It has two special versions of the stringifier for these cases, which makes checks faster and uses less memory. If a string with special characters is found, V8 can switch to the slower path, but most strings stay fast.

For serializing strings, V8 uses SIMD hardware instructions for long strings, letting it check many characters at once for special symbols that need escaping. For short strings, it uses clever tricks with regular computer instructions. Most of the time, if there are no special characters, the string is copied quickly.

Another speedup is an “express lane” for objects with the same hidden class (an internal V8 thing for objects with the same shape). If these objects are plain and safe, V8 can copy their keys even faster. The team also improved how numbers are turned into strings, replacing the old Grisu3 method with Dragonbox, which is faster everywhere in V8.

Memory use is improved by breaking up the output buffer into segments, not one big piece, so it doesn’t need to copy everything when more space is needed. All these changes only work for simple objects: no replacer or space arguments, no custom toJSON methods, no weird indexed properties, and no complex string types. For most real-world uses, these limits are fine, so most code gets faster automatically.

In the comments, many developers are excited about these speedups and thank the V8 team for their hard work. Some people ask about edge cases, like what happens with custom toJSON or replacers, and note that those still use the slower path. Others are curious if similar tricks could help other JavaScript engines, or if Node.js will get these improvements soon.

A few users ask about the safety and correctness of the new fast path, and the V8 team replies that correctness always comes first—if any risk is found, it falls back to the old way. Some commenters point out that the new method won’t help if you use pretty-printing or non-standard objects, but agree that most web apps just serialize plain data.

One person wonders if there is a way for developers to know if their data will use the fast path. Others discuss the Dragonbox number conversion and are happy it helps more than just JSON.stringify. Some users share their own hacks to speed up JSON serialization in the past, but say this update is much better and easier.

Overall, the community sees this as a big step forward for JavaScript performance, with most people happy their code will get faster “for free.” Some want even more details about the implementation, and a few ask about benchmarks in other browsers. Many agree that making core web features faster is always a win.

## Indian Sign Painting: A typeface designer's take on the craft

- 原文链接: [Indian Sign Painting: A typeface designer's take on the craft](https://bl.ag/indian-sign-painting-a-typeface-designers-take-on-the-craft/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44767727)

This article looks at Indian sign painting through the eyes of Pooja Saxena, a typeface designer who has been documenting street lettering since 2013. She challenges the common idea that Indian signs are only colorful and flamboyant, saying there are many styles and methods used across the country.

Pooja started the India Street Lettering project to collect photos and stories about signs from many cities. She found that sign painters often use metal, mosaic, or wood, and each area has its own look. Instead of focusing on big trends, she pays attention to small details in neighborhoods. She learned sign painters often get full trust from shop owners, designing signs in their own style without much discussion. This creative freedom lets local styles grow, like the unique painted buses in Kolkata or the careful color choices of band trolleys in Lucknow.

Pooja also notices how some sign painters copy the look of printed type, even when it’s not needed, because they follow old habits from movable type printing. But many painters use the freedom of hand painting to play with shapes, lines, and how scripts mix together. For example, they might shrink vowel marks to fit small spaces, or blend several languages in one sign, like Latin, Devanagari, and Nastaliq on a shopfront. These signs reflect local tastes, not just global or digital trends.

She says looking at sign painting as a type designer helps her see both the skill and the unique choices painters make, sometimes bringing new ideas to typeface design. Her project has become an online archive and will soon be a book, showing how rich and varied Indian street lettering is.

In the Hacker News comments, some readers love seeing local crafts like sign painting celebrated, saying they give cities real character. Others are surprised at how much trust shop owners give painters, and think this leads to more creative work. A few point out that digital tools often struggle with mixing scripts, but hand painters do it well and with style. One user worries that vinyl and printed signs are replacing this art, making streets look the same everywhere. Another commenter shares memories of seeing similar signs as a child, and says it’s great to see them valued today.

Some discuss the technical points, like how habits from printing still shape how painters draw letters. There are also comments about the skill needed to paint signs by hand, and respect for the painters’ ability to match different scripts. A few suggest ways technology could help the craft survive, while others think keeping it human is what makes it special. Many agree that projects like Pooja’s help save and share this unique part of street life.

## Content-Aware Spaced Repetition

- 原文链接: [Content-Aware Spaced Repetition](https://www.giacomoran.com/blog/content-aware-sr/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44790422)

This article talks about a new way to improve spaced repetition systems (SRS) by making them aware of what each flashcard is about. Right now, SRS like Anki treat every card as separate, even if they are about the same topic or idea.

The author explains that all SRS use two main parts: schedulers and memory models. The scheduler decides which cards you see each day, while the memory model guesses how likely you are to remember each card. Most systems only use your review history for a single card and do not understand the meaning or connection between cards. This can be a problem if cards are related, because remembering one can help you remember the others, but the system does not notice this.

The article introduces “content-aware” memory models. These models look at the actual text and meaning of cards. They can find related cards and use their review histories to make better guesses about what you remember. For example, if you remember “Rome is the capital of Italy,” you probably also remember “Italy’s capital is Rome.” Some new systems, like KARL, use AI tools to find similar cards and improve scheduling. The author did some small tests and found that using information from related cards did help the system work better.

Another example comes from MathAcademy, which uses a tree of math concepts. If you practice a hard topic, the system knows it also helps you remember easier, related topics.

The author also discusses practical problems with current SRS, such as needing unique IDs for every card. With content-aware models, the system could use the text and meaning to track your learning, making it easier to edit or move cards without breaking your review history. This could also help create new learning tools, like AI tutors that talk with you and ask different questions each time.

A big challenge is getting enough good data. Most SRS data does not include the actual card text, and students learn outside the system too. There are also issues with bias, since the way reviews are scheduled affects what data the system collects. Open datasets that include real card content and honest review histories would help make better models.

In the Hacker News comments, some people are excited about the idea of content-aware SRS, saying it could make learning smoother and more natural. Others point out that AI models might make mistakes in finding the right connections between cards, or that more complex systems could be harder for users to understand and trust. Some users worry about privacy when sharing review data with AI tools, and others mention that making the system too smart might take away useful “friction” that helps with memory.

A few commenters share their own experiences with SRS, saying they often make cards that are too similar or have trouble when editing cards. They like the idea of the system handling changes more easily. Some people ask about the technical side, like how fast new models can run on personal devices or if they need to send data to the cloud. Others debate whether spaced repetition is already “good enough” and whether these changes are worth the extra effort.

There are also comments about the importance of good card design, and whether smarter systems might encourage people to be lazy when making cards. Some think content-aware SRS could help with more advanced learning, like conversations and open-ended questions, while others wonder if it’s best to keep systems simple and focused. A few users hope for open-source tools and datasets so more people can experiment and improve these models.

## Once a death sentence, cardiac amyloidosis is finally treatable

- 原文链接: [Once a death sentence, cardiac amyloidosis is finally treatable](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/04/well/cardiac-amyloidosis.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44790944)

The article talks about a disease called cardiac amyloidosis, which was once deadly but now has new treatments. Cardiac amyloidosis happens when a protein called amyloid builds up in the heart, making it hard for the heart to pump blood.

For many years, doctors could not do much to help people with this illness. Most patients died within a few years of getting sick. Diagnosis was also very hard, because the symptoms look like other heart problems. Some signs include tiredness, swelling in the legs, and shortness of breath. Many doctors missed the disease until it was too late. Older men, especially, are at higher risk.

Now, new drugs are changing everything. Some medicines can stop the amyloid protein from building up. Others can help remove the protein from the heart. People who get these medicines early can live much longer and feel better. One example is tafamidis, which slows the growth of amyloid. Researchers are also working on gene therapies to stop the disease before it starts.

Doctors are learning to spot the disease sooner. They use blood tests, heart scans, and sometimes even a heart biopsy. Early treatment is very important, so catching the disease quickly can save lives. Hospitals are also teaching more doctors about this illness, so fewer cases are missed. Patients who used to have no hope now have a chance for a normal life.

In the Hacker News comments, many people are surprised that this disease was so hard to detect for so long. Some say it shows how medicine can miss rare illnesses if doctors are not trained to look for them. Others talk about the high price of new drugs like tafamidis, which costs a lot of money, and worry about who can afford treatment. A few users mention that new genetic and protein-based treatments are exciting, but may take years to reach everyone.

Some readers share stories of friends or family who had strange heart problems and wonder if they had this disease. Others praise advances in medical science, saying they give hope to people with rare diseases. There are also comments about the need for better health care so more people can get tested and treated early. A few warn that while the new drugs are helpful, they do not cure the disease completely, so research must continue. Finally, some users remind everyone that public awareness matters, so people know the signs and can ask their doctor for help.

## OpenIPC: Open IP Camera Firmware

- 原文链接: [OpenIPC: Open IP Camera Firmware](https://openipc.org/à)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44758463)

OpenIPC is an open source firmware that you can install on your IP cameras to replace the original software from the camera maker. It’s made for cameras with ARM and MIPS processors, and the goal is to give users more control and security.

The firmware comes as pre-compiled files, so it’s easy for most people to install. If you like to code, you can also download the full source code and make changes or improvements. OpenIPC uses the MIT License, which means you can use it for almost anything—even in closed, paid software—but the team asks you to share your changes and contact them if you make money from it. The project does not allow any military use.

OpenIPC is built using Buildroot, which helps make a custom Linux system for the cameras. For video streaming, it can use different tools like Majestic, Divinus, Mini, or Venc. Most of these are open source, but Majestic is still closed for now; the developer wants to make it open if he gets enough funding.

With OpenIPC, users get full control over their camera, with no hidden backdoors or malware. It supports streaming to cloud storage, YouTube, and Telegram, and can use proxies or create a virtual tunnel. There are also special projects for cameras on drones, helmets, in medical research, and underwater uses.

Commenters on Hacker News had mixed thoughts. Some users liked the idea of open firmware, especially for better privacy and control. Others were worried about how easy it is to “brick” a camera if the firmware update fails. A few wondered if OpenIPC can support all camera features, since every camera has different hardware. Some people pointed out that using open firmware can help avoid security problems and botnets that often attack old camera software.

Other users said that having the source code is good, but many people just want something that works out of the box. There were also questions about long-term support and updates—some wondered if the community could keep up with new camera models. A few shared stories about using OpenIPC on cheap cameras to add features or fix bugs, while others mentioned the risk that some camera companies may try to block open firmware. Some thought the MIT license was a smart choice, while a few worried that not all code (like Majestic) is fully open yet. Overall, many agreed that projects like OpenIPC are important for making devices more secure and user-friendly.
