Hello everyone, this is the 2025-07-29 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we bring you the latest stories from the tech world, covering outages, open source projects, hardware adventures, and more. Let’s get started.

First, we look at a major outage at Webflow, the well-known website builder. Webflow has been down or unstable for more than 31 hours. The trouble started with slow loading and got worse, blocking users from signing up, using the dashboard, or sending forms. The Webflow team posted updates often. They worked with their database provider, changed infrastructure, and tried to fix the backend where most problems happened. To control the system load, they even stopped new user signups. After some early fixes, service improved a bit, but many users still could not get full access. The team promised hourly updates and thanked everyone for their patience.

On Hacker News, the reaction was strong. Many were shocked that such a big service could be down so long. Some said this shows the risk of depending on one platform for your website or business. Others felt bad for the Webflow team, noting how tough it is to fix large outages. Some guessed there might be a deep technical problem, like a database or cloud issue that is hard to solve. A few said the outage might push people to try other site builders or even simple HTML pages. Many reminded others to always keep backups and have a plan in case your main tool goes offline. Developers shared their own stories about outages and the stress they bring. Some questioned if Webflow’s communication was clear enough, but others found the updates honest and helpful. One user said this is why they prefer open-source tools they can control. In general, people agreed that long outages hurt trust in web platforms, but many also showed understanding for the team working hard to fix things.

Next, we introduce Maru OS, a new operating system for phones. Maru lets you use your Android phone as both a phone and a desktop computer. When you connect your phone to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse, it quickly starts a real Debian Linux desktop. Maru is lightweight, with no extra apps, so your phone stays fast and has more storage. It is built on Android Oreo, and when you unplug from the monitor, the desktop session keeps running in the background. Files and apps are shared between the phone and desktop, and you can use WiFi or mobile data on both sides. Maru is easy to customize and aims to be a real development machine or even run servers.

People in the comments like the idea, saying it could replace laptops for some users. Some remember old projects like Ubuntu Touch and hope Maru will last longer. Others say today’s phones are powerful enough for most desktop tasks. Some point out hardware support could be a problem, since Maru only works on some phones. There are questions about running heavy apps, battery life, and if Maru could work with tablets. Users want to know if it can run normal Linux software, and some suggest adding more features or better security. Many are excited and hopeful, interested in trying Maru OS.

Now, let’s talk about Hyprnote, a new open-source tool that uses AI to take notes during meetings. Hyprnote listens to your online meetings and writes down what is said. It uses speech-to-text, then AI to make short summaries and action items. You can use Hyprnote with Zoom or Google Meet, and because it is open-source, anyone can check the code or run it on their own computer to keep meeting data private. Hyprnote sends notes to Slack or Google Docs, and is free to use and change.

In the comments, people are happy to see an open-source, private option for meeting notes. Some ask how well it works with different accents or noisy audio. Others say setup might be hard for non-technical users. There are questions about which AI models it uses, if it can run offline, and how much it costs to use AI on your own server. Some suggest supporting more languages. People share similar tools but agree that open-source is important for trust. One person points out the need for safe data storage, another asks about use in big companies. Overall, people are hopeful but want to see more real-world tests.

Next, we remember Shunsaku Tamiya, the former president of Tamiya Inc., who has died at age 90. Tamiya helped make plastic model kits famous around the world. He turned his family’s old business into a top company making cars, planes, and radio-controlled toys. After a fire, the company changed from wood to plastic models, or “puramo” in Japan. Tamiya cared deeply about quality and detail. For example, his team visited the Porsche factory many times just to make sure their model of the 934 Turbo was perfect, even buying a real Porsche 911 to check the details.

Tamiya’s company became famous for high-quality, easy-to-build kits, inspiring people to learn about cars and models. In 2018, he won a big award in Japan for his work. Many people, young and old, have enjoyed building Tamiya models over the years.

In the comments, people praise Tamiya’s quality, reliability, and iconic models like The Hornet. Some share memories of building Tamiya kits as children, saying it taught them about cars and patience. Others remember Tamiya kits as more expensive, but always better. Some mention their first Tamiya kit was not a car, showing the wide range of models. People note there are not many company leaders like Tamiya left, and thank him for the fun and inspiration his models gave.

Now for a story about learning electronics. Someone missed seeing real fireflies, so they decided to build their own blinking “fireflies” with basic electronics. The writer started with little knowledge and learned step by step, using help from AI and YouTube. They built an “Astable Multivibrator” circuit to blink an LED, and added a light sensor so it only blinked in the dark, like a real firefly. They learned to change the blinking speed by adjusting resistors and capacitors, and used a potentiometer to fine-tune it. They built web tools to predict blink speed and battery life, finding the firefly could last about 8 months on a battery.

There were problems, like bad wires and soldering smoke, but the writer fixed each one, even making a homemade fume extractor. In the end, they built five fireflies and found joy in seeing them blink in the dark.

Hacker News commenters found the story inspiring, sharing their own memories of learning electronics as kids. Many say hands-on projects are the best way to learn. Some give tips about using 555 timer chips or solar panels. Safety with soldering fumes was discussed, as well as the pros and cons of simulators versus real testing. Many agree that getting stuck and fixing mistakes is a key part of learning, and liked how the project brought back the joy of building something small and personal.

Next, we have a job posting: CodeCrafters is looking for their first marketing hire. CodeCrafters runs a programming challenge platform for software engineers and is backed by Y Combinator. Customers include big tech companies like Google and GitHub. The job includes managing marketing, social media, and blog posts. The company is open to remote workers and new graduates, and offers a salary from $36K to $96K, plus equity. The process includes an intro call, take-home assignment, and interviews with the CEO and CTO.

In the comments, people like the remote and open hiring, but some think the pay could be higher for the skills needed. Some are glad the company wants “real” writing, not just buzzwords. Others warn that being the only marketing person could be stressful. People say small startups let you learn fast and have a big impact. Some wonder if a non-engineer could do the job and what the company culture is like. There are questions about the application process, with some thinking the take-home assignment may be too long. Overall, commenters are interested and think the job could be good for someone who likes startups and wants to grow quickly.

Now, let’s talk about FoundationDB, a database system that started as a small project and was later bought by Apple. The podcast hosts discuss how FoundationDB used “deterministic simulation” testing to make their database reliable. The system supports ACID transactions for safe, consistent data. The founders even built a demo with plywood and lightbulbs to show how it handled failures, which helped build trust.

Deterministic simulation let the team find and fix problems before they happened in the real world. As FoundationDB improved, it became the backend for big companies like Snowflake, DeepSeek, and Apple. The podcast ends by talking about FoundationDB’s legacy and its open-source future.

In the comments, people are amazed by what FoundationDB achieved with a small team. Many say deterministic simulation is rare and wonder why more companies do not use it. Some share their own experiences with FoundationDB and praise its stability. Others ask why Apple does not talk about it more. Some think open-sourcing FoundationDB was a great move. There are calls for deeper dives on technical topics, and many agree the story shows the value of strong testing for all software. There are also comments about the risks of being bought by a big company. Overall, FoundationDB is seen as a great example of smart engineering, good testing, and strong storytelling.

Next, a LibreOffice developer had their Microsoft account banned suddenly, with no warning or reason given. The developer used the account to test things like OneDrive and Office connections for LibreOffice. After the ban, the developer lost access to emails and files, and Microsoft said the decision was final, with no explanation. The developer warns that anyone can lose their account without reason and says this is a risk for people who depend on Microsoft accounts. They want Microsoft to be more open and fair, to explain bans and let people fix problems.

In the comments, some say this is why they avoid cloud services from big companies. Others agree and warn about depending on accounts you do not control. Some defend Microsoft, saying mistakes happen and companies must protect their systems. People share their own stories of losing accounts without warning. Most say companies should explain bans and give users a chance to fix things. Some suggest using open or self-hosted tools instead of big company platforms. A few worry this could happen to anyone, not just developers. Overall, most people think Microsoft should be more open and fair with users.

Now, a story about using XMPP with Snikket for all calls and chats with a partner for a month, after switching from Matrix. Matrix worked well for messages, but had problems with audio and video calls. After moving to XMPP with Prosody, messages were reliable, but notifications on iPhone did not work well. After installing Snikket, calls and messages worked well, with only two times needing to use normal phone calls because of bad network. Voice and video calls worked even during long calls or switching between Wi-Fi and mobile data. Messages and photos also worked well. The author likes having their own server and keeping messages private and encrypted.

In the comments, people praise XMPP for being open and decentralized. Some say XMPP can be hard for non-technical users, but Snikket makes it easier. Others mention that XMPP used to have problems with group chats and media, but these have improved. Some are surprised that notification problems still happen, especially on iPhones, and suggest mobile support is still a weak point. Others compare XMPP to Signal, WhatsApp, and Matrix, saying each has pros and cons. Some enjoy running their own servers and having control over their data, but worry about setup for family members. There are also comments about security, encryption, and tips for improving notifications. Overall, people are glad to see XMPP working well, but agree it still needs to get easier for regular users.

That’s all for today’s episode. Thank you for listening to Hacker News Daily Podcast. We’ll see you next time.
