Hello everyone, this is the 2026-02-24 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have a full lineup of technology stories and community highlights from around the world.

First, let’s look at a major move by Apple. Apple announced that Mac mini production will shift to a new factory in Houston, Texas later this year. This site will also build advanced AI servers and host a new 20,000-square-foot training center for modern manufacturing skills. Apple says the Houston campus will double in size and create thousands of jobs. Workers there will make Mac minis and assemble servers, including building logic boards on site. These servers are important for Apple’s U.S. data centers. Apple explains the Mac mini is key for many users, from students to business owners, and this move shows their commitment to making more products in America.

The new training center will teach students, suppliers, and other U.S. businesses about advanced manufacturing, with Apple experts leading the classes. Apple also shared updates about its wider investments, saying it bought over 20 billion dollars’ worth of U.S.-made chips in the last year, working with partners like TSMC and Texas Instruments. New factories in Texas, Arizona, and Kentucky are producing silicon wafers and glass for Apple devices. The company is also working to train more U.S. manufacturers, both in Detroit and online, especially in AI and automation.

On Hacker News, some people are happy to see Apple bringing jobs and skills back to the U.S. Others wonder if this is more about public relations or government pressure. There are questions about whether all Mac mini parts, like chips, will really be made in the U.S. or just assembled here. Some point out that U.S. production may raise costs, making the Mac mini more expensive, while others say local manufacturing is good for national security, especially for servers. People also talk about how global the supply chain still is, even if final assembly is in the U.S. Some worry about having enough skilled workers, but welcome Apple’s training center. Many see this as a small but important step for U.S. manufacturing, though some doubt it will change the bigger trend of making electronics overseas. Overall, there’s both hope and skepticism from the community.

Next, there’s a big change in the world of academic publishing. A recent article shows a sharp rise in the number of new physics papers on arXiv, especially in high-energy physics theory (hep-th). The writer believes this is because AI can now write papers as well as, or better than, many humans in this field. The data tells the story: December paper counts rose from 634 in 2022 to 1,192 in 2025, and the early months of 2026 look even higher. The author jokes that maybe an AI could do a better job of studying this trend, or even moderating the comments, since it’s now hard to tell if a comment comes from a person or an AI.

In the comments, people agree that AI is changing academic publishing. Many worry it will be harder to find real, quality research among so many low-quality, AI-generated papers. Others say there have always been too many bad papers, and AI just makes it more visible. Some ask if arXiv will start blocking or labeling AI papers, but many say it’s hard to tell who wrote a paper. One person says more papers do not always mean more progress, while another thinks AI could help more people publish ideas. Some are hopeful new tools will help scientists find the best work, while others worry trust in science may fall if there is too much fake or careless work. A few say that only important ideas will last, no matter who writes them. Some even wonder if AI will ever make real discoveries. And, as always, a few joke that soon only AI will be reading these papers.

Now, a lighter story: a software engineer lost his job and decided to teach his small dog, Momo, to “vibe code” video games using AI. He set up a system where Momo presses keys on a keyboard, and those random keystrokes go through a Raspberry Pi to Claude Code, an AI told to treat them as secret commands from a genius game designer. The system uses a Rust app called DogKeyboard to filter the input, and a smart feeder gives Momo treats when she types enough. The games are made in Godot using C#, and the AI is prompted to turn even nonsense input into game ideas and code. Over time, the author added rules to make sure every game has things like sound, a player character, and controls. To help Claude test and fix its own games, the author built tools like screenshot scripts and code linters. Training Momo took a couple of weeks, using treats and chimes.

Some of the games Momo “made” are real and playable, like a rhythm game with an octopus and a sheep herding game. The author found that the real key was not the input, but the feedback tools and systems around the AI. The better the feedback, the better the games. All the tools are open source, and the author encourages others to try. On Hacker News, many found the project funny and creative, praising the mix of humor and engineering. Some pointed out the AI does all the work, but liked the playful idea. Others wondered about trying this with other animals or just random input. There was also talk about the future of AI-assisted coding, with many saying feedback quality is more important than perfect input. Some joked about their own pets becoming programmers, and a few discussed the ethics of using animals, though most agreed Momo seemed happy.

Moving on, another story shows how someone turned an old Kindle into a live display for bus arrival times. The writer jailbroke the Kindle, installed custom software, and set up SSH access. A server gathers bus data from NJ Transit, creates an image of the schedule, and sends it to the Kindle. A custom app lets the user start or stop the dashboard easily. The display shows bus times, date, battery, and wifi status, and listens for a button to exit. Two main problems: sometimes the screen shows leftover marks after days of use, and the battery lasts about five days. The writer hopes to fix these by flashing the screen at night and turning off the device to save power.

In the comments, people praised the project and the idea of reusing old devices. Some said it’s a clever and practical way to give Kindles new life. Others mentioned the challenges of jailbreaking and setting up custom software. There were tips about saving battery and ideas for using the Kindle to show weather or calendars. Some discussed the limits of e-ink screens and the best update speed. Many shared their own Kindle hacks, and most agreed the project is inspiring, though it takes patience and technical skill.

Next up, there’s a privacy tool for Android called “Nearby Glasses.” This app detects smart glasses with cameras near you by scanning for Bluetooth Low Energy signals from brands like Meta, Snap, or Luxottica. The app checks signal strength to see how close the device is and warns you with a notification. Settings let you choose which makers to watch for and how often to get alerts. All data stays on your phone, and the app is open source.

The creator made the app because they worry about hidden cameras and facial recognition in public. In the comments, some call the app a good idea for privacy and like that it’s open source. Others say it’s hard to tell smart glasses from other devices, so there are many false alarms. Some suggest better filtering, or using more data for accuracy. A few point out that smart glasses are still rare, but agree it’s better to have some warning than none. Others ask about an iOS version, or worry phone makers could block apps like this in the future. People also talk about the balance between privacy, security, and not making people scared. Overall, interest is high, but there are both technical and social challenges.

Now, let’s talk about Emdash, an open-source tool for running many AI coding agents in parallel. Emdash works on all major operating systems and supports over 20 agents, like Claude, Copilot, and Codex. Each agent runs in its own Git workspace, so projects stay organized and safe. Emdash connects to project management tools, and you can give tickets to an agent and review changes side by side. It works locally and with remote servers, keeping your code private unless you choose to send it to an AI provider. Telemetry is optional, and adding new agents is simple.

On Hacker News, people are excited about running many agents in parallel and the open-source approach. Some ask about adding new agents or using their favorite tools. There are privacy questions, but users like that data stays local. Some compare Emdash to IDEs like VS Code and discuss if it could replace them. Others find the remote support helpful, and some worry about installing many agent CLIs, but most see the flexibility as a plus. There’s talk about security risks with agent code, but separate Git worktrees help. Most agree Emdash is a good step for coding with AI agents and like the wide range of integrations.

Next, Hugging Face released “Skills,” a collection of open-source tasks for AI and machine learning agents. Skills are folders with scripts and instructions for things like model training, dataset creation, and evaluation. They work with many agent tools, including Claude, Codex, Gemini, and Cursor, using a common format. Installing a Skill depends on your agent, but usually just takes a simple command. Example Skills let you run CLI commands, manage datasets, train or evaluate models, publish research, or track experiments. You can also create and share your own Skills by copying a folder and updating the scripts and description.

In the comments, users like that Hugging Face is helping to standardize agent instructions. Some are excited to create and share new Skills, and see automation potential for ML workflows. There are questions about versioning, Skill quality, and security, with calls for better reviews and sandboxes. Some wish for more documentation and ready-to-use Skills. There’s debate on whether this standard will spread beyond Hugging Face, but most see it as a positive early step.

Now, a story from the past: a man remembers building a model roller coaster with four loops when he was ten years old in 1978 and sending his idea to Disneyland. He loved Space Mountain and dreamed of a ride that went upside down. He built a model, took Polaroid photos, and wrote a letter to Disneyland. Weeks later, he got a reply from Disney’s design team, saying they were working on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad and that his model looked exciting. He felt proud and inspired, not sad or rejected. Years later, he tried inventing other things, and even when turned down, the letter gave him confidence to keep going. The story’s lesson is to keep creating and not let rejection stop you.

In the comments, many people say the story is heartwarming and inspiring. Some share stories of sending ideas to big companies as kids and getting kind replies. Others talk about the importance of encouraging children’s creativity. There are stories about the early days of loop coasters and how fast theme parks changed in the 1970s and 80s. Many say even a simple reply from a company can build a child’s confidence. Some wish companies would answer more letters from kids today, and a few wonder if Disney ever used ideas from letters like this. The main feeling is that small moments can shape a person’s life.

Next, the Manjaro Linux website went offline because its security certificate expired. This has happened before, in 2015 and 2022. The HTTPS certificate is needed for safe and private user connections, and usually renews automatically. But sometimes technical issues or mistakes cause it to lapse, and browsers block the site. This can be frustrating for users who need updates or information from open-source projects. The article points out that better monitoring or alert systems could help catch problems before they cause outages.

In the comments, some say letting certificates expire is a small but embarrassing mistake for a tech group. Others understand that small teams can miss renewal emails or have broken scripts. Some share their own stories of sites going down for the same reason. There’s talk about the importance of HTTPS today and how valid certificates build user trust. A few say outages like this are annoying but better than a security breach. Some ask if open-source projects should get more help to avoid these problems. Others joke, “at least it wasn’t DNS this time,” showing that web issues are common and sometimes funny for those who work with them.

Finally, Cloudflare rebuilt the popular Next.js framework using AI in just one week, creating a new tool called vinext. Vinext is a drop-in replacement for Next.js, built on top of Vite, and can deploy apps to Cloudflare Workers faster and with smaller client bundles. Next.js is hard to deploy to different serverless platforms because of its custom build output, but vinext makes things simpler. Most of your existing code and configs work the same with vinext. It offers faster builds, smaller bundles, and simple deployment, plus advanced caching that only pre-renders pages people actually visit. The big surprise is that almost all the vinext code was written by an AI model, with one engineer guiding, fixing, and checking the results. Tests ensure quality, and the team says they have 94% coverage of the Next.js API.

In the comments, people are amazed by the speed and wonder about code quality and maintainability. Some worry about hidden bugs or how well vinext will handle big production loads. Others like using Vite as a base and see this as proof that AI can speed up software development. There are questions about whether this approach would work for less-documented projects. Many are excited about traffic-aware pre-rendering, saying it solves a real pain point. Some discuss how vinext could help deploy React apps to more platforms, not just Vercel. Most are impressed but plan to wait and see how vinext performs at large scale before switching.
