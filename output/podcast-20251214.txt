Hello everyone, this is the 2025-12-14 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have several stories to share with you, from the early days of social music websites to the risks of npm malware, new tools for learning, and thoughts on how we use computers. Let’s get started.

First, let’s talk about Last.fm and Audioscrobbler. Back in 2002, before Facebook and MySpace were popular, these two UK student projects helped start the social web. They used “collaborative filtering” to suggest new music and connect users with similar listening habits. With Last.fm, you could build a music profile, share it, and get recommendations by comparing your taste with others. They even showed a “Map of Music” to visualize connections between songs and genres. Audioscrobbler, started by another student, tracked what songs you played and built a profile for you. This was called “scrobbling.” Later, Audioscrobbler joined with Last.fm.

Both projects wanted to move away from the old radio model, where DJs picked the songs. Instead, users could start with favorites or a friend’s playlist, and the system would learn and suggest new music over time. One big challenge was music licensing. At first, Last.fm could only play 30-second samples unless you owned the track, but later they paid for licenses to play full songs and became a real online radio.

In the comments, many people remembered how exciting Last.fm was for discovering music and making new friends through shared playlists. Users liked the mix of personal choice and smart recommendations. Some discussed how collaborative filtering was also used by Amazon. There were talks about legal challenges and how hard it was to get music licenses back then. Some missed the early days of Last.fm and wished modern music apps had more social features.

Next, we have a new app called Hashcards. It’s for spaced repetition, like Anki or Mochi, but stores your flashcards as plain Markdown text files in folders. Each deck is a Markdown file—you write your questions, answers, or cloze deletions with simple text. To study, you just run a command and review cards in your web browser; your review history is saved locally.

The main idea is to make card creation and editing easy with any text editor. You can keep your flashcards in a Git repo, track changes, share with others, and use scripts to update or generate cards. Hashcards uses FSRS, a modern scheduling algorithm, to help you learn faster with less review.

The author explains why they built Hashcards instead of using Anki or Mochi. Anki is powerful but has a hard-to-use interface, and the editor is slow. Plugins often break. Mochi looks good and uses Markdown, but making cloze deletions is more work, and its old scheduling was weak. Hashcards is focused on smooth, fast editing, and the plain text format makes cards easy to control and share.

In the comments, many users liked the idea of plain-text flashcards for transparency and control. Some praised using Git for tracking and sharing. Others wondered if most people want this much manual control or if it’s only for technical users. Some wish for mobile support or syncing. There are concerns about losing advanced features from Anki, like media and stats, but others say those are not important for everyone. Many agree that making card creation easy is the key, and the community sees Hashcards as a nice option for people who value simple, open workflows.

Now, let’s move to the monthly “What are you working on?” thread. This is where developers, makers, and founders share their current projects—apps, websites, open source tools, sometimes hardware. Some build for fun, others hope to solve real problems or earn some money. People often mention their tech stack, like Python, JavaScript, or Rust, and ask for feedback or early users. There are stories about small wins, like the first paying customer, and lessons learned, such as marketing being hard or building in public bringing motivation.

In the comments, readers are excited by the many creative ideas and the variety. Some ask for more details or advice, such as focusing on user feedback or keeping things simple. The thread inspires others to start their own side projects. There’s talk about how sharing progress helps with motivation, and some note that the community is very supportive. A few ask about teaming up or want to see follow-ups from past months. Trends like AI tools and remote work apps come up, with many thanking the community for sharing and supporting each other.

Next, an article looks at special fonts made for people with dyslexia, such as OpenDyslexic and Dyslexie. Many believe these fonts help by changing the shape and weight of letters. However, research shows dyslexia is not a vision problem but a language-based difference. Studies say these fonts do not help people with dyslexia read faster or more accurately. In fact, many children with dyslexia prefer normal fonts like Arial or Times New Roman.

Experts warn that promising too much from these fonts can disappoint students. The British Dyslexia Association says clear fonts are good for everyone, but special fonts are not needed. The real help comes from special teaching methods, like phonics and repeated practice, and from tools like audiobooks and text-to-speech.

In the comments, users share that dyslexia fonts did not help them or their family. Some point out that tech tools like text-to-speech are more useful. Others warn that believing in a “quick fix” font can distract from real teaching. Some say making text clearer helps everyone, not just people with dyslexia. Overall, the community agrees that the right tools and teaching matter more than special fonts.

Another story explains that JSDoc and TypeScript are not rivals. JSDoc is just another way to use TypeScript’s type checking and tools. The Svelte project moved type info from TypeScript files to JSDoc comments, but they still use TypeScript for tooling. Even if you write only JavaScript, your editor may use TypeScript to check your code. The TypeScript team keeps adding new JSDoc features.

The author rewrote a project using only JSDoc comments and found that most things possible with TypeScript types can be done with JSDoc, though the syntax is sometimes awkward. JSDoc keeps all code and types in one file, making it easy to navigate. Many TypeScript tools work with JSDoc projects.

In the comments, some people say they use JSDoc because it fits better into JavaScript projects and avoids extra build steps. Others find JSDoc syntax harder to read and prefer TypeScript files for bigger codebases. Some like that JSDoc keeps everything together, while others worry comments can get messy. There are debates about which approach is best for teams, with some mixing both styles. Most agree the choice depends on the project and the team.

Now, let’s talk about the Typeframe PX-88, a new portable computer made for people who want both power and a good typing experience. It uses a Raspberry Pi 4 B, so it can run web editors and handle heavy tasks even though it’s small. The PX-88 has a mechanical keyboard, making typing feel better than on normal laptops. The design is open—you can easily change or fix parts without much trouble. No need for much soldering, so it’s friendly for people who want to build their own machine.

The PX-88 can be used as a “cyberdeck” for hacking or as a “writerdeck” for writers. It’s made for professionals who care about quality, not just looks.

In the comments, some people are excited about the good keyboard and small size. They say it reminds them of old computers that were easy to fix. Others wonder if the Raspberry Pi is powerful enough for serious tasks, or worry about battery life and weight. Some say the price might be high, but others think a special computer should cost more. Many like that you can access and fix all the parts, which is better than most laptops today. There are some worries about software support, but overall, people are happy to see a portable computer that is different from usual options.

Next, there’s an article about how people use computers and how this has changed. Neal Stephenson compares command line interfaces (CLIs) and graphical user interfaces (GUIs). He says Microsoft is like a big car company selling station wagons, Apple is like a fancy European car, and Linux is like driving a tank. Most people choose what is easy and familiar.

He remembers learning to program by typing commands, where you had to think about each step. With GUIs, it’s easier for beginners but hides the details. He says software uses metaphors, like “desktop” or “document,” which can be confusing if taken too seriously. Stephenson also talks about how companies make money from software, and how open source changes the business. He worries that GUIs make people too dependent on technology and less able to think for themselves, comparing modern computers to Disney World—nice on the surface, but not real.

In the comments, some say the essay is still true: people want easy interfaces even if they lose control. Others think GUIs are not bad and just help people get things done. There are debates about open source and personal stories of learning on the command line. Some worry that easy interfaces mean people never learn the basics, but others say the world needs both simple and powerful tools. Many enjoyed the essay for making them think about how technology, business, and culture connect.

Finally, we have a story about a serious npm malware hack at Trigger.dev. The attack started when an engineer installed a new npm package, which ran bad code on their laptop. The malware used TruffleHog to steal secrets like GitHub and AWS keys, then watched the engineer’s activity for 17 hours. The attacker copied 669 repositories and tried to destroy code by force-pushing empty commits and closing pull requests, all using the fake name “Linus Torvalds.”

The team noticed a flood of Slack alerts and quickly removed the hacked account from all services. They used backup info and local copies to restore all branches in seven hours. No production databases or npm packages were harmed, thanks to extra security. After the attack, Trigger.dev made many changes: npm and pnpm now ignore install scripts, safer publishing is used, branch protection is everywhere, and AWS tokens are better protected. They also recommend waiting several days before installing new packages to catch malware early.

In the comments, many developers are worried because npm allows packages to run scripts during install. Some argue that turning off install scripts will break many builds, but others say security is more important. There’s support for tools like pnpm 10 to block untrusted packages and for better secrets management. Some people blame the npm ecosystem for being too open, and others stress the need for fast team response. A few share tips, like using virtual machines for testing new packages. Many feel sorry for the engineer who got hacked and say the real lesson is to improve the ecosystem and team habits, not to blame individuals.

That’s all for today’s episode. Thanks for listening to Hacker News Daily Podcast. We hope you found these stories interesting and useful. See you next time!
