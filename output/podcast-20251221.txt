Hello everyone, this is the 2025-12-21 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we bring you stories about logging problems in software, running AI coding models on your own computer, the most mentioned books on Hacker News, how gift cards work and why they are used in scams, the latest on quantum computing, a tool for making Apple Wallet passes, new EU laws about VPNs, coding on the subway, the E.W. Dijkstra Archive, and complaints about Windows 11 upgrade reminders.

Let’s start with the first story: why logging is broken in modern software systems. The article points out that logs often miss key information and are hard to search, which makes debugging slow and painful. In the past, with just one server, logs were simple. But now, requests pass through many services and databases, yet logging still acts like it’s simple. When something goes wrong, searching logs by user ID or email gives too many or too few results, and data is often stored in different formats.

The main issue is that logs are written to be easy for developers, not for solving problems later. The author explains terms like structured logging, cardinality, and dimensionality. Structured logging helps, but it’s not enough. What you really need is a “wide event”—one big log entry for each request, with all important details, like user info, payment data, errors, and feature flags. This makes it much easier to answer questions and fix problems.

The article also talks about OpenTelemetry. It’s just a tool for moving data, not for deciding what to log. You still need to add the right business data. To save money, the author suggests sampling logs, but always keeping logs for errors, slow requests, VIP users, and special cases.

Many people in the comments agree that logs are hard to use and that wide events could help. Some like the idea but warn it’s hard to change old codebases or habits. There is debate about the cost and speed of storing big logs, but some say new databases like ClickHouse help a lot. Others share stories about missing key info in logs and having to guess what happened, while a few say good logs helped them solve big problems quickly. Overall, most agree that better, more detailed logs would save time and help everyone, but it will take work to get there.

Next, we look at whether you can save money by running AI coding models on your own computer. The author bought a powerful MacBook to see if local models could replace expensive cloud tools like Claude Code. The result: for about 90% of daily coding tasks, local models work almost as well as cloud models. Local models save money, protect your privacy, and work offline. But for the hardest 10% of coding tasks, cloud models still win. For businesses, cloud models remain the best choice.

Setting up local models takes some technical skill. You have to watch memory usage, pick the right model size, and may need to use quantization to save RAM. The author tested tools like Ollama (easy to use) and MLX (faster, Mac-only), and suggests trying different coding tools to find the best fit. They found that while local models are not perfect for professionals, they can help hobbyists or let you use cheaper cloud plans.

In the comments, many people are excited about local models, especially for privacy and saving money. Some share their own setups, while others say setup can be tricky and tools are sometimes buggy. A few agree that the last bit of quality is important for professional code. Some think as local models get better, more people will switch. Others point out that free cloud tools make it hard to justify expensive hardware, and worry that if everyone goes local, companies might raise prices for cloud tools. There are also warnings about the heat and speed of running big models, and some users like the idea of mixing local and cloud tools for the best experience.

Now, let’s talk about the books most often mentioned on Hacker News in 2025. A new tool tracks which books are popular in the tech and startup world, based on data from many podcast episodes. The article also discusses copyright issues, saying current laws may not be fair when just a few people get rich from big hits like Harry Potter. The writer says sharing creative works should help more people, not just a few. Some people find reading hard in school, but popular books like Harry Potter helped them enjoy reading again and are even used to learn new languages.

The most mentioned books in tech podcasts are “Made in America,” “7 Powers,” “Zero to One,” “Against the Odds,” and “Harry Potter.” The article also talks about book bans and the idea of separating art from the artist. When people write fan fiction or discuss books, it helps make those books more famous.

In the comments, some agree copyright should be rethought for famous books, while others think writers should keep control. Many say Harry Potter helped them love reading. There is debate about reading “high culture” versus popular books, and some talk about using books to learn languages. Some argue that once a book is very famous, maybe copyright rules should change. Overall, books and stories create strong feelings and debates about culture, reading habits, and copyright.

Next, we move to an article about how gift cards work and why scammers use them. Gift cards are big business and help people without bank accounts, but they are also easy for scammers. When someone is tricked into buying gift cards and sharing the numbers, the money is usually lost forever. Most companies do not run their own gift card systems—they use special program managers—so it’s hard to know who is responsible when things go wrong. Gift cards are not protected by the same laws as debit or credit cards, so reporting fraud often does not help.

Industry groups want gift card rules to stay simple, so only large transactions get checked. This means scammers know which cards are easiest to use. In the end, the system is built this way for good reasons, but regular people can get hurt.

In the comments, some agree gift cards need better rules, while others say they are important for people without bank accounts. Some share stories about losing money to scams. Technical readers talk about the split system making fraud hard to track. There is debate over whether stores should take more responsibility, and some doubt that warnings can stop all scams. Most agree that while gift cards are useful, the system needs to change to stop so many scams.

Now, let’s talk about quantum computing. Scott Aaronson says he is now more optimistic about useful quantum computers because of strong progress in hardware over the past year. At a big conference, he saw companies like Quantinuum and Google show real results. The main uses for quantum computers are still simulating physics, breaking some cryptography, and maybe small gains for optimization and machine learning. Hardware is improving fast, but it’s still not clear when really useful machines will arrive.

Scott warns not to believe all the hype from companies, and reminds us that the real advantage is still in physics, not in general business problems. He says moving to new “post-quantum” encryption is urgent.

In the comments, many agree that hardware is getting better, but are cautious about big promises. Some think useful quantum computing is still years away. Others defend optimism, saying all big technologies had doubters. There is debate over whether quantum computers will help with machine learning, and some warn that too much hype could waste money. Most agree that security changes for quantum should start now.

Next, we have a story about WalletWallet, a free online tool that lets you make Apple Wallet passes from any barcode. You just enter your card’s barcode, change the look if you want, and download a file to add to Apple Wallet. There is no need to sign up or install anything. The creator says your data stays private and does not leave your browser.

In the comments, people like the tool’s simplicity and free use. Some want more features, like support for Google Wallet. A few worry about privacy, but the creator says your data stays on your device. Some share stories about stores not accepting digital cards, but most think the tool is helpful and easy to use.

Now, let’s talk about Mullvad VPN warning about new EU laws called “Going Dark” or “ProtectEU.” The EU wants to give police more access to encrypted data, now including VPNs. Mullvad says these laws are about controlling people, not real security, and promises to fight them. They also say they cannot spy on users, since they do not know who their users are or keep logs.

In the comments, most people support Mullvad and worry about government overreach. Some joke about how these laws keep coming back. Others ask how Mullvad can resist if forced by law, but users explain the company’s system makes spying hard. Some compare these laws to Russia’s, and a few praise Mullvad for honesty. There is frustration that lawmakers do not understand encryption, and some wish governments would focus on real problems. Overall, most want to protect privacy and freedom.

Next is a story about coding on the subway in New York City. The writer has less free time now, so they use their commute to code. Without their usual setup, there are fewer distractions, and they focus better. Sometimes they use WiFi at stops, but mostly code offline. It’s hard to keep complex ideas in mind with the noise, so they do simpler tasks or plan in a notebook. They use an old ThinkPad, so theft is less of a worry, and sometimes people ask what they’re doing, leading to new friends.

In the comments, many like the idea and share their own stories of working on trains or buses. Some say noise and movement can be a problem, and not having internet is sometimes hard, but it also helps focus. There are tips for using tablets or notebooks when a laptop isn’t practical. Some worry about theft, but others say a cheap device is fine. Many like the social side of meeting new people. Most agree it’s a creative way to use lost time.

Now, let’s talk about the E.W. Dijkstra Archive. This website collects the writings of Edsger W. Dijkstra, a key figure in computer science. The archive has more than a thousand of his technical notes, called EWDs, which were often shared by mail and not formally published. The site makes them easier to find and read, with indexes and some transcriptions. There are also audio, video, and memories about Dijkstra’s life and work. The archive is updated sometimes and welcomes feedback and volunteers.

In the comments, many people say Dijkstra’s work shaped their thinking about programming. Some praise his clear and precise style, while others find the notes challenging but helpful. A few say the scanned PDFs are hard to read, but most are thankful for the archive. Dijkstra’s quotes and opinions are discussed, and many agree his ideas are still important, especially for learning why things work in programming.

Finally, we have a story about a user who cannot upgrade their laptop to Windows 11 because it lacks TPM 2.0, a special security chip. Microsoft keeps showing upgrade reminders, even though the computer cannot be upgraded. The user is annoyed that there is no way to say “no” or stop the messages. They feel Microsoft is trying to force people to buy new hardware and is unfriendly to users. There are also complaints about being pushed to use extra services like OneDrive.

In the comments, many agree the reminders are annoying and hard to stop. Some suggest ways to block them, but the fixes are complex or unreliable. A few defend Microsoft’s focus on security, but most think users should have more control, especially if their device cannot be upgraded. Some say this is why they use Linux or avoid Windows. There are jokes about how these reminders push people to buy new computers, and some discuss technical details about TPM 2.0. But the main complaint is about the forceful reminders and lack of a “no thanks” option.

That’s all for today’s episode. Thank you for listening to Hacker News Daily Podcast. We’ll see you next time with more news and stories from the tech world.
