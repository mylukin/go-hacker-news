## Stepping down as Mockito maintainer after 10 years

- 原文链接: [Stepping down as Mockito maintainer after 10 years](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/3777)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46414078)

The maintainer of Mockito, a popular Java testing tool, will step down after 10 years. He explains why he is leaving and what made the decision hard.

First, a big reason is a recent change in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Mockito had to make its main code an agent because JVM 22 made the old way unsafe. This change was for security but was hard for maintainers. The author felt that the people making the JVM change did not help enough. The work to support the new way was left to Mockito and its volunteers. This was tiring and made the job stressful.

Second, Kotlin is now more popular, but it is very different from other JVM languages. Mockito has to do special work just for Kotlin. Sometimes, code must be written twice to support Kotlin features. This extra work makes the code messy and hard to manage. The maintainer does not enjoy this and thinks it will only get harder as Kotlin grows.

Third, the author found more joy working on other open source projects, like Servo (a web engine in Rust). Working on Mockito started to feel like a chore instead of fun. He wants to spend his free time on things he enjoys.

In the end, all these problems together led to his decision. He believes new people, with new energy and interest in Kotlin, should take over. He is thankful for the chance to help so many developers and still recommends open source work to others.

The top Hacker News comments show mixed feelings. Some people thank the maintainer for all his hard work and say open source can be a thankless job. Others agree that big changes, like the JVM agent update, should include better support for important projects like Mockito. A few say the problems with supporting Kotlin are common for many Java libraries now. Some people mention how hard it is when open source projects depend on volunteers who can get tired or burned out. Others share stories about stepping down from their own projects and how it helped them enjoy programming again. Some worry about the future of open source tools if the work is too hard or not fun. A few say companies who use these tools should give more back, either with money or time. Many wish the maintainer good luck with new projects and thank him again for his help.

## Software engineers should be a little bit cynical

- 原文链接: [Software engineers should be a little bit cynical](https://www.seangoedecke.com/a-little-bit-cynical/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46414723)

This article says that software engineers should be a little bit cynical at work, especially in big tech companies. The writer explains why being a bit skeptical helps engineers understand how companies really work.

The author talks about how some people say his advice is too cynical, like telling engineers to make their managers happy or saying that big tech decides your projects. He shares another writer’s view, who thinks engineers should care more about doing good work than just following orders. But the author says he enjoys working in big tech and believes you can still solve important problems, even if you need to follow company rules.

He points out that some “idealist” engineers think companies are only after money and don’t care about users or good code. These people may feel the only way to be ethical is to fight against their bosses or work on open-source projects alone. The author says this view is actually more cynical than it looks, because it sees the whole world as selfish and broken.

On the other side, he argues that a little bit of cynicism is realistic and even helpful. Engineers almost always need to work with others and play some “politics” to make real changes, especially in big teams. Even if you don’t set the company’s direction, you can still have a big effect by helping turn company goals into good technical work. He compares this to public service: you may not control everything, but you can still do good.

The writer thinks being too idealistic can be harmful, because it gives engineers wrong ideas about how companies work. If you understand that sometimes you need to compromise or play “the game,” you can actually reach your goals better. He says both too much cynicism and too much idealism are bad—balance is best.

In the comments, some people agree with the main point. They say that a little cynicism helps you avoid disappointment and lets you see company problems more clearly. Others think the author is too negative, and say you should try to improve things instead of just accepting them. Some share stories of trying to make positive changes at work, but running into company politics or resistance.

A few commenters discuss if it’s possible to do good engineering in big companies at all. Some say yes, as long as you pick your battles and stay realistic. Others warn that too much cynicism can lead to burnout or giving up. One person points out that understanding company goals helps you make better technical decisions. Another says that, while managers set direction, good engineers can still influence outcomes if they learn how the company works.

Some readers also say that idealist writing can set up new engineers for failure, because it doesn’t show the tough parts of big company life. Others feel that you should still try to keep some idealism, because it gives your work meaning. Several people agree that both cynicism and idealism have their place, and the real trick is finding the right balance for your own work and happiness.

## PySDR: A Guide to SDR and DSP Using Python

- 原文链接: [PySDR: A Guide to SDR and DSP Using Python](https://pysdr.org/content/intro.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46413975)

PySDR is a free online textbook that teaches how to use software-defined radio (SDR) and digital signal processing (DSP) with Python. The guide is made for people who know Python but are new to SDR and DSP, and want to learn with clear, visual examples instead of heavy math.

The book explains key terms first: SDR means doing radio signal work with software instead of hardware, and DSP means handling signals (like radio waves) using computers. SDR devices can both receive and send radio signals—these devices connect to your computer. PySDR helps readers learn DSP basics quickly, using lots of images and animations instead of long equations. The goal is to give you the main ideas fast, so you can start using SDRs smartly, without reading a huge textbook.

The book uses Python code, with NumPy for math and Matplotlib for drawing signals. Even though Python is usually slower than C++, most heavy math is done in fast C/C++ code inside Python libraries, so things run well. If you know MATLAB, Ruby, or Perl, the switch to Python for this book should be easy. PySDR is not a full reference book, but a starter guide. It covers a whole semester’s worth of DSP basics in just a few chapters, then moves on to SDR topics.

The author, Dr. Marc Lichtman, encourages people to share the book and even help improve it. You can suggest changes on GitHub or email him. Many people have helped translate the book into other languages, and supporters are listed on the website. PySDR is free and open, licensed for non-commercial sharing and changes.

In the Hacker News comments, many users praise PySDR’s clear, simple explanations and heavy use of visuals; they say it makes learning SDR much less scary. Some readers say they wish they had this book when they were students, because other resources can be too complex or boring. Others like that it focuses on hands-on work instead of just theory. A few developers point out that Python is a good choice for learning, even though it may not be as fast as C++ for big projects. Some users share their own experiences with SDR hardware, like RTL-SDR or HackRF, and suggest that PySDR helps them use these tools. There are also comments from people who want even more advanced content, but most agree that PySDR is a great place to start. One or two mention they found small errors or things that could be clearer, but the author is quick to respond and fix things. Some wish for a printed version, but many understand why the book stays online due to its animations. Overall, the community thinks PySDR is a helpful, friendly resource for anyone curious about SDR and DSP.

## Growing up in “404 Not Found”: China's nuclear city in the Gobi Desert

- 原文链接: [Growing up in “404 Not Found”: China's nuclear city in the Gobi Desert](https://substack.com/inbox/post/182743659)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46408988)

This article tells the story of growing up in “404,” a secret nuclear city built by China in the Gobi Desert. The city was hidden from maps and was created in 1958 for the country’s atomic bomb program.

Life in 404 was very hard at first. There was almost no water, so it had to be brought in by truck, and sandstorms happened all the time. The first people in 404 were smart scientists, engineers, and skilled workers who came from all over China. They lived in simple shelters and worked to build the city and the nuclear factory by hand, even making precise parts for bombs without modern machines. During the famine years, the people in 404 almost ran out of food, but they survived by starting farms and hunting to feed themselves.

Over time, 404 became a small city. There were shops, a zoo, parks, and even a factory for making popsicles and vinegar. The city was special and had a higher status than other places nearby. Families felt proud to live there, and the license plates even showed their importance.

But living in a nuclear city meant dealing with danger. The factory and homes were kept far apart because of radiation risks. Some workers got sick from accidents, and there were strict safety rules. The author remembers stories of workers losing hair or even their furniture after contact with radioactive material. This made the idea of “clean nuclear energy” seem strange to people who lived there.

The author also shares memories of normal life: going to kindergarten, playing with friends, and wanting a younger sibling but not allowed because of the One-Child Policy. School life was mixed with reminders of the city’s secret purpose, like air-raid shelters everywhere, which were used as playgrounds by the time the author was a child.

In the end, the author describes 404 as a strange place—both a proud, close community and a city built on secrets and dangers.

People in the Hacker News comments found the article fascinating and moving. Many were surprised to learn that such a city existed and enjoyed the personal details that made the story feel real. Some readers compared 404 to secret cities in the United States and Russia, like Los Alamos, and talked about how governments kept these places hidden. Others wondered about the long-term health effects for people who lived near nuclear materials and if the government ever helped if they got sick. A few commenters discussed how isolation and secrecy can affect people’s mental health, mentioning the teacher in the story who struggled with loneliness. Some readers pointed out how hard it must have been for families to follow strict rules like the One-Child Policy in such a closed place. Others questioned if there are still secret cities today, and if people inside them know how unique their lives are. Many said the story showed both the cost and the pride of building something so important for the country. Overall, readers felt the mix of hardship, pride, secrecy, and loss made the story powerful and worth sharing.

## MongoBleed Explained Simply

- 原文链接: [MongoBleed Explained Simply](https://bigdata.2minutestreaming.com/p/mongobleed-explained-simply)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46414475)

MongoBleed is a serious security bug found in MongoDB databases, affecting all versions since 2017. The problem is in how MongoDB handles compressed messages using zlib, a tool for data compression. The bug lets anyone with access to the database, even without a password, read private information from the computer’s memory. This could include passwords, API keys, customer data, and more.

The issue happens when an attacker sends a compressed message to the database and lies about the size of the uncompressed data. For example, they can say the message is 1MB, when it is really only 1KB. The server then creates a large space in memory to fit this fake size. After decompressing, MongoDB does not check the real size and simply trusts what the attacker said. This means the rest of the memory space is filled with old data that might be left over from other operations.

Next, the attacker tricks the server into sending back this secret data. MongoDB uses BSON, a binary version of JSON, which stores message fields as strings that end with a special byte (null terminator). If the attacker sends a message without this ending, the server reads past the real message and into the leftover memory, maybe picking up private data. If there is an error, the server’s response can include parts of this data in its error message, which is sent back to the attacker.

Because this happens before any login or authentication, anyone on the internet who can talk to the database can try this attack. There are over 213,000 MongoDB servers publicly available, so the number of targets is huge. The bug has been around since a code change in 2017 and was only fixed in December 2025. The fix was simple, but it took days for MongoDB to patch their cloud service, Atlas, and even longer to tell the public.

To stay safe, users are told to update to the latest patch or turn off zlib compression in their database settings. A proof-of-concept script is already public, making the attack easy to try.

People in the comment section on Hacker News had strong opinions. Some said this is a basic security mistake and shows why C and C++ are risky for handling sensitive data. Others pointed out that exposing your database directly to the internet is never safe, and those who do so are partly at fault. Many were upset that MongoDB did not share news about the fix quickly or apologize for the risk to users.

Some users worried about how many companies might still be vulnerable because they do not update their software often. Others said the attack reminds them of the old Heartbleed bug, which also let attackers read private memory, and that this kind of problem keeps happening in popular software. A few commenters argued that having so many cloud databases accessible from the internet is a bad trend, and better defaults are needed.

There was also some discussion about how easy it is to fix the bug and whether MongoDB should have caught it during code review. Some people felt that the security community did a good job explaining and sharing the problem, while others believed MongoDB was too slow and secretive. Finally, commenters shared tips on how to detect if your server is being attacked, and stressed the importance of keeping systems up to date.

## Remembering Lou Gerstner

- 原文链接: [Remembering Lou Gerstner](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2025-12-28-Remembering-Lou-Gerstner)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46413365)

Lou Gerstner, who was IBM’s CEO from 1993 to 2002, has passed away. He led IBM during a time when the company was struggling and helped save it from breaking apart.

When Lou joined IBM, the company was in trouble. The tech industry was changing fast, and many people thought IBM should split into smaller companies. Lou did not agree. He believed IBM should stay together and focus on what customers really wanted. He stopped long, boring meetings and told people to talk honestly and listen to customers. Lou thought IBM’s main problem was that it focused too much on its own rules and not enough on helping clients. He wanted meetings and decisions to be direct, based on facts and customer needs, not company politics.

Lou made the big decision to keep IBM as one company. He saw that clients wanted one system, not lots of small, separate parts. He also knew that changing IBM’s culture was just as important as changing its strategy. He encouraged employees to be honest, challenge each other, and renew IBM’s values to fit a new era. Lou worked hard to balance short-term results with long-term innovation. Even after he left, he kept in touch with IBM leaders, giving advice but letting them make their own choices. Before IBM, Lou was successful at McKinsey, American Express, and RJR Nabisco. He later led The Carlyle Group and gave to education and science causes.

In the comments, many people thanked Lou for saving IBM and believed he was the right leader at the right time. Some said IBM was in chaos before he arrived, and his focus on customers was a big reason for the turnaround. Others pointed out that not all of Lou’s changes were popular—some employees lost jobs, and some traditions ended. A few said IBM later lost its way again, suggesting that good leadership is always needed. Some commenters remembered reading Lou’s book and found his ideas about culture and honesty useful in their own work. Others compared him to other tech leaders, saying Lou was less famous but just as important. There were also some who wondered if IBM had lost its innovative spirit after Lou, while others felt he laid a strong foundation for the future. Overall, most people agreed Lou Gerstner made a huge impact at IBM and in the business world.

## Show HN: Pion SCTP with RACK is 70% faster with 30% less latency

- 原文链接: [Show HN: Pion SCTP with RACK is 70% faster with 30% less latency](https://pion.ly/blog/sctp-and-rack/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46413053)

This article is about how adding the RACK algorithm to Pion SCTP makes data transfer much faster and with less delay. SCTP is a network protocol used to send data reliably, especially in real-time apps like WebRTC for video calls and online games.

The article explains that SCTP can send both big and small pieces of data and is good at making sure messages don’t get blocked or lost, even if network conditions change. It supports multiple apps on one connection and can switch to backup links if one fails. SCTP is used in chat apps, file transfers, multiplayer games, real-time control systems, and even for sending data between web browsers.

SCTP handles lost packets by either quickly resending missing pieces when told by the receiver or waiting for a timer to run out before resending. But these old methods are not always the best, sometimes causing too many unnecessary resends.

RACK is a new way to find lost data faster and smarter. Instead of waiting for several warning messages or timers, RACK watches the time since each packet was last seen and uses network stats to guess if something is lost. It uses a method called Tail Loss Probing (TLP) to send a test packet at the end of a data burst, helping to quickly check if any data is missing.

Tests showed that when RACK is added to Pion SCTP, data transfers are about 71% faster per CPU used, latency drops by about 27%, and fewer resources are wasted. These gains are seen in clean, simple tests and also in more complex cases with packet loss, reordering, and real-world video streaming. In some cases, like with reordering and loss, RACK improved speed by up to 44% and finished jobs twice as fast. CPU usage also dropped, showing better efficiency.

The article also talks about fixing bugs found during testing, like problems with measuring network delays or not sending quick enough responses when packets are out of order. These fixes made RACK work even better.

In the comments, some readers are excited to see SCTP and RACK improvements, noting that SCTP is often ignored compared to TCP and UDP. Others ask about real-world use cases, with some pointing out that SCTP is required for certain WebRTC features and could help multiplayer game developers. A few users wonder about SCTP’s adoption problems, saying it’s not as widely supported on all platforms, which limits its use. Some developers share stories about trying to use SCTP in the past and running into firewall or driver issues.

One commenter appreciates the deep technical testing and open-source sharing, while another asks how these improvements might help high-latency or lossy networks, like satellite links. A few people discuss whether similar RACK methods could help other protocols, like QUIC or even UDP-based transports. There’s praise for the clear benchmarks and for catching tricky bugs early, plus some hope that with these changes, more apps and tools will consider using SCTP in the future.

- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46408613)

This article is about a simple web tool that lets you print a whole year’s calendar—like 2026—on one page. The calendar is made to fit any paper size, and you can print it in landscape mode for best results.

You can fold the calendar, carry it with you, write notes on it, and see all the days of the year at once. The design is very simple: each month is shown in a table, with dates and days of the week. The website gives tips to turn off headers and footers before printing. There are links to other years and to the source code, so you can use or change it if you want. The main goal is to help people plan, keep track of time, and maybe be a little more organized.

Many Hacker News users like the idea because it is clean and free from ads or tracking. Some people say they use similar printed calendars for work or personal projects, and they find them useful for seeing vacation days, planning events, or tracking long-term goals. Others mention that this kind of calendar is good for students or families, because everyone can see the whole year at a glance.

A few users suggest ways to improve the calendar, like adding holidays, color-coding weekends, or making it possible to mark special days before printing. Some point out that there are other tools that do similar things, but they think this version is easier and more focused. One person says they like offline tools because they don’t want to depend on Google or other big companies for their calendar. Another user remembers using paper calendars in the past and feels a bit nostalgic.

Some developers wonder how the site makes the calendar fit every paper size and how it handles leap years. One commenter likes that the code is open source and easy to read. A few people ask for digital versions, but most agree the strength of this tool is its simplicity and focus on paper. Overall, the reaction is positive, with many thanking the creator for making something small, useful, and kind.

## Building a macOS app to know when my Mac is thermal throttling

- 原文链接: [Building a macOS app to know when my Mac is thermal throttling](https://stanislas.blog/2025/12/macos-thermal-throttling-app/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46410402)

This article talks about building a small macOS app to tell when a Mac is slowing down because it’s too hot (thermal throttling). The author wanted a clear way to know when their MacBook Air or MacBook Pro was getting hot and losing speed, especially since some Macs have no fans and don’t make noise to warn you.

First, the author tried using official Apple tools and commands like ProcessInfo.thermalState and powermetrics to check the Mac’s heat status. But these tools did not always match, and ProcessInfo.thermalState was not detailed enough to show exactly when the Mac was slowing down from heat. They also tried other commands, but many did not work on new Apple Silicon Macs. After more research, the author found a better method: the system’s thermald service writes the real thermal status to a notification system (notifyd), and you can read this value without needing special access or root.

With this, the author wrote a Swift code that reads the thermal pressure level directly and shows if the Mac is cool, getting warm, or too hot. They then built a simple menu bar app called MacThrottle. The app shows a colored thermometer icon and a graph of temperature and, if possible, fan speed. It also sends alerts when the Mac gets hot, and you can set it to start at login.

At first, the app needed a helper script running as root to read powermetrics, but with the new method, the app could do everything without extra permissions. To show temperature, the app uses a special but tricky API called SMC, which can be unstable and needs different keys for each Mac model. The app tries SMC first, then falls back to another method if that does not work.

The app’s graph packs a lot into a small space: colored backgrounds for heat states, a line for temperature, and a dashed line for fan speed. The author made the graph smoother by using the Mac’s GPU for drawing. Notifications can warn you when the Mac gets hot or cools down again. To install, you might need to build it yourself if you can’t run unsigned apps.

In the comments, many users thanked the author and liked the app’s simple design. Some said they also had trouble knowing when their Macs were slowing down because of heat, especially on fanless models. A few people wanted more features, like logging heat data over time, or tips on how to fix throttling. Others warned about using private APIs or reading SMC, saying these can break or change between Mac models. Some users suggested that Apple should offer these details in the system by default, so users don’t need extra apps. There were also questions about battery life, if the app itself uses much power, and if it works on older Intel Macs. One or two shared other tools they use, while a handful said they have not had heat problems with newer Macs. A few wondered if this app could be helpful for people who use their Macs for heavy tasks like coding or video editing. Overall, the comments showed interest and a wish for better thermal info on Macs.

## Show HN: Phantas – A browser-based binaural strobe engine (Web Audio API)

- 原文链接: [Show HN: Phantas – A browser-based binaural strobe engine (Web Audio API)](https://phantas.io)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46414258)

This article talks about Phantas, a web tool made to help people reach a “flow state” using sound and light from their browser. It uses the Web Audio API and works right in your browser, aiming to help with focus, deep work, or meditation.

The main idea is to use “neuro-optical entrainment”—this means combining special sounds and flashing lights to help your brain get into a certain rhythm. To use it, you need headphones because the tool plays slightly different sounds in each ear (this is called binaural beats). At the same time, your computer screen flashes with bright light. You should set your screen to full brightness, close your eyes, and let the light shine through your eyelids. The tool also lets you log how you feel before and after a session, so you can track if it helps you.

One main program is called “ALPHA (10Hz),” which is best for routine tasks, like coding or simple work. The article says you should not try too hard—just let your mind wander and relax. The settings for this mode are: frequency at 10 Hz, noise floor at 15%, master gain at 30%. There are other settings and modes, but this is the one shown.

Users can lock the screen and record session data, making it simple to follow their own progress. The idea is that by matching your brainwaves to these patterns, you might focus better or feel calmer.

In the Hacker News comments, some people are excited and curious. They mention that binaural beats and light entrainment have been studied before, and some people say they have tried similar tools with good results. Others are more skeptical—they note that scientific proof for these effects is weak or not clear. Some worry about possible risks, like triggering seizures for people with epilepsy, especially with flashing lights.

A few commenters ask about the safety of using flashing lights and strong sounds, and whether the tool gives enough warnings. Some people think it is a fun experiment, while others remember old-school programs that did similar things in the past. One user says it could be a cool way to relax, but not a miracle cure for focus. Another person likes how the tool is open and works in the browser, making it easy to try.

Overall, the comments show a mix of interest, caution, and nostalgia. Some want to see more science, others just want to play with the tool, and a few suggest useful safety features for new users.
