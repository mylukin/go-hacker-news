- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44032680)

The article talks about a new way to handle uninitialized buffers in Rust using a `Buffer` trait. This has been a long-standing issue in Rust, as uninitialized buffers can be unsafe. The `Buffer` trait allows for safe reading into uninitialized buffers and is now part of Rustix 1.0.

The `Buffer` trait helps describe buffers when using functions like `read`, which reads data into buffers. The trait offers a method to return a raw pointer and length to the buffer, and another method to confirm how many elements have been written to. This ensures that the program knows which part of the buffer is initialized, reducing the risk of errors. The trait is implemented for mutable slices and vectors, making it versatile for different use cases. For example, you can read data into a buffer without initializing it first, which can optimize performance.

In the comments, people discussed the risks of uninitialized buffers. Some mentioned that uninitialized memory can be a security risk, as seen in cases like Heartbleed. Others noted that Rust aims to avoid these risks by making it impossible to read uninitialized memory in safe code. There was debate on whether Rust should zero buffers by default, with some arguing that it might impact performance. Others pointed out that Rust's approach tries to balance safety without sacrificing speed, unlike languages like Java or C#. Some commenters shared their experiences with the complexity of using uninitialized buffers in Rust, wishing for simpler, more integrated solutions.

## Overview of the Ada Computer Language Competition (1979)

- 原文链接: [Overview of the Ada Computer Language Competition (1979)](https://iment.com/maida/computer/redref/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44048775)

The article is about a competition held in 1979 to create a new computer language for the U.S. Department of Defense, known as the Ada language competition. The goal was to develop a common language, starting with the "Strawman" requirements, and led to 16 proposals. Four languages were chosen for further development: Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow. Eventually, only the Red and Green were refined, with the Green language winning. The Red language, developed by Intermetrics, was noted for its innovation but ultimately not selected.

Intermetrics developed a working translator for Red, showcasing adaptability in a changing environment, but the translator was not a factor in the final decision. The Red language's design, detailed in a reference manual and rationale, offered insights into creating new programming languages. A paper by Mary Van Deusen later described Red's type system, contributing to its historical relevance.

In the comments, one user reflects on the "IRONMAN" document from 1977, which influenced Ada by introducing formal parameter classes ("in", "out", "in out"). This innovation improved programming languages, although it was not widely adopted in later languages like C++. The commenter suggests that understanding these parameter classes could have simplified C++ and avoided performance issues. They argue that the compiler, not the programmer, should decide how parameters are passed, a notion overlooked by many languages, including C and its derivatives.
