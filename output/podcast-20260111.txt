Hello everyone, this is the 2026-01-11 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have a lot of interesting stories and discussions from the tech world to share with you.

First, let’s talk about a problem many Mac users are facing with the new macOS Tahoe. In this latest version, Apple changed the window corners to be very large and round. At first, it looks modern, but there is a big usability issue. When you want to resize a window, the area you need to click is now mostly outside the visible window because of the big rounded corners. In older macOS versions, you could just grab the inside corner. Now, about 75% of this area is outside the window, so if you move your mouse to the corner inside the window, nothing happens. You need to move your mouse outside the edge, which feels strange and not natural. This is a big change after so many years of using computers in a certain way, and it makes resizing windows more difficult and less reliable.

Many people are making fun of the new look, calling it childish or silly, but the main concern is usability, not just style. The article uses pictures and examples to show exactly where you can grab to resize. The author says this small change makes daily work more annoying and less user-friendly.

In the comments, many users agree this design is hard to use and feels like a step backwards. Some share stories of missing the window edge and getting frustrated, while others feel Apple cares more about looks than how things actually work. A few people suggest using keyboard shortcuts or third-party apps to solve the problem, and some defend the new look, saying they got used to it or like the rounded corners. The comments show a mix of frustration, tips, and debate about what is most important in software design.

Next, we have a popular open-source project called icloudpd. This is a free command-line tool that lets you download all your photos from Apple iCloud to your own computer or server. It works on Linux, Windows, and macOS, and has almost 10,000 stars on GitHub. The project is made by volunteers, and now they are looking for new maintainers to help.

You can run the tool in many ways: as a direct app, with Docker, through PyPI, AUR, or npm, or you can build it from source. To use it, you need to change some iCloud settings, like enabling web access and turning off Advanced Data Protection. The tool can just copy new photos, sync with iCloud (deleting local files if they are removed in iCloud), or move photos by copying and then deleting them from iCloud. It supports Live Photos, RAW images, and can handle duplicate names. There are options for one-time downloads or ongoing sync, and you can control how often it checks for new photos.

The tool supports two-factor authentication and lets you check if your session is active. It is open-source under an MIT license, with good documentation and ways to get support or report bugs.

From the comments, many people are happy with this tool because Apple does not make it easy to get all your photos out of iCloud, especially on non-Apple devices. Some use it to move family photos to their own storage or backups. Others warn that Apple changes their iCloud system sometimes, which can break tools like this, so you may need to wait for updates. Some people use it on servers or NAS devices and like the automation. There are wishes for official Apple tools, but people are glad open-source projects exist. Some developers warn about privacy risks and suggest reading the code or using accounts with limited access. There are a few complaints about trouble with two-factor authentication and having to log in again. Many thank the maintainers for making it easier to control their own data.

Now, let’s look at a new game engine project that uses dynamic signed distance fields, or SDFs, to let players change the game world in more detailed ways. Most games today, like Minecraft or No Man’s Sky, only let you change the world in simple, blocky ways. This new engine can make smoother holes, tunnels, and moving empty spaces that can appear or disappear during gameplay.

The creator explains how SDFs work and shows that ray-marching with SDFs can be slow, so he uses tricks like caching distances and using a brick-map system to save memory and make updates fast. The engine does not use triangle meshes, but still supports large open worlds using geometry clipmaps. There are sections about big memory savings, fast updates, physics, and even terrain as SDFs. The creator is already working on a game with this engine and is excited for new gameplay ideas.

In the comments, people are excited about the technical progress. Some say this is what they want in games—more ways to interact, not just better graphics. Suggestions include using the engine for snowboarding games, or making puzzles with negative SDFs. There is praise for the smart use of brick maps and geometry clipmaps. Some people remember popular SDF tutorials and see this project as part of a bigger community. Others want to see SDF-based collision or physics in the future. Overall, there is a lot of excitement for new game ideas and respect for the technical work.

Next, we have a project called go-kata, which gives daily coding challenges, or “katas,” to help experienced developers learn idiomatic Go. The idea is to help people write code that follows Go’s best practices, especially in areas like concurrency, memory, and error handling. The katas are grouped by topic, covering things like context and cancellation, performance, HTTP servers, error handling, and testing.

The process is simple: pick a kata, try to solve it, then compare your answer to a reference solution. This project is not for learning Go from scratch, but for helping people who know the basics write better, more “Go-like” code.

In the comments, many say this is a good idea, especially for those coming to Go from other languages. People like that the katas are practical and based on real-world problems. Some say learning idiomatic Go is hard, and this kind of practice helps avoid mistakes. A few want more beginner exercises or more coverage of the standard library. Some say real projects are also important, and others want more tests or explanations in the solutions. Most agree that this project is helpful for experienced developers who want to improve quickly in Go.

Now, there is a new tool that lets people chat with an AI version of Jeffrey Epstein using iMessage. The website says you can talk to this AI or even “start interrogation.” It was built by a developer or team at photon.codes, and there is a Discord community for discussion. The site is very simple, with just links and an invitation to chat. There is not much information about how the AI was trained or how it handles sensitive topics. The project seems like a tech demo or curiosity, more than a serious tool.

In the comments, some people say this project is in poor taste or disrespectful, since Epstein was a criminal. Others see it as a tech experiment and not serious. Some worry about legal or ethical problems with making bots of real people, especially controversial ones. A few say using iMessage is clever, and others ask about how the AI was built. Some warn that chatting with this bot could be risky or upsetting. There are jokes, and some developers find the idea creative but say it needs better warnings. Others say this shows both the good and bad sides of modern AI, and a few are interested in making similar bots with other famous or historical figures.

Next, we have the monthly open thread on Hacker News, where people share what they are building or learning. Projects range from web apps for organizing bookmarks, to websites for learning languages, to AI-powered tools like chatbots and article summarizers. Some people are working on open-source libraries, new JavaScript frameworks, or tools for working with databases. Others are building hardware like smart home devices or custom keyboards. There are people learning new programming languages like Rust, making mobile apps, or studying cloud computing. Some talk about freelancing, starting businesses, or making games. There are also blogs, newsletters, and requests for feedback on projects.

In the comments, people are supportive, giving advice and resources, and pointing out bugs or suggesting features. Some celebrate progress, others ask technical questions. There are tips for staying productive, and some discuss business topics like finding customers or making money. A few worry about competition or originality, but most enjoy the community’s creativity. Many thank each other and encourage everyone to keep building.

Let’s turn to Gentoo Linux and its progress in 2025. The review covers new features, community activity, technical updates, and plans for 2026. Gentoo added four new developers from different backgrounds, managed over 31,000 ebuilds for almost 20,000 packages, and released 89GB of binary packages. There was a small drop in code commits and bug reports, but more bugs were fixed than received. The user-contributed GURU repository had less activity, but more helpers.

Big updates include moving from Github to Codeberg because of Copilot concerns, finalizing EAPI 9 for better build tools and error handling, and attending open source events. Gentoo improved support for RISC-V, released WSL images for Windows users, and dropped support for old hardware like hppa and sparc. Packages got updates like support for new GPG providers, zlib-ng, a jobserver for better build management, and easier bootstrapping for Rust, Ada, and D. Documentation and the wiki saw many updates, and Gentoo’s finances remain stable, with most income from small donations and a slow transition to Software in the Public Interest.

In the comments, users praise Gentoo’s flexibility and technical depth. Some share their long experience with Gentoo, while others find it too complex for daily use. Many like the move to Codeberg and see it as support for open source values, though some worry about losing visibility. The new WSL images got people excited, but some question if Gentoo fits WSL users. Users discuss the new jobserver and EAPI 9, with mixed opinions on the learning curve. The RISC-V focus is popular, but some miss support for old hardware. Financial transparency is appreciated, and the documentation and workshops get positive feedback. Overall, there is respect for Gentoo’s unique place in the Linux world, even from those who do not use it every day.

Another article looks at the famous book "Chariots of the Gods?" by Erich von Däniken, which claims that ancient people were visited by aliens who changed human history. The article does not try to disprove every detail, but shows that von Däniken’s way of arguing is flawed. He says statues or carvings look like spaceships to him, so they must be proof of aliens, but experts say these are normal historical art. He also claims that if science cannot explain something, it must be aliens, but scientists have real explanations for things like the Iron Pillar or Easter Island statues. The article warns that von Däniken sometimes skips facts or leaves out information. Readers are told to use common sense and not believe something just because it is written in a book. The author suggests using simple explanations first and respecting real historical achievements.

In the comments, some agree and say von Däniken’s ideas are fun stories but not real history. His books made some people interested in science, even if the claims are weak. A few defend him, saying wild questions can help us see history in new ways. Some are upset about his use of bad facts, while others warn that too much skepticism can also be a problem. There is discussion about the responsibility of writers and the need for better science education. Many say it is important to remember the real work of ancient people, not give credit to aliens. Most agree that curiosity is good, but it is important to check the facts before believing strange claims.
