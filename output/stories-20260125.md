## OnePlus update blocks downgrades and custom ROMs by blowing a fuse

- 原文链接: [OnePlus update blocks downgrades and custom ROMs by blowing a fuse](https://consumerrights.wiki/w/Oneplus_phone_update_introduces_hardware_anti-rollback)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46757944)

OnePlus has released a new update for several phones that stops users from downgrading to older software or installing custom ROMs. The update uses a hardware fuse inside the phone’s chip — once the fuse is “blown,” you cannot go back to old software, and trying to do so will break the phone for good.

This affects OnePlus 13, 15, Ace 5, and some OPPO devices. The fuse is inside the Qualcomm processor and changes forever when you install the update. If you try to put on older software after, the phone will not turn on, and only a full motherboard replacement can fix it. Even using special recovery tools (like EDL mode) will not help. OnePlus has not given any official reason for this change.

Before, OnePlus was popular with users who liked to mod their phones and install different software. Their first phone even launched with a custom ROM called CyanogenMod. Over time, OnePlus merged its software with OPPO's ColorOS, but still kept some support for custom ROMs.

Now, with this update, all current custom ROMs stop working for these devices. Many users did not know about the fuse change and have broken their phones trying to downgrade. The community warns everyone not to update to any version ending in .500, .501, or .503 unless it is proven safe. If you already updated, do not flash any custom ROM unless it is made for the fused version.

Technically, the process is simple but final: when you update, the phone checks the software version and if you try to install something older, it refuses to start. The electronic fuse change cannot be reversed by software. Only replacing the whole motherboard works.

In the Hacker News comments, many people are angry and worried. Some say this move goes against the “right to repair” and hurts the custom ROM community. Others point out that most phone users never change their software, so this only affects a small group. Some compare it to Samsung’s Knox, which also uses a fuse, but Samsung does not usually brick phones if you try to unlock them.

A few users defend OnePlus, saying maybe this is for security or to stop people from bricking their phones by mistake. But many feel betrayed, since OnePlus was known for being modder-friendly. Commenters note that OnePlus has not explained the change, and removing downgrade downloads makes it look intentional. Some worry that more companies will do the same, making phones harder to repair or modify. Others suggest this is planned obsolescence or just a way to control users. In the end, most agree this is a big loss for power users and developers who like to tinker with their devices.

## First, make me care

- 原文链接: [First, make me care](https://gwern.net/blog/2026/make-me-care)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46757067)

This article talks about how to write nonfiction that grabs people’s attention. The author says most essays start with boring facts and history, which makes readers stop reading. Instead, writers should first make readers care by showing why a topic is interesting or strange.

The article gives an example about Venice, a city that became a big sea empire even though it had no farms. The author points out that most essays about Venice start with slow background from the fall of Rome and migrations, but this does not make you want to read more. Even if the facts are true, it is not exciting. The author says editing or adding more details cannot fix this problem because it is not about the facts; it is about making people curious.

To show a better way, the author suggests starting with a question: "How did Venice feed itself, and why didn’t its enemies starve it out?" This makes readers want to know the answer. The article gives a lively example, showing Venice as a powerful city full of secrets, gold, and ships—but no farms. This creates a puzzle. The writer then asks, how did Venice survive and grow with no farms? That question hooks the reader. After grabbing attention, the writer can then explain the details and history. The main idea is: if you want people to read, you must first make them care.

In the comments, many people agree with the article’s advice. Some say they now notice how often introductions are boring and full of background. Others share their own tricks to hook readers, like starting with a story or a strange fact. A few point out that not every topic can be made interesting, but most can be improved. Some readers warn that clickbait titles can work, but you must deliver on the promise or people will feel cheated. Others say they like introductions that quickly show why something matters, not just what happened. A few writers admit they struggle with starting strong and will try these tips. Some discuss if AI can ever write in a way that truly grabs attention, or if that’s just a human skill. One reader says they now see why some Wikipedia articles are hard to finish—they start with dry history, not the good parts. Many agree: to get readers, first make them care.

- 原文链接: [Canada](https://www.jenn.site/on-canada/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46758242)

This article is about what it means to grow up in Canada, told by someone who moved there as a child and now often visits the US. The writer shares stories about how Canada helped their family when they were poor, giving them money, a place to live, and access to public services.

The writer talks about free or low-cost programs at local community centers, like swimming and skating lessons. These helped them join in with friends and feel part of Canadian life. Libraries in Canada are open to everyone, and the writer remembers being able to borrow as many books as they wanted—something they didn’t have in China. Charities gave toys and food at holidays, making special days feel magical even when money was tight.

The government also gave free or cheap tickets to museums, science centers, and events. The writer spent a lot of time at these places, learning and having fun, even when their family couldn’t afford much. When the writer grew up, Canada continued to help with things like unemployment insurance and health care for their mother. They say that being Canadian gives a sense of security and freedom to make good choices in life.

The writer knows Canada has problems, like expensive housing, not enough opportunities, and some public services falling apart. Still, they feel Canada is better for families than the US, where many safety nets don’t exist. They think growing up in Canada made them more open and hopeful, and they want to help make the country better.

In the comments, some people agree that Canada’s social programs and public services are special and important. They share their own stories about libraries, skating rinks, and how helpful government support can be. Others point out problems, saying that it’s getting harder to afford living in Canada, and not everyone can use these services as easily as the writer did. Some mention that in bigger cities, waiting times for health care or help with housing can be long.

There is also discussion about how Canada compares to the US. Some readers think the US could learn from Canada’s approach to helping families and children. Others say that Canada’s system is not perfect, and there are still people who fall through the cracks. A few people talk about how important community is, and how public spaces bring people together. Some readers wish their country had more of these things, while others warn that these programs need protection or they might disappear.

Many readers thank the writer for reminding them what makes Canada special. Some say the story made them feel proud to be Canadian, while others share ideas for how to fix problems. Overall, the comments show both love for Canada’s good parts and concern for the things that are not working well.

## A macOS app that blurs your screen when you slouch

- 原文链接: [A macOS app that blurs your screen when you slouch](https://github.com/tldev/posturr)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46754944)

This article is about a macOS app called Posturr that blurs your screen when you slouch at your desk. The app uses your Mac’s camera and Apple’s Vision framework to check your posture in real-time.

Posturr works by tracking your body pose and face with the camera. If it sees that you are slouching, it starts to blur your screen. The more you slouch, the stronger the blur gets. If you sit up straight again, the blur goes away right away. You can control and set up the app from a menu bar icon. Settings let you change how sensitive the app is, how much slouch is allowed before blurring, and you can recalibrate your “good posture.” The app works with more than one screen and tries to use as little computer power as possible. All the posture checking happens on your own computer, so no video or data leaves your Mac. You need to give the app permission to use your camera, and the first time you open it, you have to bypass macOS security because the app is not signed by Apple. There is also a “Compatibility Mode” in case the normal blur doesn’t work on your system. The app is open-source, free to use, and you can build it yourself if you want.

In the comments, many people find the idea clever and funny. Some say it might be too strict or could get annoying if it blurs the screen too quickly. A few worry about privacy and do not like the camera being on all the time, even if the app says it does not send data anywhere. Others like that the app is local and does not need an account or internet. Some users suggest adding other alerts, like a sound or a pop-up, instead of just blurring the screen. A few people think this app could help people who forget to sit up straight, while others worry it might not work well with different body types or if the lighting is bad. One person asks about support for external cameras. Another wonders if the app could be helpful in schools or offices. Some mention that sitting straight all the time is not always healthy, and moving around is also important. A few users talk about technical details, like the use of private APIs for blurring and how that might cause trouble with Apple’s App Store rules. Overall, the idea is seen as fun and useful for some, but maybe not for everyone.

## Spanish track was fractured before high-speed train disaster, report finds

- 原文链接: [Spanish track was fractured before high-speed train disaster, report finds](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1m77dmxlvlo)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46757162)

A new report says the train track in Spain was broken before a high-speed train crashed and killed 45 people. The crash happened when an Iryo train derailed and hit another train run by Renfe, the state company. 

The first report from the CIAF investigation group found a 40cm gap in the track. This gap came before the crash. Grooves were seen on the wheels of the Iryo train and also on three other trains that used the same track before. The report says these grooves match what you would see if a track was already cracked. Carriages two, three, and four of the Iryo train had these marks. Carriage five, which did not derail, had a groove that suggests the rail was starting to tilt. The last three carriages (six to eight) left the track and hit the Renfe train. Most of the people who died or got hurt were in the front of the Renfe train. The crash happened around 19:45, about an hour after the Iryo train left Málaga for Madrid. The transport minister said it is too early to know for sure, but if the break caused the crash, it may have happened just before and was hard to find in time. This is the worst rail crash in Spain in over ten years.

Hacker News users had different thoughts. Some people said more sensors and better track checking could have stopped the crash. Others asked why the broken track was not found, and if inspections are too few or not careful enough. A few comments noted that sometimes, even with checks, breaks can happen fast and are hard to catch. Some users said private and public rail companies must work together more to keep tracks safe. A few people brought up the 2013 crash, saying Spain’s rail system is usually very safe, but things can still go wrong. There were also questions about who is responsible—maintenance workers, managers, or the train companies. Some users discussed how high-speed trains need special care, and small problems can quickly turn into big disasters. Others wanted to know if climate or weather made the track weaker. Overall, users agreed that train safety is very important and that learning from this crash is necessary to stop it from happening again.

## I was right about ATProto key management

- 原文链接: [I was right about ATProto key management](https://notes.nora.codes/atproto-again/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46757357)

The article is about the author’s experience trying to set up a fully independent Bluesky (ATProto) account, using their own server and domain, instead of depending on Bluesky’s company servers. The author wanted to prove that real decentralization was possible, but ran into many problems.

They first set up the server software (PDS) on their own machine, which was easy. Next, they tried to create a new cryptographic identity (did:web) by following an online tutorial, but the guide was outdated and missed an important step. After uploading the necessary files and adjusting settings like DNS and CORS, they tried to create an account, but it stayed stuck in “deactivated” mode. There was almost no clear documentation, so they had to piece together help from a closed GitHub issue and Discord chats.

After advice from the Discord, they deleted the account and started over, finally finding a comment about a secret step: copying a special key from a server endpoint and manually editing it into their identity document. Even then, things didn’t work—when they tried to log in, Bluesky told them their profile didn’t exist. 

They then discovered that deleting the account had “burned” their identity: their domain was now blocked from using Bluesky’s central AppView, and only company support could fix it. The author says this shows why ATProto’s key management is too hard for most people—there’s little support, poor documentation, and lots of manual steps. They compare it to running a Mastodon server, saying this is actually harder and more fragile.

In the comment section, some readers agree strongly with the author, saying the current process is much too complex for ordinary users, and that true decentralization should not rely on company support. Others point out that key management is always hard, but that better tools and guides could help. A few believe that Bluesky is still moving in the right direction, and that these are early-stage problems that will get fixed over time. Some compare Bluesky’s issues to Mastodon and other federated systems, noting that every network has trade-offs between security and ease of use. There are also comments questioning whether real decentralization is possible if a single company can still burn or block users at will. Others feel that expecting end-users to handle cryptography and server setup will never scale, and that most people will just keep using centralized services. Some hope the community will write better documentation and tools, but others are skeptical that this will ever be easy enough for normal users. In the end, the discussion shows a real split: some are hopeful, but many see Bluesky as not yet truly decentralized in practice.

## Using PostgreSQL as a Dead Letter Queue for Event-Driven Systems

- 原文链接: [Using PostgreSQL as a Dead Letter Queue for Event-Driven Systems](https://www.diljitpr.net/blog-post-postgresql-dlq)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46755115)

This article talks about using PostgreSQL as a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for event-driven systems, instead of using Kafka for this job. The author worked on a system at Wayfair that processed business reports using event streams and noticed that failures were common—sometimes APIs were down, or data was broken, and these failures needed a careful way to handle them. The first idea was to use a Kafka DLQ, but it was hard to see or search for failed events inside Kafka; it needed extra tools and was not easy for debugging or retries.

So, they decided to store failed events in a special DLQ table inside PostgreSQL, which they already used. This made failures easy to see and manage. Each failed event was saved with its data, error reason, and a simple status like “PENDING” or “SUCCEEDED”. The table used JSONB to save the whole event, had fields for retry count, and timestamps for tracking. Indexes were added to make searches fast for retries or checking failures.

For retrying, they built a scheduler that looked for PENDING events and tried to process them again. They used ShedLock to make sure only one retry job ran at a time, even if the system had many servers. Retries happened every six hours, up to fifty events at a time, and events with too many retries were skipped. PostgreSQL’s “FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED” made sure different servers worked on different failed events without overlap.

This setup made it easy for engineers to see, understand, and fix failures using plain SQL. Bad events were not lost or hidden—they stayed visible until fixed. The whole process made the system more stable and less stressful to run.

People in the comments had lots of thoughts. Some liked the idea of using PostgreSQL for DLQ, saying it made things easier to query and debug. Others worried about mixing different types of data (like DLQ and main data) in the same database, which might cause problems as things grow. Some pointed out that PostgreSQL is not built for very high message throughput, so this works best when there aren’t thousands of failures every second. A few people said that for simple or smaller teams, this approach is great, but big companies with huge data loads might still need something like Kafka DLQ. Others shared that they used similar ideas with other databases or even plain files, and that the main win is being able to see and act on failures easily. Some users liked the “boring is good” approach for production systems, while others warned to keep an eye on database size and long-term storage. Overall, most agreed this was a smart, practical solution for many real-world cases.

## Doom has been ported to an earbud

- 原文链接: [Doom has been ported to an earbud](https://doombuds.com)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46753484)

Someone made the classic 1993 game DOOM run on a wireless earbud called the Pinebuds Pro. The project lets people play DOOM through their browser by controlling the game running on real earbud hardware over the internet.

To do this, the creator had to work around many limits. Earbuds don’t have screens, so the video is sent out using a fast UART connection instead of slow Bluetooth. They used MJPEG (a stream of JPEG images) rather than modern video codecs, because those need too much CPU and memory. The Pinebuds Pro’s hardware had to be pushed: the CPU was set to run three times faster than normal, and other features were turned off to free up RAM and space. Regular DOOM needs 4MB of RAM, but these earbuds only have about 1MB, so many optimizations were made, like making variables smaller and moving data to flash memory. The game’s data file (WAD) was also too big, so a smaller version called “Squashware” was used.

The setup has four main parts: the DOOM port on the earbud, a serial server to bridge the earbud and web, a web server to manage players and stream video, and a web page for players to interact with the game. Because bandwidth is expensive, only people near the front of the queue get a direct video stream; others watch on Twitch.

People in the Hacker News comments were impressed and thought the project was both funny and clever. Some said this was a true example of “because I can” hacking, showing how far old games can be pushed onto strange hardware. Others wondered about the point, but agreed it was a fun technical challenge. Some readers liked that the code and instructions were open, so others with Pinebuds Pro could try it too. There was talk about how DOOM runs on almost anything, and jokes about it being a test for all new hardware. A few people discussed the technical tricks, especially how the JPEG encoding and RAM savings were managed. One person noted that the Pinebuds Pro is special for having open firmware, making these hacks possible. Others thought the queue and Twitch integration was a smart way to handle streaming to many users. Some joked about the “atrocious” frontend code, but said it added to the DIY charm. Overall, the comment section was full of praise, curiosity, and classic DOOM jokes.

## A flawed paper in management science has been cited more than 6k times

- 原文链接: [A flawed paper in management science has been cited more than 6k times](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2026/01/22/aking/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46752151)

A management science paper with big mistakes has been cited over 6,000 times. Many researchers have used this paper in their work, even though its main idea is not correct.

The article says the paper makes a math error that changes the results. The wrong math leads other people to believe things that are not true about management. Some experts saw the problem early, but the paper still became popular. It was published in an important journal, so many read and trusted it. Because of this, the mistake spread to business schools and many research projects. The article explains how hard it is to fix these mistakes once they are in the literature. Even when people point out the problem, it takes a long time for others to notice. Researchers keep citing the flawed paper, sometimes without reading it closely. This shows how mistakes in science can be copied by many people. The article also says that peer review does not always catch errors, especially when a paper is famous. The author hopes that talking about these mistakes will help others be more careful.

In the comments, some people are surprised that such a big error was missed. Others point out that this happens a lot in science, not just management. One commenter says that researchers are under pressure to publish, so they do not always check sources well. Another person thinks journals should correct or retract bad papers faster. Some say that people often trust papers just because they are popular or from big names. Others argue that it is hard to check every detail in every paper. Some people share stories of finding mistakes in their field, too. A few think the problem is with the system, not just one paper. One person suggests using better software tools to catch errors. Another says students should learn how to spot bad research early. Many agree that science works best when mistakes are found and fixed, but it can be slow.

## AI Tribalism

- 原文链接: [AI Tribalism](https://nolanlawson.com/2026/01/24/ai-tribalism/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46758175)

This article talks about how people now form strong groups, or “tribes,” around the topic of AI in software development. The author shares how, at first, they thought large language models (LLMs) were just toys and not useful for real coding, but now they use AI for most of their daily work.

The author noticed that online debates about AI have become more like political fights, with people choosing sides instead of having open talks. Early on, many who liked crypto were quick to jump on the AI trend, which made the author feel skeptical. At the same time, many smart engineers did not trust LLMs because of their mistakes and slow speed. But in 2025, something changed—tools like Claude Code became much better, and suddenly it made sense to use them for most coding tasks, even for someone who types fast.

Even though AI still sometimes makes mistakes, it can now find bugs, fix them, and even help with security and performance. The author feels unsure about what it means to be a programmer when AI does so much of the work. They also point out that if AI can fix its own errors by using more AI, it might not matter if it’s inefficient, as long as it’s “good enough” and cheaper than hiring people.

The article warns that many developers still hold onto old ideas, maybe out of fear, and that tribal thinking stops honest discussion about AI’s true impact. The author believes the real truth is that nobody really knows what will happen next with AI, and suggests everyone should stay curious, try things out, and have empathy for others who feel differently.

In the comments, one reader says they dislike AI but accept that it has some value. They refuse to use it until they have no other choice, thinking it’s not worth learning now since AI changes so quickly and will get easier to use anyway. The author replies that this is a fair point and that learning AI tools later was not hard for them either, but they are glad they didn’t wait.

Another comment comes from someone who loves working with LLMs. They compare it to learning to code alone, then with the internet, and now with AI as a friendly helper who never judges. They warn that you can’t trust AI blindly since it lacks real-world context, but say that AI makes them excited about building projects again.

The author responds that many people feel the same excitement, but that they personally still worry about how AI is changing software jobs. They also admit that they have felt put off by the attitude of some AI fans, but they are trying to stay open-minded. Overall, the comments show both excitement and doubt, with some people eager for AI, and others cautious or even resistant, but open to change in the future.
