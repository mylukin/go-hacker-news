Hello everyone, this is the 2026-01-15 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we bring you the latest stories and discussions from the world of technology, software, and the internet.

First, let’s look at the changing relationship between Apple, Nvidia, and TSMC. TSMC is the world’s top chip maker, and for many years, Apple was its biggest customer. But now, Nvidia and other AI companies like AMD, Google, and Amazon are ordering so many chips that TSMC’s factories are full. Nvidia’s demand is growing faster than Apple’s, and at times, Nvidia has even passed Apple as TSMC’s largest customer. This is because AI chips are now a bigger part of TSMC’s business than smartphone chips.

TSMC recently raised its prices, so Apple has to pay more. But the bigger challenge is factory space. TSMC is careful not to expand too quickly—even though some believe it should build more factories to meet AI demand. The CEO worries that if AI demand drops, TSMC could be stuck with empty and expensive factories. Apple’s orders are steady and come from many factories, while Nvidia’s are huge but focused on the latest technology. If the AI boom slows, Apple’s stable business will still be important. For now, though, Nvidia is driving most of TSMC’s growth.

In the Hacker News comments, people see this as a normal part of tech industry change. Some worry about what happens if the AI bubble bursts, while others point out that Apple remains important for stability. Many agree that TSMC holds a lot of power—whoever controls the best chip factories can shape the tech world. There’s also debate about TSMC’s expansion plans, and comparisons to companies like Intel. Some discuss how these supply battles could affect prices and innovation, and the risk of shortages pushing up costs across the whole industry.

Next, we look at the Internet Archive, the group that tries to save the web’s history. Working out of an old church in San Francisco, the Archive uses a custom storage system called PetaBox. It relies on normal computer parts and natural cooling from San Francisco’s air, storing over 200 petabytes of data across about 20,000 hard drives. When drives fail, they are replaced only when needed.

To save web pages, the Archive started with a crawler called Heritrix, which still works well for simple sites but struggles with modern, JavaScript-heavy pages. Newer tools like Brozzler and Umbra can handle more modern content. Anyone can use "Save Page Now" to quickly add a web page. The Archive’s money mostly comes from donations and grants, with extra income from services like Archive-It and digitizing books. By using open-source software and building its own hardware, the Archive keeps costs low.

Legal issues are a big worry. The Archive lost a lawsuit from book publishers for lending scanned books during Covid, and had to remove many books and limit music access. In 2025, it became a Federal Depository Library, which gives special protection for saving US government documents. To protect against possible disasters or shutdowns, the Archive is working on decentralization—using tools like IPFS and Filecoin to copy its data around the world. AI is also being used to help organize and scan content.

Hacker News users praise the Archive’s creativity, especially the PetaBox and natural cooling. Some worry about legal risks and the future of public access to information. Others debate copyright, and many share stories of saving lost web pages thanks to the Archive. There’s a lot of support for decentralization, but also questions about quality and copyright. Most agree that the Archive is vital for saving the history of the internet.

Now, let’s talk about Svelte’s recent security updates. The Svelte team reported five important security problems in its tools and libraries, including devalue, svelte, @sveltejs/kit, and @sveltejs/adapter-node. Some issues let attackers use up all the app’s memory, cause crashes, or even run harmful code through XSS. Users are told to update their packages as soon as possible.

The team thanks the community for helping fix these problems quickly. They plan to improve their processes to catch bugs earlier and ask that new issues be reported privately. In the comments, people thank Svelte for being open and fast to respond. Many see this as a reminder to keep dependencies updated. There’s talk about how tricky user input features can be, and some want better tools for checking risky settings. While some wish updates were easier for big projects, most agree that quick and open responses are what really matter in security.

Moving on, we have JuiceFS, an open-source file system that lets you use cloud storage like S3 as if it were a normal disk. JuiceFS stores data in object storage and keeps metadata in fast databases like Redis or MySQL. It supports POSIX, works with Hadoop and Kubernetes, and offers strong consistency and high performance. Data is kept safe with encryption, and the system is easy to set up and use with most Linux tools. JuiceFS is open source and supports many storage backends.

Hacker News users are impressed with JuiceFS’s ease of use and speed, especially compared to S3FS or EFS. Some warn about the risks of using Redis for metadata and suggest careful planning. There are questions about performance for very high-speed needs and the costs of cloud storage at scale. People like the open-source nature and friendly community. Many see JuiceFS as a strong choice for cloud storage, but with some points to consider for special workloads.

Switching to a more human topic, there’s a post about loneliness and what we can do about it. Many people—even those with jobs or families—feel alone and want deeper connections. Reasons include remote work, too much time online, and moving far from family. The article suggests joining local clubs, volunteering, or attending community events. It also says workplaces and cities can help by creating social spaces.

In the comments, people share their own stories of loneliness, especially after moving to new places. Some blame technology for making face-to-face contact harder, while others suggest small hobby groups or coding meetups as a solution. There’s talk about building deeper friendships and the need to teach social skills in schools. Some say loneliness is normal sometimes, but most agree that reaching out—even in small ways—can help everyone feel more welcome.

Another article explores how Claude, an AI tool, performs in real software engineering tasks. Claude is very good at using existing building blocks and automating routine work, but struggles to create new solutions from scratch. For example, Claude fixed a bug quickly and did a cloud migration well, but failed to clean up messy React code, suggesting a simple but poor fix. The author says Claude is like a smart kid who can build with legos, but can’t invent new ones.

In the comments, readers agree that AI is great for repetitive work but still needs human guidance for tough or creative problems. Some are impressed by how fast AI is improving, while others worry about companies relying too much on AI for real code. There’s debate about whether AI will ever be able to design new abstractions, but most agree that experienced engineers are still very important.

Next, we have Aviator, a Y Combinator startup building a multiplayer AI coding platform to help teams work faster. Aviator’s tools are already used by companies like Slack, Figma, and DoorDash. They offer MergeQueue to prevent code merge problems, FlexReview to route code reviews, and Runbooks—an AI agent that helps automate hard tasks using plain language.

Aviator believes AI will help small teams do much more, not replace engineers. The company is hiring and looking to grow. Hacker News users are interested in the idea of AI making teams more productive, but some worry about AI taking over too much and reducing creativity or jobs. There are questions about how the tools fit with real teams and concerns about privacy. Some see joining Aviator now as a big opportunity, while others want to know more about how the AI works.

Then, there’s OpenWork, a new open-source app inspired by Claude Cowork, but free and fully open. OpenWork lets you use AI agents in a desktop app, save workflows as templates, and add new features called “skills.” It is built on OpenCode and supports both local and remote work. The app is still new, but already supports templates, plugins, and live updates.

In the comments, users like having a free, open alternative to commercial AI agents. Some ask about setup, platform support, and the need for both Rust and Node.js. There are questions about how safe it is to let AI agents change files and whether the app will support more AI models. Some want a web version, and others think the project is promising but want to wait for more updates before using it in real work.

Finally, there’s a project that lets you compile Go 1.24 code for Windows XP. This is a special fork of Go, with changes to support old Windows system calls and bring back classic features like `go get` without modules. You can use pre-built files or build it from source, and the project welcomes feedback.

People have mixed feelings about this. Some are surprised anyone still supports XP, but others say it’s needed for old hardware or special software. There are warnings about security risks and questions about the effort needed to keep Go working on XP. Some like the return of classic `go get`, while others think it might be better to use older Go versions for XP. Overall, the project gets respect for the effort, but most agree it’s not practical for most users.

That’s all for today’s episode. We hope you found these stories and discussions helpful and thought-provoking. Thank you for listening to Hacker News Daily Podcast. We’ll be back tomorrow with more news and ideas from the world of technology.
