Hello everyone, this is the 2026-02-26 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have a lot of tech stories to share, from Wi-Fi security research to new AI tools, offline navigation updates, and even a story about baking pies every day. Let’s get started.

Our first story looks at Wi-Fi “client isolation,” a feature that should stop devices on the same network from talking to each other. Researchers tested how well client isolation works on home and business Wi-Fi routers, and their results are worrying. Most routers use a “group key” to send messages to all users, and this key is given to every device. Even with client isolation turned on, an attacker on the same network can use this key to send fake messages or attack other users. Some routers only block direct connections at the MAC address level, but attackers can still send packets through the router’s gateway—a trick called “gateway bouncing.” Attackers can also fake another device’s address to steal its traffic or make the router send the victim’s messages to the attacker. The researchers found that these attacks work on many popular routers and even some university networks. They tested many devices and found that Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS often accept these fake packets. In the worst case, attackers can read and change all of a victim’s internet traffic, even some HTTPS connections.

In the comments, people were surprised that such basic attacks still work in 2026. Many thought client isolation was a strong defense, but now see it is only a quick fix—not a real solution. Some point out that the lack of a standard for client isolation means router makers all do it differently, often with mistakes. A few users ask about using VLANs for better isolation, but say VLANs are rare in home networks. Developers worry about IoT devices, since these often join guest networks and are not as safe as people think. Even expensive business routers are not safe unless set up with extra care. Some people suggest using end-to-end encryption, like VPNs, for real security. Others are happy the research code is open source, so anyone can check their own network. Many agree that Wi-Fi security needs better standards and clearer options, because most users just trust the default settings and might not be protected.

Next, let’s talk about Cardboard, a new AI video editor. Cardboard promises to turn raw video clips into a finished video in just a few minutes. It can cut out silences, add captions, and make other changes with just a few clicks or plain language commands. Cardboard has special tools for vlogs, podcasts, launch videos, and more. You can search for clips based on what happens in them, not just their names. Teams can edit together live, without sending files back and forth. There are features like smart trimming, automatic color grading, and adding music or voiceovers. The first edit is fast, so users only need to make small changes after. Cardboard is backed by Y Combinator, already used by some tech companies, and costs $60 per month with a free trial.

In the comments, people are interested to see how well the AI works for real editing tasks. Some think $60 a month is expensive compared to other video editors, but others say if it saves enough time, it could be worth it for professionals. Some users wonder if the AI makes mistakes, or if users still need to check every detail. The search-by-content feature is popular, and live collaboration gets some praise as well. A few users want to know if Cardboard supports all video formats and large projects. Some prefer editing by hand for more control. There are mixed feelings about AI editing: some think it is the future, while others worry it could hurt creative jobs. Most users are curious and want to see more real-world examples, and maybe a lower price for small creators.

Our next story is about “vibe coding,” a trend where people use AI to quickly build software. The article compares this to the Maker Movement, which was about building things for fun and learning, not just for profit. The Maker Movement promised big changes, but mostly only made prototyping easier. Vibe coding is different because it started with AI tools aimed at serious projects right away, skipping the playful phase. The article argues that vibe coding is more like consuming extra “brainpower” from AI than true craft. This can help people learn and connect, but also makes it easy to feel busy without clear results. The fast pace can lead to burnout if people expect deep personal growth, like with older crafts.

Hacker News users have mixed views. Some agree that vibe coding could end like the Maker Movement, with lots of excitement but little real change. Others think AI tools are strong enough to make a real difference, even if early projects are simple. Some worry that skipping the basics means people won’t understand what they build, while others see value in quick demos and sharing simple projects. Many agree that AI is changing how we build things, but it’s not clear if it will help people grow or just help companies collect more data. Some hope vibe coding will still lead to new ideas and communities.

Now, we have a study about Claude Code, an AI coding assistant. Researchers tested which tools Claude Code chooses when asked to solve real programming problems—over 2,400 prompts in total. They found that Claude often writes custom solutions instead of using popular third-party tools. For example, it writes its own config system for feature flags, or its own code for authentication, instead of using well-known libraries. This “build, not buy” approach is common in most tool categories. When Claude does pick a tool, it usually goes for popular ones, like GitHub Actions, Stripe, or Sentry, and mostly in the JavaScript world. Claude also prefers newer tools, and its choices change as new versions are released. For deployment, it often picks Vercel for JavaScript and Railway for Python, rarely mentioning AWS or Azure.

In the comments, people discuss why Claude builds its own solutions so often. Some think this is risky, because building your own tools can lead to bugs and more work. Others say Claude is being flexible and trying not to add extra dependencies. Some users notice that Claude’s tool choices may shape what people use in new projects. A few wish the AI would explain its choices better or ask more questions before picking a tool. Some are surprised that cloud providers are rarely picked. Overall, users find the study interesting and want to see how Claude’s choices change as new tools come out.

Let’s switch to something different: a story about baking pies. One person decided to bake a pie every day for a year. At first, they did not know much about baking, but learned new skills over time. Sometimes the pies did not turn out well, but they kept going and learned from mistakes. Baking became a way to relax and feel calm after work. Sharing pies with friends and neighbors helped them make new friends, and soon baking was about community, not just the food. They enjoyed trying new flavors and decorating pies. Baking every day taught them patience and to enjoy simple routines.

In the comments, many people praised the writer for sticking with their goal. Some said they want to try a daily project like this, but worry about time. Others shared their own stories about daily habits, like drawing or coding, and how it made them happier. Some asked about the cost and what to do with so many pies. Many said the story was inspiring and showed how small, daily tasks can make a big change in life.

Let’s move on to a technical update from OsmAnd, a popular offline map app. OsmAnd has made navigation much faster by creating a new routing system called Highway Hierarchy, or HH-Routing. The old algorithm, A*, was flexible but slow for long trips. Other fast algorithms were not fit for OsmAnd, because they needed too much storage and didn’t support custom routes. So OsmAnd designed its own system. The new method divides the map into clusters with a few important “border points.” It uses the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to find these spots, and pre-calculates shortcuts between them. When you ask for a route, OsmAnd finds the best path between border points quickly, then fills in the details within each cluster. This makes routing up to 100 times faster, with only a small increase in map file size.

In the comments, some users are impressed by the technical solution, and happy that OsmAnd still offers deep customization. Others worry about keeping map files in sync across regions, which could be tricky for travelers. Some shared stories about slow routing before, saying the speedup will make the app much more usable. There are questions about how the system handles live changes, and praise for the fallback to the old method for special cases. Developers discuss the use of Ford-Fulkerson and compare OsmAnd’s approach to other routing engines. Many are excited about faster offline navigation and respect the technical work.

Next, we have a story about a new way to use lidar sensors for self-driving cars. Normal lidar picks out the strongest signal from each laser pulse, but this can make mistakes in fog or with shiny objects. The new method uses a transformer neural network to look at many waveforms together and learn from patterns. The researchers trained their model with both real and fake data, including bad weather. Their method improved the accuracy of 3D point clouds and worked at longer distances, even in fog.

In the comments, some people are excited and think this could help self-driving cars in bad weather. Others worry about the computing power needed, since transformers often use a lot of resources. Some are concerned about using neural nets for safety tasks, because they can make strange mistakes. There are questions about the amount of training data needed and if the system runs fast enough on real car hardware. Most readers find the research interesting, but want to see more tests and open data before trusting it for real cars.

Now, let’s look back at the Palm OS User Interface Guidelines from 2003. These guidelines told developers how to design apps for Palm handhelds: keep them simple, fast, and easy to use. Apps should show only the most important features, open quickly, and let users get information in one or two taps. Because Palm devices had small screens and no keyboard, apps should not ask for much data entry. Menus are hidden by default, and battery life is important, so apps should not use power for things like animations. Syncing with a desktop is built-in, and apps should make use of this. The article says not to copy desktop apps, but to design for real user needs on the go.

In the comments, many people feel nostalgic about Palm devices and think the guidelines are still useful today. Some say Palm’s focus on simplicity and battery life made it successful, compared to early Windows handhelds. Others wish modern apps would follow these old rules, like fewer taps and less clutter. Some note that simple design is hard, but very important. There is praise for Palm’s syncing and categories, and some say reading the guidelines helps them focus on real user needs.

Our next story is about a digital museum of plugs and sockets from around the world. The museum’s website shows photos and details of many different plugs and sockets, run by a collector named Oof Oud. The site is simple: no cookies or passwords, just information. There is a section for donors, and the site is careful to say it is not a shop. Updates have stopped for now because of the collector’s health, and the future of the site will be decided next year. There is a warning that the site’s information is not a manual, and users should ask experts before using any plug.

In the comments, many users say they enjoy the website and find it interesting. Some share stories about confusing plugs while traveling, or using adapters. People like the simple design and fast loading. Some wish there was only one standard for plugs, but others say the variety shows history. A few users worry about the future of the museum, and some offer help to keep it running. Many thank the collector for their work and share links to similar sites. There are also comments about safety and the idea of visiting a real museum like this.

Finally, we have a new project called “deff.” It is a terminal tool to review git diffs side-by-side, written in Rust. Deff shows added and removed lines with color, highlights code syntax, and lets you move with Vim keys or the mouse. You can search for text, mark files as reviewed, and choose dark or light themes. It is open source, easy to install if you have cargo, and works with both committed and uncommitted changes.

In the comments, people are happy to see a terminal diff tool with side-by-side view. Some compare deff to “delta,” “diff-so-fancy,” or “vimdiff.” Users like the Vim-style navigation and marking files as reviewed. Some ask about support for big diffs, binary files, or Windows. There are suggestions for more themes and better language support. Most comments are positive, and many are excited to try deff in their daily work.

That’s all for today’s episode. Thank you for listening to Hacker News Daily Podcast. We hope these stories help you stay updated and inspired. See you next time!
