The article talks about Coolify, a tool that helps you put your apps online by yourself. It is open-source, which means anyone can see and change the code. You can use it instead of services like Heroku, Netlify, or Vercel.

Coolify works with many programming languages and lets you put your app on any server, like a Raspberry Pi or a cloud service. It helps manage backups, SSL certificates, and can work with Git to update your apps easily. Coolify is self-hostable, meaning you have full control and can stop using it anytime without losing your data.

In the comments, some people say Coolify is hard to use and has problems, like not supporting SSL for database connections or zero downtime when updating apps. They prefer using other tools like Kamal or Dokku, which they find easier and more reliable. Others have positive experiences and say Coolify is easy to use and helps them manage their apps with less work. Some users like that Coolify lets them keep their system simple and not depend on many tools. Others appreciate the community support and low cost compared to cloud services.

Some people also discuss different tools that do similar things, comparing how easy or hard they are to use. They mention alternatives like CapRover, Dokploy, and others for managing app deployments. A few comments talk about the challenges of running a PaaS (Platform as a Service) business and how the market is changing. They note that open-source projects like Coolify are important because they offer freedom from big tech company lock-ins.

AT&T will stop the email-to-text and text-to-email service on June 17, 2025. This means you cannot use email to send or receive text messages anymore.

The main points are: 
1. Email-to-text lets you send an email that shows up as a text on a phone.

Another user says SMS is simple and works well for quick messages without needing to open an app. Some people think SMS is old and not needed because internet apps can do the same job better. Others share tools or services like Pushover and Twilio that can replace the email-to-text service.

## Trump's Tariff Formula Makes No Economic Sense. It's Also Based on an Error

- 原文链接: [Trump's Tariff Formula Makes No Economic Sense. It's Also Based on an Error](https://www.aei.org/economics/president-trumps-tariff-formula-makes-no-economic-sense-its-also-based-on-an-error/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43590421)

The article talks about President Trump's new tariffs, which are extra taxes on goods from other countries. The article says these tariffs are based on a bad formula and don't make sense economically. The stock market is going down, and more people think a recession, which is when the economy gets worse, is coming.

The main points are that Trump says the tariffs are fair and based on what other countries charge the US. But the formula he uses is wrong. It calculates the tariffs based on the difference between what the US buys and sells with another country. Even if the US has a good trade balance with a country, there is still a minimum tariff. The formula is incorrect because it uses wrong numbers to calculate how much other countries' tariffs affect prices. Correcting the mistake would make the tariffs much lower.

People in the comments have different opinions. Some say the formula doesn't make sense and could lead to strange results, like very high tariffs where they shouldn't be. Others think the tariffs are a negotiation tactic to reduce US debt or to protect American jobs. Some believe the tariffs are not really about helping the US but might be for Trump's personal gain. Others worry about the impact on small countries like Lesotho, where many people could lose their jobs because of the tariffs. Some people think the tariffs are part of a bigger political game and may not really help the economy. Overall, many commenters are critical of the tariffs and question the reasons behind them.

In the comments, one person shares a link to see these 3D objects online. Another person says some images are easy to download, but turning them into 3D models is not. Someone else asks if the original CT scans are available for sharing. Some comments suggest the scans are in different places, but the most complete is on a site called Morphosource. People are excited but also wish the process to use these scans was easier.

Others say that rich and powerful people often avoid punishment, and this is a big problem. Some people believe that the loss of law and order can lead to bad things, like in history. Others joke about how money and power can make rules disappear. Overall, the comments show a mix of worry, criticism, and some support for the strict measures in El Salvador.

- 原文链接: [Increasing Timber Production, an Emergency Situation on National Forest Lands [pdf]](https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/sm-1078-006.pdf)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43589321)

The article talks about a new plan to increase timber production in U.S. forests. It says this is an emergency because of wildfires and other problems.

The plan wants to use more U.S. timber and less from other countries. It aims to create jobs and help the economy. The plan also wants to manage forests to stop wildfires, help wildlife, and save money on building and energy. The U.S. Forest Service will do many actions, like removing dead trees and planting new ones, to make forests healthier and safer.

People in the comments have mixed feelings. Some think this is just an excuse to bypass laws and harm the environment. Others believe it's about reducing dependence on Canadian timber and improving the U.S. economy. Some say logging does not solve fire risks and can harm ecosystems. There is also a discussion about the quality of jobs and whether this plan creates good jobs. A few think sustainable forestry is important and can be done with good government rules. Some commenters are skeptical and see this as a way to avoid proper procedures in emergencies.
