Hello everyone, this is the 2026-02-22 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we bring you a wide range of stories from the tech world, from open source tools and new platforms to deep discussions on the future of work and social networks. Let’s get started.

First, we look at Joel’s custom e-paper dashboard project, called Timeframe. Joel wanted a way to display calendar, weather, and smart home data at home, but without adding bright screens. His first attempt was a Magic Mirror using an LCD, but it was too bright and hard to read in sunlight. He then tried hacking Kindle e-readers as e-paper displays. These worked but were slow and needed a lot of maintenance. Later, he switched to Visionect e-paper screens, which could run for months on one charge and worked much better. He put these screens in different rooms like the kitchen and bedroom. The software ran on a Raspberry Pi using Ruby on Rails.

Friends liked the dashboard, but the hardware was too expensive—over $1,000 for a big screen—and new fees made it hard to sell this as a product. After a fire destroyed his house, Joel rebuilt with a new, larger Boox e-paper display. This new screen updated in real time and could show even more information, like music from Sonos and live weather. Joel rewrote his backend to be faster and simpler, moving most of the logic into Home Assistant. Now, the dashboard shows only important messages, like if a door is open or laundry is done. If the screen is blank, it means everything is fine at home.

Joel says the project is not ready for most people yet, as the hardware is still expensive and setup is not easy. He wants to make it easier and more reliable, and finish moving all data into Home Assistant so others can use it as an app.

In the comments, people love the idea and say it looks beautiful and useful. Some wish it was easier and cheaper to buy. Others share their own projects, using old Kindles or digital photo frames as dashboards. Many agree that e-paper is perfect for home displays, as it uses little power and is not bright at night. Some ask about privacy, and Joel replies that all data stays local. Price is a big problem, and many hope costs will drop in the future. People also suggest adding features like task lists, but warn against making it too crowded. Several listeners say they feel inspired to build something like this for their own families.

Next, we talk about Loops, a new open-source, federated platform for sharing short videos, similar to TikTok but without ads or corporate control. Loops lets users own their content, set their own rules, and connect with others across the “fediverse”—a network of independent social platforms. Main features include vertical video feeds, two main feeds for following and discovery, and no tricks to keep you scrolling. It works in browsers and on mobile apps, using ActivityPub, the same protocol as Mastodon and Pixelfed. The camera is simple, lets you add captions, and post quickly. You can like, share, or “boost” videos, and hashtags and search help you find what you care about. Notifications are under your control, and the whole project is open-source and focused on privacy. There are no ads and no data mining.

The people behind Loops say their goal is to give power back to users and creators, not advertisers. The project asks for donations to keep going, since it does not make money from ads.

In the comments, some people are excited to have an open-source TikTok alternative and like the focus on privacy. Others wonder if there will be enough good content and creators, and if federated video sharing will work well since video files are large. Some ask about moderation and how Loops will deal with spam or harmful content. Others point out that most people use platforms where their friends are, so Loops may have trouble growing. But many hope it can fill a need for people who want more control and less tracking. Some say they will try it out or share it with friends. There is strong interest in how Loops will connect with other fediverse apps, and if this can help smaller creators grow. Overall, the comments show excitement but also questions about real-world use.

Now, let’s talk about a possible future called the “Global Intelligence Crisis.” This story imagines what could happen if AI keeps getting much better, very quickly. In 2026, companies used AI to do more work with fewer people, profits grew, and companies kept investing in AI. But soon, many white-collar workers lost their jobs and had to take lower-paid work. As more people lost jobs, they spent less, which hurt other companies. This created a loop: companies saved money by firing people, then spent more on AI and fired even more.

AI also changed how we buy things. Smart AI agents made shopping decisions for people, always looking for the best price. This hurt companies that depended on brand loyalty or habits. Even payment systems like credit cards were affected, with AIs finding ways to avoid fees.

The article explains that this time, job losses are different. In the past, new tech killed some jobs but created new ones for humans. With advanced AI, many new jobs go to machines, not people. Incomes for white-collar workers fall, and spending drops, hurting the economy. Big problems also appear in finance, as more people lose jobs and cannot pay debts. House prices fall in tech-heavy cities, and banks face trouble.

Government tries to help, but tax income drops and common tools do not work well. There are talks of new policies, like basic income or taxing AI, but action is slow.

In the comments, many agree AI could cause huge job losses, but some think the article is too negative. Some say new jobs will appear, while others think AI can do nearly any white-collar job. There is debate about government help, basic income, and the risk of rising inequality. Some are hopeful humans will adapt, but most agree that the changes could be fast and hard for many people.

Let’s turn to social networks. One article explains how social platforms have changed over time. Early networks like Twitter and Facebook were about keeping up with friends. Notifications were real, and the platforms felt hopeful. But after 2012, things changed. The “infinite scroll” made pages never-ending, notifications became less meaningful, and platforms tried to keep people looking at things that did not matter. The feed filled up with posts from strangers. Social networks turned into “attention media,” built to grab and sell your attention.

The writer left these platforms and found Mastodon, a newer platform that feels like the early days. On Mastodon, you only see posts from people you follow, and there are no tricks. The writer hopes Mastodon and similar platforms can keep this true social feeling.

Many comments agree, saying big social networks now feel like TV channels, just trying to keep you watching. Some say they miss the older internet and like that Mastodon is more personal. Others warn that even new platforms can change when they get too popular. Overall, there is a lot of frustration with the current state of social media and hope that smaller, user-focused platforms can do better.

Next, we look at Shuru, a tool for running lightweight Linux virtual machines on macOS. Shuru is made for running AI agents and code safely on your own computer. It uses Apple’s Virtualization framework, so it works fast on Apple Silicon Macs and doesn’t need Docker. You can start a new VM with one command, and by default each VM is “ephemeral”—nothing lasts unless you save a “checkpoint.” You can also branch from a checkpoint if you want to try something new. Networking is off by default for safety, but you can turn it on. The command-line interface is simple, and you can expose services from the VM to your Mac with port forwarding.

People in the comments are excited about secure, throwaway environments without Docker. They like that it uses Apple’s own tools, so it’s faster and easier to set up. Many are glad it’s open-source and written in Rust. Some ask how it’s different from Lima or Colima, and others wish it supported Windows or Intel Macs. Many say “ephemeral by default” is great for reproducibility, and the checkpoint feature is easier than managing Docker images. Overall, the tool gets a warm welcome, and many developers want to try it for safe, fast Linux testing on their Macs.

Another story is about debugging a bug in an open source library. The author tried to use a debugger, but it did not stop at the breakpoint. At first, the author ignored the debugger and tried other ways, like adding log statements, but nothing worked. Later, he realized the problem was the debugger tool itself, not the code. Fixing the debugger was just a simple one-line change, and then fixing the real bug was quick. The lesson is clear: fix your broken tools before trying to fix the code.

Many readers agree, saying it’s easy to forget about tool problems and focus only on code. Some share stories where fixing tools saved them time. Others warn that sometimes fixing tools can take a lot of time, so you should balance your effort. Many say checking your tools first is now a habit. Overall, the message is simple: good tools save time and trouble.

Now, let’s talk about Terence Tao’s new book, “Six Math Essentials.” The book explains six main ideas in math: numbers, algebra, geometry, probability, analysis, and dynamics. Tao says the book is for a general audience—you don’t need a math degree to enjoy it. It will be published in several countries, but dates may vary.

Some readers ask for more details about the book and if there will be sample pages. Others are excited and say they hope to read it soon. One asks why logic was not included, and Tao shares a link to a discussion on the topic. There is a friendly debate about what is truly “essential” in math, and some readers want to see logic or other topics included. Others are curious if Tao will publish more books, including ones based on his lecture notes. Overall, people are looking forward to the book and want to know more.

Moving on, we have a story about using Linux software on FreeBSD with a tool called Linuxulator. The writer wanted to use Visual Studio Code on FreeBSD with ARM64 support and good remote development. Usual remote editing methods were very slow. He tried the VS Code Remote SSH extension, which works on Linux and macOS, but is not supported on OpenWRT or FreeBSD. Surprisingly, it worked on OpenWRT, so he tried it on FreeBSD. At first, it failed, but he found a guide on GitHub about Linuxulator, a FreeBSD feature that lets you run Linux programs. After a simple setup, his VS Code remote session on FreeBSD worked perfectly. He was impressed by how stable and reliable Linuxulator is.

In the comments, people praise Linuxulator for letting them run Linux apps on FreeBSD. Some say setup can be tricky for beginners, but with guides, it’s easier now. Many like that FreeBSD supports Linux software, making it flexible for developers. A few mention rare bugs or missing features, and some warn it may not work for more complex apps like Docker. Others hope for more ARM64 support in the future. Many agree that Linuxulator is a good example of strong engineering and helps people try FreeBSD.

Next, we look at Worg, a big collection of guides and notes made by fans of Org-mode. Org-mode is a tool for keeping your life and work organized using plain text files in Emacs. You can use it for tasks, notes, calendars, and even writing web pages. Worg is part of the Org-mode website, sharing tutorials, code, and advice. There are guides for beginners and advanced users, plus tips for customizing Org-mode. Worg also connects you to the community through FAQs, mailing lists, and chat channels.

In the comments, people praise Org-mode’s power and flexibility. Some say it changed how they work and plan their days. Others mention the steep learning curve, but say Worg helps a lot. Some wish Org-mode worked outside Emacs or was easier to set up on mobile. There is debate about using plain text versus apps with nicer interfaces. Many highlight the value of free software and the community behind Org-mode. Some suggest more video guides or simpler introductions to help new users.

Finally, we have Second Track, a new website to help you discover music records you might like. You can search by mood, artist, or tell the site what you love, and it will suggest albums. There are “crates” of five records around a theme, and you can import your Discogs library for personal recommendations. The site offers guides to new genres and “listening guides” to help you explore music connections. You can also track record prices and get alerts when they drop. Each week, you get handpicked record suggestions by email, not just algorithm picks.

In the comments, people like the idea of using mood or taste to find music, saying it feels more human than most algorithm-based services. Some appreciate the focus on vinyl and real records, not just streaming. Others wonder how good the AI recommendations are and if the site will help them find new or rare music. Some want more features, like better search or integration with other music tools. There are questions about long-term success, but many agree it’s fun to see more projects that help people discover music in different ways.
