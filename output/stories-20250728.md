## I designed my own fast game streaming video codec – PyroWave

- 原文链接: [I designed my own fast game streaming video codec – PyroWave](https://themaister.net/blog/2025/06/16/i-designed-my-own-ridiculously-fast-game-streaming-video-codec-pyrowave/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44714914)

This article is about building a new, very fast video codec called PyroWave for game streaming. The author wanted to make game video streaming faster and with less delay between machines on a local network.

The main idea is to cut latency at every step—by making encoding and decoding video frames as quick as possible. Most people use common codecs like H.264 or HEVC, but these are slow because they do smart tricks that need time, like motion prediction and entropy coding. For local streaming, where there’s lots of bandwidth, the author decided to throw away these tricks. Instead, PyroWave is “intra-only” (no motion prediction), which makes the data bigger but more robust and simple. The codec also skips entropy coding, making it much easier to run on GPUs in parallel. PyroWave uses a Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), which is a way to break images into different detail levels, kind of like making mipmaps in graphics. After that, it quickly quantizes and packs the data into blocks for easy and fast processing on GPUs.

The author describes the technical details: using 32x32 blocks, breaking them down for GPU threads, and using bit-plane encoding without fancy compression. This keeps things fast and easy to decode, even if some data gets lost—it just makes a small blurry spot in the video. Rate control (making sure each frame is the right size) is simple since there’s no entropy coding: the codec just drops less-important bits until the frame fits the size target. The result is encoding and decoding so fast that it’s done in milliseconds, much quicker than regular GPU hardware encoders. For quality, PyroWave looks almost as good as other codecs at very high bitrates, even for hard-to-compress games, and uses little power.

The article ends with test results: PyroWave can encode and decode 1080p or 4K video in less than a millisecond, and quality is good enough that most people won’t see a difference at high bitrates. The author is happy with this “do it yourself” solution.

Commenters on Hacker News have mixed feelings. Some are impressed by the speed and clever use of wavelets and GPU parallelism. Others note that the very high bandwidth use makes PyroWave unsuitable for internet streaming, but good for local network gaming. A few commenters worry about the lack of motion prediction, saying it wastes bandwidth, but agree that for zero-latency streaming, it's a fair trade-off. Some people point out that skipping entropy coding is rare and interesting, and they like the practical focus on local use. Others share similar projects from video engineering or mention applications in remote desktop and cloud gaming. There is praise for the clear explanations and open-source code, but some ask about how PyroWave would handle situations with less bandwidth or over the internet. A few users discuss potential quality issues from using FP16 math and wavelet artifacts, but think it’s not a big problem for games with blurry graphics. Overall, the community likes the DIY spirit and thinks PyroWave is a fun and useful experiment for fast, local game streaming.

## Sign in with Google in Chrome

- 原文链接: [Sign in with Google in Chrome](https://underpassapp.com/news/2025/7/5.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44715166)

This article talks about how some websites, like Yelp, show a “Sign in with Google” banner, but you do not see this banner if you use Google Chrome. The author explains that this is because Google calls this feature the “One Tap user experience.” If you use browsers like Safari or Firefox, you often see these banners. But in Chrome, the banners are hidden by default.

The author runs a web browser extension called StopTheMadness Pro, which can hide these banners in browsers that show them, like Safari and Firefox. The article explains how you can test this by changing Safari’s user agent to Chrome, which makes the banners disappear. This shows that websites check the browser and only show the banners in some browsers.

In Chrome, though, there is a different kind of “Sign in with Google” prompt. This prompt is not part of the website, but rather built into Chrome itself. It appears as a dialog from Chrome (not from the web page), and Chrome extensions cannot remove it or even show their popup windows when this prompt is on the screen. This is not a bug in the StopTheMadness extension; it is how Chrome works.

The author also gives a tip: you can disable this Chrome dialog by going to a special settings page (`chrome://settings/content/federatedIdentityApi`) and choosing “Block sign-in prompts from identity services.” This will stop the dialogs from showing up in Chrome.

Finally, the author says that this is an example of Google giving its own browser special treatment compared to others, which could be a concern for courts and regulators.

In the comments, some people agree and say that Google gives Chrome an unfair advantage by hiding annoyances in their own browser while showing them in others. Others think it is smart business for Google to make Chrome smoother, and that every browser maker does this kind of thing. A few users share that they find the Chrome dialog even more annoying because it is harder to block or hide. Some people say they use tools or browser extensions to avoid these dialogs in non-Chrome browsers, but wish there were better options in Chrome itself.

One commenter says web standards should stop browsers from acting differently on the same websites, because it is confusing for users. Another person points out that Chrome’s setting to block these dialogs is hard to discover, and Google should make it easier to find. A few developers talk about how the website code checks for the Chrome browser and changes what it shows, which they think is not good for the open web.

Some people ask if other browsers will copy this behavior to make their users happier, while others say they prefer browsers that do not do special tricks. There is also a discussion about privacy, with a few users saying that these sign-in dialogs collect too much data and should be opt-in only. Overall, readers have mixed feelings, but most agree it is strange that Chrome and other browsers act so differently on the same websites.

## Show HN: Use Their ID – Use Your Local UK MP's ID for the Online Safety Act

- 原文链接: [Show HN: Use Their ID – Use Your Local UK MP's ID for the Online Safety Act](https://use-their-id.com/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44716106)

This article talks about a website called "Use Their ID." The website lets people see what a UK Member of Parliament’s (MP’s) driving license might look like, based on a postcode. The reason for this is the new UK Online Safety Act, which may require people to show ID to use some online services. The creator wants to show how strange or risky this idea can be.

The website asks for your postcode, then finds your local MP and shows a fake driving license with their details. The point is to make people think: if everyone must show ID for the internet, what stops someone from using someone else’s details? The site is not for stealing real data—it’s just to make a statement.

The article suggests that ID checks could make privacy worse. It shows how easy it might be to get public information about MPs and use it for ID purposes. This could happen to normal people, too, if ID checks become common. People could copy or fake IDs, leading to fraud or privacy risks. The author thinks the Online Safety Act could have many bad side effects.

Top comments on Hacker News have mixed views. Some people say the tool is clever and makes a good point about privacy. They worry that forcing ID checks will hurt anonymous speech online. Others talk about how public data can be misused, and that laws like these may not actually stop crime or abuse.

A few commenters say the tool is just a joke, but they agree it shows a real risk. Some think the UK government doesn’t understand how easy it is to get around ID checks. Others ask if this kind of protest will really change anything, or if lawmakers will just ignore it. Some even warn that showing fake IDs, even as a protest, might get the website in trouble.

Many agree that privacy and security are important, and that these laws may do more harm than good. People share worries about losing privacy, about identity theft, and about chilling free speech. But a few still hope that with enough protest, the law could be changed or improved.

## Tao on “blue team” vs. “red team” LLMs

- 原文链接: [Tao on “blue team” vs. “red team” LLMs](https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/114915604830689046)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44711306)

The article talks about the “blue team” and “red team” roles, first in cybersecurity, then in other fields like software engineering and mathematics. Blue teams build things—like systems, code, or proofs—while red teams try to find problems or errors in what the blue team makes.

The author, Terence Tao, explains that blue teams are needed to create something useful, but red teams are just as important because they find weak spots that could cause big problems. A blue team’s work is only as strong as its weakest point. For example, a strong door and an open window make a house insecure. Red teams, on the other hand, help by pointing out all the problems, even small ones, because each issue found is useful to fix.

He says that even people who make mistakes can be helpful on red teams if their work adds to what reliable team members do, and if someone can sort out what is useful. Tao points out that these ideas show up everywhere. In software, the blue team writes code and the red team tests it. In math, some people suggest new ideas (optimists/blue team), while others check for mistakes or flaws (pessimists/red team). Good teams mix both kinds of people.

Tao believes that many AI tools today are used as blue team helpers—making code, text, or images. But since AI is often unreliable, it might be more useful as a red team tool, checking and critiquing the work of humans rather than making things on its own. He shares that when he uses AI to review his own work, he only agrees with some of its suggestions, but those can be helpful. He thinks this “red team” use for AI is safer and more reliable.

In the comments, many people agree that AI works better for checking work than for creating it. One person from a big newspaper says they use AI this way and it helps. Some say LLMs (language models) are like talking to yourself in a mirror—useful for reflection but not for making new things. Others joke that talking to a dog or a student about your ideas is just as helpful, maybe more natural.

People notice that AI tools are often designed to be positive and friendly (blue team style), but for red team work, they need to be more critical or “pessimistic.” One user shares a story where an AI changed its answer quickly to agree with the user, even when the user was wrong, showing that current AIs can be too eager to please.

Some think that both blue and red teams need a mix of confidence and openness to being wrong. Others say that in real life, teams often do both jobs at once, not just one.

There is also discussion about logic: some researchers are looking at ways to combine “proof” (blue team) and “refutation” (red team) in formal systems, which might help with AI safety. Some people say that the “red team/blue team” way of talking is new, and in the past, hackers just did both jobs alone.

A few people reflect that the best teams have a good balance of optimistic builders and careful checkers. This balance helps catch mistakes and leads to stronger results. Overall, most agree that AI is best used as a helper to find errors, not as a creator to replace humans.

## Different Clocks

- 原文链接: [Different Clocks](https://ianto-cannon.github.io/clock.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44714223)

The article shows a web page with different types of clocks, all made using JavaScript and SVG graphics. Each clock is a creative way to show time, not like a normal clock.

One clock is called "Binary." It uses squares to show Unix time. Unix time counts the number of seconds since the year 1970. The number is shown in binary, using 32 squares.

Another clock is called "Polygons." This clock uses shapes with sides for months, weeks, and days. For example, if it is January, there is an empty polygon, and if it is December, the polygon is full. It also shows the week in the month and the day of the week.

There is a "Blobs" clock. The left blob moves slowly and takes 1,000 years to finish one cycle. Other blobs move faster: one finishes in a year, one in a day, one in an hour, one in a minute, and one in a second. The last blob mixes all these waves together.

The "Peaks" clock uses sharp peaks. The tallest peak moves once every 1,000 years. Other peaks move once per year, day, hour, and minute.

"Waves" is another clock. It looks like Peaks, but instead of sharp edges, it uses smooth curves called Bézier curves.

All clocks show the current UTC time in different, artistic ways. The source code is open for anyone to use or change.

Commenters liked how these clocks look and how different they are from normal clocks. Some people said the clocks are fun and could be used as art. Others pointed out that reading the exact time is hard with these clocks, but that is not always the point—the designs help you think about time in new ways.

A few users talked about how the binary clock could help people learn about Unix time and binary numbers. Some liked the polygons for showing many parts of the date at once.

One commenter wondered if these clocks would be helpful for people who like to see time as patterns instead of numbers. Someone else said the blobs and waves are calming to watch.

There were also ideas for making the clocks better, like adding color or making the shapes easier to read. A few people shared links to other creative clocks they had seen.

Some users said they might want to use these clocks on their own websites. Others just enjoyed looking at something new and creative.

Overall, the comments showed that people enjoy seeing time in different ways, even if it is not always practical. Many liked the open-source code and wanted to try making their own versions.

## The Useless UseCallback

- 原文链接: [The Useless UseCallback](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/the-useless-use-callback)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44715391)

This article talks about the React hooks `useCallback` and `useMemo`, and when using them does not actually help your app. The writer says people often use these hooks to make things faster or to stop effects from running too much. But in many cases, using them adds no real value and just makes the code more complex.

The main reason for using `useCallback` or `useMemo` is to keep the same function or value between renders. This is called "referential stability." It can help React skip rendering parts of your UI, but only if you use it the right way. If you use these hooks for functions passed to normal components (not memoized ones), it does nothing. For example, wrapping a button's click handler in `useCallback` doesn't help because the button doesn't care if the function changes.

The article shows code where memoizing is useless, like when you use `useCallback` for props going to normal components or React built-in components. Another problem comes when you use props as dependencies in your own `useCallback`. If the parent sends a new function or object every time, your memoization breaks, but you might not even notice.

There is a real example from the Sentry codebase. It shows how memoization can break easily: a value is memoized, but it depends on another value that is not memoized, so the memoization is wasted. This chain of dependencies is hard to follow and makes the code harder to change.

The writer suggests a better pattern: use a ref to always keep the latest value, and update it with an effect on every render. This avoids the need for deep memoization. Also, a new React hook, `useEffectEvent`, will help solve this problem in the future.

In the comments, many people agree that `useCallback` and `useMemo` are often overused. Some say they only use these hooks when they see a real performance problem. Others share that they add these hooks only after profiling and finding actual slowdowns. A few think the React docs or examples make people think they should use these hooks everywhere, which leads to confusion.

Others point out that memoization can make debugging and reading code harder. Some share stories where removing `useCallback` made their apps simpler without any loss in speed. There are also comments saying that sometimes, big teams add these hooks because they are told to, not because it helps.

One commenter warns that using refs to keep the latest value might hide bugs or make code less clear for beginners. Another person is excited about `useEffectEvent` and hopes it will make these patterns easier. A few discuss how React's coming compiler might fix many of these problems in the future.

In the end, most people agree: only use memoization when you really need it, not just because you can. Simple code is often better and less confusing.

## The Vatican Observatory Looks to the Heavens

- 原文链接: [The Vatican Observatory Looks to the Heavens](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/08/04/the-vatican-observatory-looks-to-the-heavens)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44715966)

The article is about the Vatican Observatory, which is a science center run by the Catholic Church near Rome. It focuses on Guy Consolmagno, the director, who is known as the Pope’s Astronomer and is an expert in meteorites. The observatory has existed since 1891 and is located at Castel Gandolfo, the former summer home of the Pope. The Vatican Observatory studies the stars, planets, and other objects in space. Consolmagno is originally from Michigan and is a Jesuit, which means he is both a scientist and a priest. The observatory collects meteorites and uses telescopes to do research. It tries to show that science and faith can work together. Consolmagno believes that exploring the universe can be a way to connect with something bigger, and he says even non-religious scientists feel a sense of wonder. The observatory staff includes people from many countries, and they work with other space scientists around the world. The Vatican Observatory also teaches students and helps train the next generation of astronomers. 

In the Hacker News comments, some people are surprised that the Vatican has its own observatory and does real science. Others share stories about meeting Vatican astronomers or visiting the site. A few users talk about the long history of the Catholic Church supporting science, while some mention times when the Church and scientists have disagreed. There are comments about how science and religion can both inspire wonder, but not everyone agrees on how closely they should mix. Some users respect Consolmagno for his work and open mind. Others are critical, saying that faith-based organizations should not guide science. There is also interest in the observatory’s meteorite collection and its value to science. Some users say they would like to see more stories about scientists who are also religious. A few people discuss if the Vatican’s support for astronomy is mostly symbolic or if it has real impact. Many agree that the universe is beautiful and mysterious, no matter what you believe.

## Interstellar Comet 3I/Atlas: What We Know Now

- 原文链接: [Interstellar Comet 3I/Atlas: What We Know Now](https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-news/interstellar-comet-3i-atlas-what-we-know-now/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44713579)

A new comet called 3I/Atlas has entered our solar system from another star. Scientists are studying it to learn more about objects that travel between stars.

This comet is the third known interstellar object, after ‘Oumuamua and Borisov. 3I/Atlas is moving very fast and has a path that shows it is not from our solar system. Its speed and direction tell us it came from far away. Scientists have used big telescopes to watch the comet as it gets closer. They look at its light to find out what it is made of. Early data shows that 3I/Atlas has some of the same materials as comets from our solar system, like ice and dust. But there are also some small differences. Its shape, size, and how it shines change as it travels. This helps scientists compare it with other comets. Studying 3I/Atlas may help answer questions about how comets form around other stars. It also helps us understand if objects like this are common or rare in space.

People on Hacker News are excited about another interstellar visitor. Some users wonder if we can send a spacecraft to study it up close, but most say it is too fast and too far. Others talk about how hard it is to spot these objects because they move quickly and appear suddenly. There are also comments about what we can learn from their makeup—maybe even clues about life in other systems. A few people are surprised that interstellar objects are being found more often now. Some think this is because our telescopes and computers are better than before. Others ask if these comets could hit Earth, but most agree the chances are very low. One person hopes in the future we can catch one and study it directly. Another points out how discoveries like this make astronomy exciting.
