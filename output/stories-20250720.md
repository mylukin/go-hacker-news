## Staying cool without refrigerants: Next-generation Peltier cooling

- 原文链接: [Staying cool without refrigerants: Next-generation Peltier cooling](https://news.samsung.com/global/interview-staying-cool-without-refrigerants-how-samsung-is-pioneering-next-generation-peltier-cooling)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44628930)

Samsung and Johns Hopkins made a new cooling device using Peltier technology, which does not need normal refrigerants. This device uses thin-film semiconductors and can cool things without harming the environment. Usually, fridges use gas and compressors, but these parts are big and use chemicals that can be bad for the air. The new Peltier device works by using electricity to move heat, making one side cold and the other side hot.

This Peltier method is simpler, easier to control, and could help design smaller, smarter fridges. In 2024, Samsung released a hybrid fridge that uses both a compressor and Peltier cooling. The compressor works for normal cooling, but when you add lots of groceries or hot food, the Peltier device switches on to help cool faster. The Peltier part also helps keep the temperature stable when the fridge defrosts.

To make Peltier devices work well, Samsung and Johns Hopkins had to solve problems with heat transfer and make sure both sides of the device stayed at the right temperature. They created new materials and ways to put the device together. This made the Peltier device about 75% more efficient than before. The result is a fridge that uses up to 30% less power than top-rated models in Korea.

Samsung wants to bring this technology to more places, even hot and humid countries. Their long-term goal is to make fridges that use only Peltier cooling, with no harmful refrigerants at all. They hope to use AI and 3D printing to make this happen. This could change how fridges are made and help protect the environment.

People commenting on Hacker News had many opinions. Some were excited about fridges without harmful gases and liked the better energy use. Others remembered old Peltier coolers and worried they were not efficient for big jobs. A few thought the tech sounded great for small devices, but maybe not for full-size fridges yet.

Several commenters wanted more details on energy savings and cost. Some pointed out that Peltier devices often make one side very hot, and getting rid of that heat can be tricky. Others wondered how long these devices would last and if repairs would be easy. A few said this could lead to fridges with smarter features and better designs since the parts take up less space.

Some were hopeful this would push other companies to improve their own fridge technology. Others thought the idea was interesting but wanted to see real-world tests before getting too excited. Overall, the comments showed a mix of hope for the future and careful questions about how well Peltier cooling would really work in our homes.

## Stdio(3) change: FILE is now opaque (OpenBSD)

- 原文链接: [Stdio(3) change: FILE is now opaque (OpenBSD)](https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20250717103345)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44627793)

OpenBSD has changed how the FILE type works in its stdio library; now, the internal structure of FILE is hidden (opaque). This is a big change and affects many parts of the system and its libraries.

Before, some programs could look inside the FILE structure and use its details. Now, only the library itself knows what is inside FILE, and user programs cannot see or use the inside parts anymore. The real definition of FILE has been moved to a private header file. If programs try to access or use the old internal parts, they will not compile. For now, some symbols are kept for transition, but they will be removed soon. Many libraries and programs needed updates, and the version numbers of these libraries have gone up because of this change. The article says this will help OpenBSD be safer and easier to maintain in the long run. If you usually build OpenBSD from source, you should use a system snapshot to upgrade, not just rebuild, because so many things have changed.

In the comment section, some people say this is a good thing because hiding the structure makes code safer and more robust. Others point out that many old programs that used FILE internals will now break and need to be fixed. Some developers remember when Linux and other systems made similar changes and had the same problems at first. A few worry that this will make debugging and low-level programming harder. But others reply that this is normal for secure and modern systems, and the benefits are greater than the inconvenience. Some users ask if this will affect cross-platform code and portability, and others note that most standard code should be fine, since only non-standard tricks are now blocked. A few thank the OpenBSD team for doing the hard work of cleaning up so much old code. Some mention that it took a lot of testing and small fixes to get everything working. One person jokes that now, more people will finally read the documentation instead of poking at the internals. Overall, most agree this is a big and positive step for OpenBSD, even if it causes some pain for old code.

## XMLUI

- 原文链接: [XMLUI](https://blog.jonudell.net/2025/07/18/introducing-xmlui/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44625292)

XMLUI is a new tool that helps people build web apps using simple XML-like code, without needing deep knowledge of React or CSS. The article explains how XMLUI tries to bring back the easy, component-based style of Visual Basic from the 1990s, but for modern web development.

With XMLUI, you can make apps by writing short XML code that connects ready-made components. For example, you can build an app to show London tube lines and stations in just a few lines. You add a Select box, load data from an API, and show the results in a Table, all without writing JavaScript or CSS. The tool handles reactivity too—when a user picks a different tube line, the data updates automatically, like how spreadsheets work.

XMLUI has many built-in components like DataSource (to fetch data), APICall, Table, and more. You can also make your own reusable components easily. The system supports themes, so you can change how your app looks without writing CSS. Default themes look good, and you can set colors and roles (like primary, secondary, surface) with simple variables.

If you need to do more, you can add small bits of JavaScript for things like transforming API results. The article notes that while XMLUI is declarative, some scripting is possible, but it stays simple and focused. For people worried about AI code generation, XMLUI works well with LLMs (AI assistants), letting you review and understand what the AI suggests—unlike big React codebases that can be hard to follow.

Another key feature is the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which helps AI assistants answer questions about XMLUI code, patterns, and documentation. This makes it easier to learn and build apps with AI help.

The article also talks about using XMLUI for content management, like making help sites or tutorials. You can mix app code and documentation, and even show live demos inside your docs. If you need a special UI component not included, XMLUI can wrap existing React components—like the Tiptap editor—so you can extend it when needed.

Deploying XMLUI apps is simple; you just need a few files and can host them on any static web server or even an AWS bucket. The tool is made by people who want to make building business UIs as easy as connecting to data or networks.

In the Hacker News comments, many people liked the idea of making UI development simpler and compared XMLUI to old tools like Visual Basic, Delphi, or even Microsoft Access. Some users are excited because they remember how easy those tools made building small business apps and hope XMLUI can bring that back. Others are more cautious, pointing out that past attempts to make declarative UIs (like XAML, Silverlight, or web components) often struggled with real-world complexity or lacked adoption.

A few developers worry about lock-in: since XMLUI is its own system, will you be stuck if it’s not popular in a few years? Some question if the XML-like syntax will scale well for big projects, or if it will become hard to manage as apps grow. There’s also discussion about the need for some scripting—will non-coders get stuck when something needs a custom function?

Some front-end experts argue that React’s complexity is there for a reason: real apps get complicated quickly, and hiding too much can make debugging harder. Others counter that most business apps are simple, and not everyone wants to become a React expert just to build a dashboard or data entry form.

People like the focus on easy theming and less CSS, saying that most devs struggle with design. The integration with AI assistants is seen as smart, since more people use LLMs for coding help now. Some users are curious if XMLUI will work well with existing workflows, or if it’s best for new projects only.

Overall, the discussion shows hope that XMLUI can help more people build useful web apps, but also caution about the challenges of making simple tools that stay flexible and future-proof.

## New colors without shooting lasers into your eyes

- 原文链接: [New colors without shooting lasers into your eyes](https://dynomight.net/colors/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44594808)

This article is about how scientists can make people see new, never-before-seen colors by using lasers to activate single types of color cells in the eye. Usually, our eyes have three types of cones (cells that detect color), but their ranges overlap, so we never see only one type firing at a time.

The article explains that M cones (which sense green) and L cones (which sense red) both respond to similar light, so our brain mixes their signals. But with special lasers, scientists can turn on just one type—like only the M cones. People then report seeing a super-bright, unique blue-green color, different from anything seen before. The study didn’t share many details about what these colors look like, but this discovery caught the writer’s attention.

The article also talks about an optical illusion that lets you see a strange color without lasers. It uses a red circle on a blue-green background; as you stare, your red cones get tired, and you start to see a “new” blue-green color around the circle’s edge. This trick is based on how our eyes and brain work together, and the author suggests that, maybe, you can get some of the same effects as the laser experiment just by using clever images.

The piece then explores color spaces—a way to show all the colors people can see. There’s a triangle diagram showing which combinations of cone activity make up human color vision. Computer screens only use three colors (red, green, blue) and can’t show every color our eyes can detect, especially those “new” colors from the laser trick.

The author made a tool to play with these optical illusions using different color pairs, and invites readers to try it out. There are links to some favorite color mixes and a note for colorblind users, saying results may vary and asking for feedback if they try.

In the comments, some readers are amazed at the idea of seeing a totally new color, and share their own experiences with color illusions. Others say this shows how much of color is about how the brain interprets signals, not just what’s in the world. A few people debate whether optical illusions on screens can really match what lasers do, since screens can’t make pure colors. Some mention color blindness and wonder if similar tricks could help people with vision differences see new shades. There’s discussion about how cone overlap isn’t a “flaw,” but a result of evolution, and some suggest that technology might let us “hack” our senses in the future. Others wish the original study shared more details from the people who saw the new colors. Finally, a few readers try the linked illusion and describe what they saw, with mixed results—some saw intense colors, others didn’t notice much.

## Tough news for our UK users

- 原文链接: [Tough news for our UK users](https://blog.janitorai.com/posts/3/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44629134)

JanitorAI will block all users in the UK because of the new Online Safety Act. The team says they only had four days to tell users, and they are very sorry about the short notice.

The main problem is the UK law is very hard and expensive to follow. The law asks for legal risk checks, ID checks for users, and a lot of legal work. Big companies might be able to do this, but small teams like JanitorAI cannot. The law is long and confusing—over 3,000 pages of rules. If JanitorAI makes a mistake, they could get huge fines or even jail time for the people running the company.

The JanitorAI team tried to find a way to follow the law, but it was not possible for them. They hoped there would be exceptions for small companies, but there are not. So, they have no choice but to block UK users to keep their team safe.

The writer says this is bad for small tech companies. Only big companies can follow these laws, so smaller platforms will stop working in the UK. This could hurt tech innovation there. The team hopes to come back in the future if they can find a way to follow the rules.

From the comments, many people agree the law is too strict and hurts small tech startups. Some say the UK government is making it too hard for new ideas to grow. They worry only big companies will survive. Others comment about the law being unclear and hard to read, which makes it worse for small teams. A few people think the law could help stop bad content online, but most feel it is not fair for everyone.

Some users share that they work at other small tech companies, and they also plan to block UK users. Others say this could lead to more people using VPNs to get around blocks. One person reminds everyone that users will not get in trouble for trying to access JanitorAI; only the company faces risk. A few comments suggest that the law could change if enough people complain, but most are not hopeful. Some worry this is just the start, and more countries might make similar rules. Others feel sad for UK users losing access to new technology. Overall, most people in the comments think this is a bad result for tech and for users in the UK.

## Coding with LLMs in the summer of 2025 – an update

- 原文链接: [Coding with LLMs in the summer of 2025 – an update](https://antirez.com/news/154)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44623953)

This article talks about how coding with large language models (LLMs) like Gemini 2.5 PRO has changed a lot by 2025. The writer explains that LLMs can now help programmers find bugs, test new ideas quickly, design with AI’s deep knowledge, and even work in areas outside their main skills.

The author shares real examples, like using LLMs to find bugs in Redis and to write test code fast. They say LLMs are very good at helping when you clearly describe what you want and work together with them, not just letting the AI do everything alone. For simple projects, you might let the LLM write all the code, but for bigger or more complex work, the best results come from a strong human and AI partnership.

The article warns against “vibe coding,” meaning letting LLMs run wild without much human control. LLMs can make big, messy, or weak code if left alone, so it’s important for humans to guide the process, check AI’s work, and explain clearly what is needed. Giving LLMs a lot of context—like codebase, docs, hints about good or bad solutions—helps them perform better.

The author recommends using the best LLMs directly (Gemini 2.5 PRO or Claude Opus 4) instead of using tools that hide how LLMs work, like coding agents inside editors. You should give LLMs all the info they need and always keep humans “in the loop.” Don’t use tools that only show the LLM part of the code, as this makes their help worse.

For now, the best way to code is human plus LLM, with the human keeping control. The author believes in the future, LLMs may do more alone, but right now, skipping the hype and using AI with care gets the sharpest results. You also learn from LLMs, and you keep a good understanding of your code.

Top Hacker News comments agree that LLMs are very helpful if you know how to use them well. Many say that you still need to check LLM code carefully, as they can make mistakes or use libraries you don’t want. Some users say LLMs are great at speeding up boring or small tasks, like writing tests or boilerplate code.

Other commenters warn not to trust LLMs too much for big projects yet, as their code can have hidden bugs or miss important details. A few people point out that being able to talk clearly to LLMs is a skill by itself, and not everyone has it yet. Some see LLMs as a way to try new technologies or languages without spending lots of time learning everything from scratch.

There are also notes that using LLMs too much can make people lazy or less careful, so it’s important to keep thinking about what the code is doing. Some readers are excited for the future when LLMs will be even better, but others say it’s still easy to spot AI-written code because of its style. A few say that companies should teach devs how to use LLMs well, as it’s becoming a key skill.

Finally, some worry that if you don’t use LLMs now, you might fall behind other developers. Others think coding with LLMs is just another tool, like using Stack Overflow or Google, and it’s up to you to use it wisely.

## Simulating Hand-Drawn Motion with SVG Filters

- 原文链接: [Simulating Hand-Drawn Motion with SVG Filters](https://camillovisini.com/coding/simulating-hand-drawn-motion-with-svg-filters)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44591305)

This article explains how to make computer images look like they move with a hand-drawn, cartoon-style “jitter” effect. The author noticed this effect in a pizza documentary and wanted to recreate it for web images using SVG filters.

The effect is called “boiling” or “line boil.” In old cartoons, artists drew the same picture several times with small differences and then showed them quickly one after another. This made still images look alive, even if nothing big was happening. The author first tried this by drawing the same object a few times and switching between the frames, like a flipbook. But in many modern animations, the movement is done by computers, not by redrawing by hand.

The article shows how to copy this boiling look using SVG filter effects in the browser. The main trick is to distort the edges of shapes with computer-made noise, so they wobble and look less perfect. For this, the author uses two SVG filters: `feTurbulence` (to create noise) and `feDisplacementMap` (to use that noise to move pixels around). When these two work together, the image appears to shake or wiggle like a hand-drawn cartoon.

The code example uses these filters in SVG. At first, the effect is static. To make it move, JavaScript changes some numbers (like how much the noise changes) every few milliseconds. This makes the image edges move and creates the boiling animation. The author also shares demos where you can change the filter settings and see what happens. With a little change, the effect is gentle and fun; with a big change, the image shakes too much and looks strange.

The author’s main point: with only a few lines of SVG and JavaScript, you can turn boring computer images into lively, hand-drawn-looking art.

Hacker News readers liked the article and thought the demos were fun and easy to understand. Some said they remembered this effect from old cartoons and were happy to learn how it works on computers. A few people shared their own ways to make similar effects, like using CSS or other graphics tools. Some readers talked about performance, saying SVG filters can use a lot of computer power, so you should be careful with big images or many moving shapes. Others asked about making the effect work with canvas or other image types, not just SVG. One person pointed out that if you use the effect too much, it can be distracting for users. But most agreed that, in the right amount, this boiling effect makes images and websites look more interesting and friendly.

A few readers wondered about making the effect look even more like real hand-drawn art, maybe by mixing in some color changes or textures. Someone else liked the clear code samples and wanted to try this in their own projects. Overall, people enjoyed learning a simple trick to make web images feel warmer and more human.

## FFmpeg devs boast of another 100x leap thanks to handwritten assembly code

- 原文链接: [FFmpeg devs boast of another 100x leap thanks to handwritten assembly code](https://www.tomshardware.com/software/the-biggest-speedup-ive-seen-so-far-ffmpeg-devs-boast-of-another-100x-leap-thanks-to-handwritten-assembly-code)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44629206)

This article talks about FFmpeg developers making their video software much faster using handwritten assembly code. FFmpeg is a popular tool for handling video and audio files.

The developers rewrote some important parts of FFmpeg by hand, using assembly language instead of a programming language like C. Assembly language is very close to how computers really work, so programs written in assembly can run much faster. In this case, the changes made FFmpeg up to 100 times faster for some tasks. The improvements focused on video encoding and decoding, which are key for streaming, editing, and sharing videos. The article says that automatic tools and compilers could not make code this fast; only careful manual work made it possible. The developers spent a lot of time understanding the details of the CPU and memory to make these changes. They also had to test their code on different computers to be sure it works everywhere. The result is that FFmpeg can now handle very high-quality video much faster and with less computer power. This is good news for people who make videos or run video services, because they can save money on hardware and get better performance. The article also points out that few programmers write assembly today, because it is hard and takes a lot of time. Most use higher-level languages because they are easier to understand and maintain. But sometimes, for important tasks, assembly is still the best choice.

In the comments, some people are really impressed by the speed boost and say it shows how much more is possible with low-level programming. Others point out that assembly code is hard to maintain and can break when computers change. A few worry that not many people know assembly, so this work might be hard to update in the future. Some users think this is proof that current compilers still have a long way to go before they match expert humans for important code. Others remind everyone that for most projects, the extra effort for assembly is not worth it, but for FFmpeg it makes sense. There are also jokes about how some video apps are still slow even with these tools, and some wonder if other software could get similar gains. One person mentions that handwritten assembly was more common in the past, but now it is rare except in special cases like this. Another user says this shows why open source projects are important, because they let experts push the limits for everyone. A few people share stories about their own experiences writing assembly and how rewarding or difficult it can be.

## Subreply – an open source text-only social network

- 原文链接: [Subreply – an open source text-only social network](https://github.com/lucianmarin/subreply)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44628082)

Subreply is an open-source, text-only social network that you can find on GitHub. The project is simple, fast, and meant for people who want a no-frills way to talk online.

The main idea is to give users a small, clean place to post text and reply to others. There are no images, videos, or extra features—just words. You can run Subreply on your own computer by installing the code, setting up a few files, and starting the server. The instructions are short: install the needed Python packages, create a settings file with a security key, and launch the app. The code is made to be easy to read and change. The style guide says there should be no useless code and every request should be very fast, under 50 milliseconds. The project uses modern Python tools and tries to keep everything clear for developers. There are a few folders for things like templates, static files, and main logic. The GitHub page shows regular updates and fixes.

Many people in the comments like the idea of a simple, text-only social network. Some developers say they are tired of big sites with too many features and ads. They enjoy the focus on just reading and writing text. Others point out the value for people who want to control their own data and run their own social site. A few users wonder if Subreply can grow or stay friendly as more people join. Some worry that all social sites face spam or moderation problems later. Others suggest new features, but many say it should stay simple. There is talk about how easy it is to set up, and questions about hosting or scaling it. Some ask how it compares to other small social network projects. Overall, the main feeling is that simple tools like this are refreshing and worth trying, even if only for small groups of friends or communities.

## Insights on Teufel's First Open-Source Speaker

- 原文链接: [Insights on Teufel's First Open-Source Speaker](https://blog.teufelaudio.com/visionary-mynds-insights-on-teufels-first-open-source-speaker/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44627158)

Teufel made their first open-source Bluetooth speaker, called the MYND, with a focus on long life, repair, and user creativity. The team behind the MYND wanted to lower the environmental impact by making a speaker that can be used for many years and fixed easily by anyone. The battery, which is usually the first part to break, is simple to replace, and there are tutorials to help users do this themselves. All electronic parts come from well-known makers and can be swapped out without special tools. The main body uses plastics that are up to 50% recycled and can be recycled again in the future. The inside is simple, with little glue, so repairs are easy and quick.

MYND is also open-source, so all the design files, PCB diagrams, and software are online. People can 3D print the case or build the speaker from scratch using their own parts, except for some special drivers. Users can also change the sound settings to fit their taste. The speaker is designed to be as small as possible without extra parts, so it is both strong and simple. Portability was another big idea—MYND has straps and hooks for carrying it anywhere, and it is built to resist water or dirt at parties or outdoors. There is also a power bank feature, so you can charge your phone at events.

The makers hope people will recycle the parts or even turn the speaker into something new, like a guitar amp or a streaming device. The open-source files make it possible to upgrade or change the speaker as technology moves forward. The team wanted to make a product that is good for both normal users and people who like to tinker.

In the Hacker News comments, many users liked the open-source idea and the focus on repair. Some said it is rare to see real open hardware from big companies. A few were worried about how “open” it really is, since some parts are only from Teufel. Others liked that the files are online, but asked for more details like the license and how easy it is to get replacement drivers. Some users said the design could help fight electronic waste, while others thought most customers still just want cheap, non-repairable speakers. A few people shared stories about fixing old speakers and wished more companies would care about repair. Some hackers were excited about the chance to turn the MYND into other devices, like Internet radios or smart home speakers. But a few were unsure if “open source” is just a marketing trick, and wanted to see more products like this before calling it a big change.
