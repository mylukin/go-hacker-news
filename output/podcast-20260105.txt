Hello everyone, this is the 2026-01-05 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we bring you the latest stories and discussions from the tech world, covering internet security, career advice, tools for developers, design trends, clean energy progress, and more.

First, let’s look at a strange event in Venezuela during a major power blackout. An article explored how BGP—the Border Gateway Protocol, which controls internet traffic routes—showed unusual activity just before the blackout. Data revealed odd routing paths through Venezuela’s main telecom CANTV, an Italian provider, and a Colombian carrier. There was a spike in BGP announcements and a drop in active IP addresses before the power went out. Some of the affected IP ranges belonged to Dayco Telecom, which serves banks and internet services. One strange detail was the repeated appearance of the CANTV number in the routing path, making the route less attractive for normal traffic. This happened hours before important political and military events. The article raised questions about whether someone was trying to gather intelligence by redirecting traffic, but said many details remain unclear.

In the comments, some people said BGP problems happen often and might be mistakes. Others thought the timing and repeated numbers were suspicious. There was worry about how easy it is to change BGP routes, which could be used for spying or attacks. Some users wanted more proof before blaming anyone, while others shared tools for checking BGP safety. The community was split between seeing this as a planned move or just a coincidence, but most agreed BGP is a weak spot for the whole internet.

Next, we have some career advice that sparked a lot of discussion. The article shared the best tip the author got for getting promoted: start acting like you already have the job you want. This means doing more than your current role, solving bigger problems, and helping the team—not just yourself. The author gave an example of a junior engineer who took the lead to fix a team problem with a clear plan. The key is to show this behavior over a long period, not just once, because managers want to trust you before giving you more responsibility. The advice is to act first, and the title will follow.

Many in the comments agreed, saying this worked for them too. Some warned that extra effort is not always noticed, and you should make sure your manager sees what you do. A few said you need to avoid burnout and be careful if your manager is not fair. Some noted that not every company has room for more leaders, so promotions can still be rare. Still, most believed showing you can handle more responsibility is the best way to move up.

Let’s talk about Tailsnitch, a new tool for checking security in your Tailscale network. Tailsnitch scans your setup for problems like too much access, weak keys, and risky settings. It offers over 50 checks, covering access control, authentication, device security, network exposure, SSH, and logging. The tool shows problems by severity, allows you to filter and fix some issues, and can export reports for audits. You can set it up easily and use it with teams thanks to OAuth support. It even works in CI/CD pipelines, failing builds if it finds critical risks.

Commenters were excited, saying Tailscale is popular but easy to misconfigure. They liked that Tailsnitch finds problems before attackers do. Some hoped Tailscale would add more built-in safety checks. Others warned to be careful with auto-fix, since automatic changes might break something. There were questions about how Tailsnitch works with big networks and requests for new features like alerts. Many said open-source tools like this are important, but no tool is a full replacement for a real security review.

Now, let’s remember Yahoo Pipes, an early online tool for connecting and filtering data from different websites without code. Yahoo Pipes started in 2006 and let users drag and drop blocks to build data feeds from news, blogs, and more. It was inspired by Unix pipelines and Apple’s Automator, but made for the web. Yahoo Pipes helped many people learn about programming and data flows, but it struggled with scaling, making money, and support from Yahoo. It was shut down in 2015, but inspired later tools like Node-RED and Huginn.

On Hacker News, many shared fond memories of Yahoo Pipes, saying it made programming easier for beginners. Some said it helped them create their own projects. A few discussed problems like scaling, copyright, and the shift to closed APIs. There was talk about why visual programming is still not mainstream and how today’s web would make a new Pipes hard to build. Still, most comments were nostalgic and full of respect for what Yahoo Pipes made possible.

Next, an article criticized the new icons added to every menu item in macOS Tahoe. The author argued that instead of helping, these icons make menus more cluttered and confusing. Icons are supposed to speed up finding menu items, but if every item has one, nothing stands out. The article also pointed out problems with tiny, detailed icons that are hard to see, inconsistent icon use, and blurry graphics on high-res screens. The author believes that if an action has no clear icon, it’s better to have no icon at all.

In the comments, many agreed, saying the new menus are harder to use and slower to scan. Some defended Apple, saying icons help new users or those who don’t speak English well. Others felt making a good icon for every action is almost impossible, and suggested letting users turn icons off. There was also some humor about the tiny icon details and talk about design trends going in cycles. Most people hoped Apple would listen to feedback and improve things.

Let’s move to a technical topic: making text chunking much faster for large language models. The article explained that simple chunking by fixed length often breaks sentences, while splitting at natural points like periods or newlines gives better results. The fastest methods use byte-level search tools like the Rust memchr library, which can find delimiters very quickly using CPU instructions. For more delimiters, it uses a fast lookup table. Another trick is searching backwards from the chunk size to find the last delimiter before the chunk ends.

The author’s memchunk library reached speeds up to 164 GB/s, much faster than other chunking tools, and has Python and JavaScript bindings. In the comments, readers praised the technical depth and shared their own tips. Some wondered if such speed is needed in real use, since disk or network access is usually slower. Others discussed if more advanced sentence splitting is ever worth the extra cost. There was also talk about language differences, edge cases, and how to use the library in pipelines. Most people liked the practical, performance-first approach.

Now, we turn to the legal world. An article examined how Westlaw and LexisNexis control access to legal information in the U.S. These companies grew big by collecting court decisions and buying rivals. Even though a court once ruled that legal page numbers can’t be copyrighted, Westlaw and LexisNexis stayed dominant, charging high fees for legal research. Even PACER, the government’s system for court documents, is expensive and hard to use.

Many commenters agreed high costs block access to justice and make law less open. Some remembered using old law books and thought digital should be cheaper, not more costly. A few said the government should run a free legal search service and noted that some countries make legal info easier to get. There were worries about quality and the power of big companies to block new rivals. Some hoped AI could help, but only if data is open. Most agreed that more open law would help everyone, but change is slow.

Next, we have good news in clean energy. In 2025, wind and solar power made more electricity than coal for the first time worldwide. Electric cars were more than a quarter of new car sales, and over half in China. Battery prices dropped 90% in ten years, making solar power usable any time. Even with less support in the U.S., global investment in clean energy is at a record high, and China’s emissions are now going down.

In the comments, people were excited that clean energy is working on a big scale. Some worried that fossil fuels are still used too much and that the U.S. might fall behind. Others asked if batteries and electric grids are ready for so many renewables and discussed challenges like rare metals and recycling. Many were hopeful that as prices fall, the switch to clean energy will speed up, but noted there are still problems to solve.

Let’s remember David Rosen, the co-founder of Sega, who passed away recently. Rosen started by selling art and making photo booths in Japan, then led Sega as it became famous for arcade games and home consoles like the Genesis. He helped bring new ideas from Japan to the world and made games like Space Harrier and Sonic the Hedgehog popular everywhere.

Hacker News users shared memories of playing Sega games and talked about how Rosen helped shape the video game industry. Some shared interviews and stories, wishing more people knew about his work. Many thanked him for the fun and happiness Sega games brought to their lives.

Next, we have DoNotNotify, a new Android app that lets you control which notifications you get. It works like a firewall for notifications, letting you block or allow alerts by app, message content, or advanced patterns. All filtering happens offline, with no data sent to servers, and the app promises strong privacy. The interface is simple and easy to set up, and you can find it on Google Play.

Many commenters liked the idea, saying notification spam is a real problem. They praised the privacy focus and offline processing. Some had questions about device compatibility and permissions, and a few worried Google might block such apps. Some wanted an open-source version to trust it more. There were ideas for using it to help parents or reduce distractions at work. Most agreed it could help make notifications more useful and less annoying.

That’s all for today’s episode. Thank you for listening to Hacker News Daily Podcast. We hope you enjoyed this roundup of the latest stories and ideas from the tech community. See you next time!
