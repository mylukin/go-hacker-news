## Publish (On Your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere

- 原文链接: [Publish (On Your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere](https://indieweb.org/POSSE#)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46468600)

This article talks about POSSE, which means "Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere." The idea is to put your content on your own website first, then share copies or links on other platforms like Twitter, Facebook, or Mastodon.

The article says POSSE is good because it gives you control over your content. You are less dependent on other sites, and your posts can always be found at your own web address. If a social media site goes away, you still have your original post. When you share your content on other platforms, you can add a link back to your original, which helps people find your main site and helps your site rank better in search engines. This also makes it easier to search all your posts, since they are in one place. POSSE is not just for blogs; it can be used for photos, videos, and even code repositories. There are different tools and plugins for WordPress, Python, and other platforms that help automate POSSE. You can do it manually or set it up to happen automatically. Some people use services like Bridgy or IFTTT to help with posting everywhere.

The article also compares POSSE with similar ideas, like PESOS (posting on social media first, then copying to your site) and COPE (Create Once, Publish Everywhere). POSSE is better because it makes it clear which post is the original. There are examples from many people who have used POSSE for years, showing it works with many different websites and tools. The article gives advice for developers, explaining how to set up automatic or manual syndication, and even how to handle updates and deletions of posts across platforms.

Looking at the top Hacker News comments, some people really like the idea of owning your own content. They say POSSE can protect you from losing your posts if a platform shuts down or changes its rules. Others point out that setting up POSSE can be hard for normal users, because it needs some technical skill or special tools. A few think that just sharing a link to your website is enough, since most big platforms show a preview card anyway. Some are worried about duplicate content in search engines, but the article explains that linking back to your original site helps with this. One commenter says POSSE is too broad and confusing for beginners, and setup guides should be simpler. Another says that social media silos like Facebook and Twitter do not make it easy to use RSS or open standards, so POSSE is a way to get around these limits. Some like that POSSE helps bring people back to the open web, not just inside closed platforms. Others wonder if it is worth the time to set up POSSE if you do not have many readers. There is also concern that social media platforms might block or limit these cross-posts in the future. A few wish there were easier tools with simple instructions so more people could use POSSE. Overall, people agree that owning your content is important, but there are mixed feelings about how easy POSSE is for most people to use right now.

## Unix v4 (1973) – Live Terminal

- 原文链接: [Unix v4 (1973) – Live Terminal](https://unixv4.dev/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46468283)

This website lets you use Unix version 4 from 1973 through a live terminal in your browser. The system runs on an emulated PDP-11/45 computer, showing what computing was like over 50 years ago.

Unix v4 was the first version written in the C language, which made it much easier to run on different types of hardware. The copy available here is the only known one, found after 52 years on a magnetic tape at the University of Utah. You can choose different terminal styles, like classic green or amber, to match the old screens of the time.

The system comes with some basic commands, like listing files with `ls`, editing text with `ed`, and compiling C programs with `cc`. There are also simple demo programs in the `/demo` folder, including `hello.c` and some games. You can browse the Unix kernel source code in `/usr/source`, and try vintage games in `/usr/games`.

This Unix experience keeps things very authentic. For example, backspace does not work; you must use `#` to delete a character or `@` to erase a line. There are no manual pages, and even the `cd` command is called `chdir`. Sessions are temporary and only last 10 minutes if you are idle. Nothing is saved between sessions, and everything resets on page reload.

The website also has a guestbook so users can leave feedback or comments. Server statistics show how many people are using the terminal at any time.

In the Hacker News comments, many users were excited to try such an old version of Unix and enjoyed seeing how computing worked in the 1970s. Some found it fun to write and run C programs in such a simple environment. Others mentioned the challenges, like not having modern conveniences such as working backspace or man pages. A few users shared memories of using PDP-11 computers or early Unix at school or work. Some people saw educational value in letting new programmers see how Unix started. Others found the quirks frustrating, but still respected the effort to keep it authentic. There were comments about the difficulty of editing files with `ed` and praise for the team who recovered and emulated this rare software. Some users discussed how Unix’s portability thanks to C was a big deal in computer history. Overall, most comments showed appreciation for the project and curiosity about old Unix systems.

Early buyers get a discount, and you can reserve one with a deposit or full payment.

In the Hacker News comments, some people are excited to see phones with physical keyboards coming back. They say typing on glass is hard and miss devices like the BlackBerry. Others wonder if the phone will be too big or heavy because of the keyboard and battery. A few users ask about the price, saying it might be too expensive for most people, especially since it’s a niche product.

Some commenters think the idea is cool but are worried there are not enough buyers for a keyboard phone, so the company could fail. Others wish there were more keyboard layout options, like AZERTY or QWERTZ, for different countries. Battery life concerns come up, but people like that the battery is big and the screen is small, which should help.

A few mention that voice-to-text and fast typing shortcuts could be helpful for business use. Some worry that updates and support won’t last, based on past experiences with small phone makers. There’s also talk about the phone’s look—some love the retro style, while others say it looks old-fashioned. Finally, some users are happy to see a headphone jack and microSD slot, which many new phones don’t have anymore.

## TinyTinyTPU: 2×2 systolic-array TPU-style matrix-multiply unit deployed on FPGA

- 原文链接: [TinyTinyTPU: 2×2 systolic-array TPU-style matrix-multiply unit deployed on FPGA](https://github.com/Alanma23/tinytinyTPU-co)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46468237)

This project is about a small version of a TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) called TinyTinyTPU, made for learning and simple use on an FPGA board. It copies Google’s TPU design but uses only a 2×2 systolic array, which means it has four small processing units that work together to multiply matrices.

The TinyTinyTPU can do all the main steps needed for small machine learning models: it can store numbers (weights), multiply them with input data, add up the results, run activation functions like ReLU, normalize the output, and turn it into small int8 numbers for easy use. It connects to a computer with a simple UART cable, so you can send commands and get results back. The design is light—using only about 5% of the logic on a cheap Basys3 FPGA board. You can test it with Python scripts, and even run a gesture recognition demo, where it learns to tell if you moved your mouse more left-right or up-down.

The project is made for learning. It’s simple, so you can see how data moves across the systolic array: numbers flow sideways and down, and weights are loaded in a special pattern to keep everything in sync. There’s a full set of test scripts to check each part, and you can view timing and signals in real-time with tools like GTKWave. The source code is written in SystemVerilog, and you can build it using both the standard Xilinx Vivado tools or open-source tools like Yosys and nextpnr, though open-source support is still growing.

To use it, you need some software tools (Verilator, cocotb, Python), and the Basys3 FPGA board. The project shows you how to set up the software, load the design onto the FPGA, and run models from your computer. There’s also a clear directory structure, so you know where to find the code, tests, FPGA files, and host scripts.

In the Hacker News comments, some people are impressed by how small and clear the design is. They say this is great for students or anyone new to FPGAs and hardware ML. Others like that you can use open-source tools, which makes it more accessible. A few users point out that a 2×2 array is tiny—it’s not useful for real ML tasks, but it’s perfect for learning and demos. Some share stories of building their own tiny accelerators and agree it’s fun and educational. There are questions about scaling the design—if you made it bigger, could you run real models? Others discuss the tricky parts of getting open-source FPGA tools to work well, and some complain about Xilinx Vivado being big and slow. People like the clear testing setup and the fact you can see real signals and waveforms. A few ask about power use and speed, while others just thank the author for sharing a full project that’s easy to follow and try out.

## FracturedJson

- 原文链接: [FracturedJson](https://github.com/j-brooke/FracturedJson/wiki)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46464235)

FracturedJson is a set of tools that formats JSON data so it is easy to read, but still compact. The main idea is to make JSON files clear for people, without wasting space or making them hard to scan.

Most JSON tools give you two choices: minified (all data in one long line, hard to read) or pretty-printed (lots of lines, hard to scan). FracturedJson tries to find a better way. It keeps arrays and objects on single lines if they are not too long or complex. If there are many similar items, it lines them up like a table, so it is easy to compare fields. Long arrays can appear with several items per line, not just one per line.

You do not have to set many options; it works well out of the box. But you can control things like how deep nesting is allowed on one line, how many items go in a row, and if comments are kept. It can also keep comments in the output, even though this is not allowed by standard JSON. You can use FracturedJson as a browser tool, a .NET library, a JavaScript/TypeScript package, or a Visual Studio Code extension.

The formatter uses four main styles: inlined (all on one line), compact multiline array (many items per line), table (fields lined up), and expanded (spread out with indentation). There are many settings to change the output, such as line length, padding, how comments are handled, and more. You can pick what works best for your needs.

From the comments, many people say this tool is very helpful when they work with big or complex JSON files. Some say it is much easier to read than normal pretty-printed JSON. Others like that it can keep comments, since sometimes they need to explain parts of the data. A few users mention that it saves time when they compare data or debug problems.

Some people ask if there is something similar for other file formats, like YAML or XML. Others wonder about using it in different programming languages, and they like that there are several options. One user says the table format is great when fields repeat, but might be less useful for very mixed data. Another user points out that the tool makes it simple to spot mistakes or missing values.

A few commenters share tips on using the command-line options or integrating the tool with their workflow. Some wish other JSON libraries would include these features by default. There is also a short discussion about whether comments should be allowed in JSON, with some for and some against. Overall, most people think FracturedJson is a smart idea and are glad to see a fresh approach to JSON formatting.

## Fighting Fire with Fire: Scalable Oral Exams

- 原文链接: [Fighting Fire with Fire: Scalable Oral Exams](https://www.behind-the-enemy-lines.com/2025/12/fighting-fire-with-fire-scalable-oral.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46467677)

A university class noticed students were submitting homework that seemed too perfect, likely written by AI tools. To check real understanding, they replaced traditional exams with oral exams using an AI voice agent from ElevenLabs.

The AI exam had two parts: students discussed their project, then answered questions on a case study. The voice agent was built to ask dynamic, personalized questions and managed the exam using several sub-agents, like authentication, project discussion, and case discussion. The system was fast to set up, cheap (about $0.42 per student), and scalable to bigger classes. Grading was done by a council of three AI models (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT) that reviewed each other's work to reach fairer grades and detailed feedback. They found that when students gave clear answers, graders agreed more. Vague answers led to disagreement, especially on topics like experimentation.

Problems came up. The cloned voice used for the agent felt harsh and made students anxious. Sometimes the AI asked too many questions at once, making it hard to answer. It also sometimes paraphrased questions instead of repeating them exactly, confusing students. The agent tended to fill silences too quickly, not giving enough time to think. Plus, its method for picking random case studies wasn’t random, so the same cases kept coming up. These were fixed by improving prompts, pacing, and adding real randomness in the code.

Students were asked to record themselves during the exam, stopping them from cheating by having someone else answer. The process was open: students knew the format and types of questions, helping them prepare better. Most students said the AI oral exam was more stressful than written exams and preferred traditional formats, but they agreed it tested real understanding well. They liked the flexibility to take the exam anywhere, but wanted calmer voices and slower pacing.

Hacker News commenters had mixed feelings. Some really liked the creative use of AI to solve real problems with assessment and cheating. They thought the low cost and scalable grading were big wins. Several pointed out that oral exams do test deeper understanding and are harder to game, but worried about students’ increased stress and the fairness of voice-based exams, especially for non-native speakers or those with anxiety. Others wondered if the AI agents could ever fully replace human nuance in conversation and grading, while a few thought this approach might be too harsh, or could miss important context that humans catch. Some said the detailed feedback from AI was impressive and more useful than what many teachers provide. There was also debate about privacy and the ethics of recording students, as well as whether making exams harder to cheat just leads to new types of cheating. Many agreed that assessment needs to adapt as AI changes how students work, but said it’s important to keep the focus on learning, not just catching cheaters.

## IPv6 just turned 30 and still hasn't taken over the world

- 原文链接: [IPv6 just turned 30 and still hasn't taken over the world](https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/31/ipv6_at_30/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46465327)

IPv6, the next version of the Internet Protocol, is now 30 years old but is still not the main way we connect to the internet. The article explains why IPv6 has not replaced IPv4 everywhere, even after all this time. IPv6 was created in the 1990s because experts saw that we would soon run out of IPv4 addresses, which are the unique numbers needed for every device online. IPv6 increased the number of possible addresses from about 4 billion to an almost endless amount, which should have solved the problem. But today, less than half of internet users actually use IPv6.

One big reason is that IPv6 is not backward-compatible; you need to choose IPv4 or IPv6, or run both at the same time. IPv6 also did not add many new features beyond more addresses. Many hoped for better security or easier setups, but most improvements were later added to IPv4 instead. "Network Address Translation" (NAT) made it possible to have many devices share one IPv4 address, so there was less pressure to move to IPv6. Changing to IPv6 can be complex and expensive, with little short-term benefit, so many companies have not switched.

Still, experts say IPv6 is not a failure. It allows the internet to keep growing, especially for mobile phones, cloud services, and new devices like smart home gadgets. Some big companies and countries are now using more IPv6, and it is important for the future. Some people think that new ways of connecting, like using DNS names and new protocols such as QUIC, make the kind of address less important. Others say that as IPv4 addresses become harder to get—or more expensive—IPv6 use will increase.

In the comment section, many people agree that NAT and other workarounds made IPv4 last much longer than expected. Some say that IPv6 lost its main reason to exist once NAT became popular. Others think the lack of backward compatibility was a big mistake, making the change much harder. A few commenters believe IPv6 is still too complex or poorly designed. Other users point out that in some countries, especially in Asia, IPv6 is used much more than in the US or Europe. Some people see IPv6 as a slow-moving success, saying it is quietly working where it is most needed. There is debate about whether we will ever fully move away from IPv4, but many agree that as the internet grows, IPv6 will become more important. Some also mention that cloud providers may soon charge more for IPv4, pushing more people to IPv6. Despite slow progress, most commenters do not call IPv6 a failure—they see it as a long-term solution waiting for its moment.

## Punkt. Unveils MC03 Smartphone

- 原文链接: [Punkt. Unveils MC03 Smartphone](https://www.punkt.ch/blogs/news/punkt-unveils-mc03)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46466364)

Punkt. has launched a new smartphone called the MC03, focused on giving users full control over their data and privacy. The phone is made in Europe, uses a custom operating system called AphyOS, and is built for people who want less tracking and fewer distractions.

The MC03 has two main areas for apps: the Vault, which only allows trusted and approved apps for maximum privacy, and the Wild Web, where you can install any app but with strict privacy controls. The phone comes with strong partnerships, such as Proton for secure email, calendar, storage, and VPN. The hardware is premium, with a 120Hz OLED display, a removable battery, IP68 water resistance, and a 64MP camera. There’s a built-in VPN called Digital Nomad for privacy while traveling. The Ledger feature lets users see and control what data each app can access, and even shows how much energy each app uses. The phone costs $699 and includes a year-long subscription to AphyOS; after that, it’s $9.99 per month, or less if you buy a bundle for several years. Punkt. says you pay for the phone and service so your data is not sold or used for ads, unlike with many big tech phones.

In the Hacker News comments, some people like the focus on privacy and the idea of paying for a phone that does not track them. Others are happy to see a phone with a removable battery and repairable, sustainable design. Some users say they want more phones like this, but worry about the high price and monthly subscription—it adds up. A few are unsure if the phone can really be secure if users can install any app in the Wild Web. Some wonder if the privacy claims are too good to be true, and ask for open-source code and proof of security. Others compare this to other privacy phones and ask how it is better. There are also questions about app support, updates, and if it will work well for daily use. Some say the phone is still too “smart” and want even simpler devices. Finally, a few people think it’s a good step, but not enough to break away from big tech, since so many people need apps from Google or Apple.

## 10 years of personal finances in plain text files

- 原文链接: [10 years of personal finances in plain text files](https://sgoel.dev/posts/10-years-of-personal-finances-in-plain-text-files/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46463644)

This article is about someone who has tracked their personal finances for 10 years using plain text files and a tool called Beancount. The author spends about 30 to 45 minutes each month downloading bank statements and importing them into their system.

The author’s Beancount ledger now has over 45,000 lines, spread across 16 files, and covers nearly 10,000 transactions. They keep everything in a folder on their laptop, which is also version controlled with git. There are about 1,000 different accounts in Beancount, but these are not bank accounts, just ways to organize money (like for groceries, salary, or subscriptions). The author also stores about 500 PDF documents, such as receipts, right next to the transactions for easy access, especially during tax season.

Each month, the author logs into their banks, downloads CSV statements, and runs them through a Python "importer" script. This script changes the data into the format Beancount understands. Then the author checks each entry, making sure the numbers add up correctly. Some of this work is automated, but some needs to be done by hand. At the start of each new year, they move last year’s data into a separate file to keep things tidy.

Because the author lives in Germany, they had to write special importers for different German banks. They shared these tools online for others to use. At first, learning Beancount was hard, so the author wrote a short book to help beginners. The book got good reviews, and it’s been helpful to many.

The author says the best thing about this system is that all their data is on their own computer, not in the cloud. The files are simple text, easy to read or move, and not tied to any one app. They feel this makes Beancount very powerful and future-proof.

In the comments, many people praise the author’s discipline and like the idea of owning your own data. Some say using plain text and version control is smart because it’s simple and safe. Others point out that tools like Beancount might be hard for beginners, but worth it over time. A few people share that they use similar systems, like Ledger or hledger, and agree that it’s helpful for understanding money better. Some ask about automating the process or suggest ways to make importers easier to use. Others mention worries about losing data or the work involved in keeping up with manual entry. There are also comments about privacy and how many finance apps sell user data, so local storage is safer. A few people say they tried personal finance apps but found they didn’t last as long as plain text files. Some commenters are curious about Beancount’s features and ask if it can handle more complex needs, like investments or taxes. Finally, several people thank the author for sharing their experience and resources, saying it inspired them to try plain text accounting themselves.
