Hello everyone, this is the 2025-11-17 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have a collection of stories about new technology, open hardware, creative projects, and ideas from the Hacker News community.

Let’s start with a look at Ruby’s new performance boost. Ruby 3.x now uses a technology called YJIT, a Just-In-Time compiler, to turn Ruby code into machine language. Normally, Ruby runs code line by line in an interpreter. YJIT changes this by counting how often each block or function runs. If it’s used a lot—like over 30 times in a small program—YJIT compiles it into fast machine code that your computer can run directly. It keeps a counter for every function, and when it hits the threshold, it builds a YJIT block to store the machine instructions. YJIT also uses “branch stubs” to wait and see what type of values are used, making the system flexible and fast. Most readers are excited about the speed boost and hope Ruby will become more popular for big web apps. Some developers shared stories of faster code, while others wondered about real-world speed, debugging, and the next step, called ZJIT. There’s also discussion about how similar this is to JavaScript JITs and if the extra complexity is worth it. Overall, many see this as a big step forward for Ruby.

Next, we have a heartwarming hardware story. A parent built a simple synthesizer for their three-year-old daughter as a birthday gift. This small synth is a step-sequencer with four sliders, letting the child make music by moving them up and down. The device has controls for tempo, volume, scale, and more, with an OLED screen showing a dancing panda. The case was made with a 3D printer, and the electronics are on a custom PCB. The author learned everything from microcontrollers to CAD design, starting with an Arduino and working up to a stand-alone synth. They used online simulators, designed a case in Fusion 360, and handled problems like slow screen updates and fragile wiring. The final toy is sturdy and a favorite in the toy box. Many commenters praised the project for being creative and educational, with some sharing their own DIY toy stories. Some suggested open-sourcing the design or offering kits, while others gave tips for making it easier to manufacture or more robust. There are also reminders about the difficulty of making and selling hardware for kids due to safety laws. Overall, it’s an inspiring project that mixes learning, music, and family.

Our next story is about the “One Student One Chip” course. This program teaches students to design and build their own computer chips, starting with basics like digital circuits and moving up to advanced topics like cache and running Linux. Students use tools like Logisim, learn C and hardware description languages, and finally build a mini RISC-V processor. The course has many videos and resources, and welcomes beginners with patience and extra help. Many in the comments are excited about hands-on chip learning, saying it’s better than just theory. Some compare it to older courses like MIT’s 6.004 or “Nand2Tetris.” There are questions about cost and how real chip manufacturing works, but most agree just designing and simulating chips is a big achievement. People hope to see more open courses like this in the future.

Now on to a young developer’s achievement. A 13-year-old built PrinceJS, a super-fast web framework for Bun, able to handle 19,200 requests per second in just 2.8 kilobytes of code. The framework is open source and has basic features like routing. The creator wanted to learn about servers and made something real and useful. The community is impressed by the developer’s age and skill, with some asking about the performance tests and Bun’s stability. Others suggest more features or tips for even faster code. There’s also discussion about whether frameworks need to be tiny or if larger code can help developers work more easily. Most comments are supportive, with helpful advice and encouragement for young coders.

Next, we have a personal story about learning social skills. The writer describes growing up feeling awkward and lonely, and how he tried to impress others by acting smart and interesting. This approach didn’t work well. Later, by working in restaurants, he watched how good servers adjusted their style to fit the mood of customers, and learned to be more flexible and responsive. He even tried acting a bit odd on purpose, which helped people connect with him better. Over time, he learned to pay attention to body language, be present, and balance openness with caution. Many listeners relate to this journey, saying social skills can be learned step by step. Some warn that being too open or quirky can be risky, and not everyone can easily read non-verbal signals. Others say that being kind and authentic is more important than being “normal.” The comments are full of personal stories, tips, and thanks for showing change is possible.

Let’s talk about Project Gemini, a new internet protocol designed for simple, safe, text-only browsing. Gemini is like a small, quiet library on the internet, with no ads, tracking, or big media—just plain text and links. The idea is to give people a break from the noisy, complex web. Many on Hacker News like the idea, saying it’s good for old computers, slow connections, and privacy. Some think Gemini is too simple and will not replace the modern web, since most people want images and interactive sites. There are worries about it being hard for normal users, but some developers enjoy building tools or writing blogs for Gemini just for fun. Most agree Gemini will stay a small community, but it’s a good reminder that the internet does not have to be complicated.

Next is ESPectre, a project that detects motion in your home using only Wi-Fi signals, not cameras or microphones. It works with a cheap ESP32-S3 device and links to Home Assistant for smart home setups. The sensor listens for changes in Wi-Fi waves caused by movement, using math and statistics, not machine learning. It can see through walls and is private, since it does not collect pictures or sounds. Many people like the low cost and privacy, while some wonder if it can tell people apart from pets or work in rooms with lots of Wi-Fi noise. Some raise privacy concerns, but the author says to always get permission from everyone at home. With more work, the tech could soon tell different activities or even who is moving. The community sees lots of promise for security, elderly care, and smart lights—all for just €10 in hardware.

Now, let’s talk about FreeMDU, an open project for talking to Miele appliances over their hidden optical interface. Normally, only expensive and closed tools from Miele could do this, but now FreeMDU makes it possible for anyone with open hardware and software. You can check, test, or connect your appliances to smart home systems, but it’s still experimental and could risk damaging your device. People are excited about open tools for appliances, saying it helps users fix their own stuff and keeps old machines running longer. Some warn about the risk and about voiding warranties. There’s discussion on why more companies don’t allow open access to diagnostics, and some hope this inspires similar projects for other brands. Most comments are positive and hope for more open hardware in the future.

Next, the European Space Agency is studying if insects can be a good food for astronauts on long space missions. Insects are light, tough, and full of nutrition. Many people on Earth already eat them, and they are good for recycling waste. Some insects have gone to space before, but most tests were short. Now, ESA wants to see if they can live and reproduce in space over longer times. People have mixed feelings—some think it’s practical, others are unsure about eating bugs, especially for comfort food. Some say the research can help solve food problems on Earth too. There are worries about allergies and raising insects in space, but also jokes about “space bugs.” Most agree it’s a smart idea to test first on Earth and see if it works for space.

Finally, Google has released WeatherNext 2, a new AI model for fast, detailed weather forecasts. It uses a special AI system to make hundreds of predictions in less than a minute, all on a single computer chip. WeatherNext 2 can predict temperature, wind, and humidity with more accuracy, and gives updates every hour for up to 15 days. It’s now part of Google’s weather products, and open for developers in Earth Engine and BigQuery. Some people are excited about the speed and detail, saying it could change weather planning. Others have questions about how well it works with less data, or if the AI’s predictions can be trusted and explained. Some like that Google is sharing the model, while others want to see similar tools from other companies. There are also questions about energy use and cost. Most agree this is a big step for using AI in weather forecasting and hope it will combine with traditional science for the best results.
