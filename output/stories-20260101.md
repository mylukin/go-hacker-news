This article says the internet used to be a place for learning, making friends, and sharing ideas, but now it feels bad for many people. The writer explains how the web changed from being full of personal websites and creative spaces into a few big platforms that control what we see and how we connect. At first, the internet was open and fun, but now it is dominated by companies that focus on making money and capturing our attention. The author compares this change to how cars started as a helpful tool but ended up shaping cities around them, making life harder for people without cars. He uses ideas from Ivan Illich, who said that tools should help people be free and creative, but when tools become too powerful, they start to control us instead.

The article gives examples from history, like the textile industry, antibiotics, and space exploration, to show how new technology often starts out helpful but can bring problems when it becomes too widespread and commercial. For the web, this means ads everywhere, loss of ownership over our content, and less real connection with others. The writer suggests that the answer is to return to building personal websites—simple, hand-coded, and owned by their creators. He recommends starting small, not worrying about perfect design, and using IndieWeb tools to make it easy to share and connect. The article ends with a call to reclaim the internet by creating your own space, away from big platforms.

In the Hacker News comments, some people agree that the internet feels worse now and miss the days of personal websites and small online communities. They share stories about their own early websites and how fun it was to just make things for themselves and their friends. Others say that the internet is still full of creativity and that new tools like Mastodon and IndieWeb make it easier to build personal spaces again. Some users think that big platforms are not all bad, because they help connect people and give small creators a big audience. A few people argue that the old internet had problems too, like being less accessible and less diverse.

There are also comments about how hard it can be to keep a personal website running, especially with changes in hosting, security, and web standards. Some worry that most people won’t make their own sites because it takes time and technical skills. Others suggest that making simple blogs or using easy tools can lower the barrier and that even small steps help. Many agree with the article’s message to “own your content,” but they also warn that going back to the old web is not possible for everyone. Overall, the discussion is a mix of nostalgia, practical advice, and hope that the web can become more friendly and personal again.

## Cameras and Lenses (2020)

- 原文链接: [Cameras and Lenses (2020)](https://ciechanow.ski/cameras-and-lenses/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46455872)

This article explains how cameras and lenses work, starting from basic ideas. It talks about how a camera records light and how different parts of the camera change how pictures look.

First, it describes how old cameras used film, but now most cameras use digital sensors. These sensors are made of tiny detectors that collect light. If the camera collects light for a short time, the image is dark. If it collects light for too long, the image is too bright. To get color pictures, sensors use small color filters for red, green, and blue. The camera fills in missing color information using a process called demosaicing. 

Next, the article shows that if you only use a bare sensor, the picture looks messy because light comes from every direction. To fix this, you can put the sensor inside a dark box with a small hole—this is called a pinhole camera. This camera gives an upside-down image. Making the hole smaller makes the image sharper, but also darker. If you make the hole too small, the image gets blurry again.

To get more light and control what is sharp or blurry, cameras use lenses. The article explains how glass bends light and how the shape and material of the lens change how light is focused. Lenses can focus light from far away to a single point, making a clear image. The distance between the lens and the sensor changes how much of the scene you see and what is in focus. Lenses with fixed focal length are called prime lenses; those that can change focal length are zoom lenses.

The article also explains the aperture, which is a hole that controls how much light enters the camera. A bigger aperture lets in more light but makes only a small part of the picture sharp (shallow depth of field). A smaller aperture makes more of the scene sharp, but lets in less light. The f-number shows the ratio between lens size and opening size; smaller f-numbers mean more light and a brighter image.

Finally, the article talks about lens problems, called aberrations, like blurry edges or colors not lining up. Camera makers use special lens shapes and materials to fix these problems. Real cameras have many lenses inside to get better pictures.

In the comments, readers praise the article for its clear pictures and easy explanations. Some say it is great for beginners and even good for teaching kids about cameras. Others like the interactive demos and wish more science articles used them. A few people share their own stories about building pinhole cameras or learning about optics in school. Some photographers discuss how understanding lenses helps them take better photos. There are also comments pointing out small mistakes or suggesting more detail about digital sensors. A few readers compare this article to camera manuals and say this is much more fun and helpful. Some mention that lens problems like chromatic aberration are a big issue in cheap lenses. Others say they finally understand what the f-number means after reading the article. Finally, some thank the author for making a hard topic easy to understand.

## Linux is good now; to feel like you actually own your PC, put Linux on it

- 原文链接: [Linux is good now; to feel like you actually own your PC, put Linux on it](https://www.pcgamer.com/software/linux/im-brave-enough-to-say-it-linux-is-good-now-and-if-you-want-to-feel-like-you-actually-own-your-pc-make-2026-the-year-of-linux-on-your-desktop/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46457770)

This article says more people should use Linux if they want to really control their own computers. The writer explains that Windows and Mac computers often have limits, ads, or tracking, while Linux lets you choose what happens on your own machine.

They say Linux is free, open source, and has many versions you can pick from. You can change almost anything in Linux, like the way it looks, what programs it runs, and how updates work. The article says Linux works better than before—it’s easier to install, has good drivers, and supports most hardware. You can use Linux for normal things like web browsing, watching videos, and writing documents. For gaming, Linux has gotten much better, too, with tools like Proton and Steam making it possible to play many Windows games.

The writer points out that Linux does not have built-in ads or collect your data. Updates on Linux are not forced, so you can choose when to update. They also say that Linux is safer from viruses and can run on older computers, so you don’t need the newest hardware. The article suggests trying out a “live USB” version of Linux first, which lets you test it without installing. The writer believes using Linux makes you feel more like you own your computer.

In the comment section, many people agree Linux is better for privacy and control. Some share stories about switching to Linux and feeling happier. Others say Linux is still hard for new users, especially if you need special software or play a lot of games. Some people mention hardware problems, like Wi-Fi or printers not working right away.

A few comments warn that Linux is not always as easy as Windows or Mac, and you may have to search online for help. Some users love customizing everything, but others just want a computer that “just works.” There are people who think Linux is great for servers but not always for desktop use. Others say Linux is much better now than it was years ago, and it keeps improving. Some users recommend certain Linux versions, like Ubuntu or Mint, for beginners. A few say they still need Windows for some work programs or games. Many agree that Linux helps you learn more about computers. Some warn that if you like things simple and never want to fix problems, Linux may not be for you.

## Gemini 3.0 Deciphered the Mystery of a Nuremberg Chronicle Leaf's

- 原文链接: [Gemini 3.0 Deciphered the Mystery of a Nuremberg Chronicle Leaf's](https://blog.gdeltproject.org/gemini-as-indiana-jones-how-gemini-3-0-deciphered-the-mystery-of-a-nuremberg-chronicle-leafs-500-year-old-roundels/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46456387)

This article is about how Gemini 3.0, an AI model, helped solve a mystery in a 500-year-old book called the Nuremberg Chronicle. On one page, someone long ago wrote four circles (roundels) with mysterious numbers and Latin words, and for centuries, no one was sure what they meant.

The Nuremberg Chronicle is a famous early printed book from 1493, full of pictures and history. The four roundels had strange numbers and abbreviations, and even experts could not explain them. The article shows how Gemini 3.0 was given photos of the page and the roundels, and asked to read the Latin, translate it, and explain the meaning. Gemini figured out that the circles were a kind of “date conversion table” made by a reader in the 1500s or 1600s. That reader wanted to compare two different Bible timelines for when Abraham was born: one from the Greek Old Testament (Septuagint), and one from the Hebrew Bible.

Gemini showed that two circles wrote the “Year of the World” (Anno Mundi) for Abraham’s birth using each Bible’s system. The other two circles showed the same event as “years before Christ” (BC), also for each system. The numbers are different because the Greek and Hebrew Bibles count years differently. The Greek system said Abraham was born in 3184 “Year of the World” or 2015 BC. The Hebrew system said 2040 “Year of the World” or 1915 BC—100 years later. Gemini explained all the Latin words, the Roman numerals, and how the math works out.

The model also studied the handwriting. Gemini said the script style was a mix of late Gothic and early Humanist, common in Germany around 1500–1550. The person who wrote the circles was likely a smart scholar or cleric, maybe a monk or university student, who was trying to solve the puzzle of different Bible timelines. The handwriting was clear but informal, the ink was old, and the circles were drawn by hand.

Gemini even translated the full Latin text of the page and explained the story about Abraham, his family, and the city of Memphis (Cairo) in Egypt. The model’s notes show it checked each number, re-read the text, compared timelines, and double-checked its Latin reading.

In the Hacker News comments, people are amazed at how far AI visual understanding has come. Some say it’s impressive that Gemini could read old handwriting and figure out the logic without help from humans. Others point out that Gemini still made small mistakes with some numbers, but the overall reasoning was strong. A few readers are surprised the AI could handle medieval abbreviations and Roman numerals, which even humans find tricky. There’s praise for how the AI not only read the text but also understood the historical and theological context.

Some commenters wonder if this will help historians solve other old mysteries. Others worry about trusting AI too much, since it can still get details wrong. A few discuss how this kind of tool might help people translate or study old books in the future. One person notes that the AI’s price for this analysis was very low, making it accessible for scholars. Others are excited to see AI used in digital humanities and hope for more projects like this. Some people raise questions about AI’s limits, like handling very poor handwriting or missing information. Overall, the discussion is positive and curious, with people both impressed and cautious about using AI for history.

## Dell's version of the DGX Spark fixes pain points

- 原文链接: [Dell's version of the DGX Spark fixes pain points](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/dells-version-dgx-spark-fixes-pain-points)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46457027)

Dell made a new mini workstation called the GB10, which is their version of Nvidia’s DGX Spark, a small computer for AI development. The article reviews this machine, showing how it fixes some problems found in the DGX Spark, but also points out its high price and limited use for most people.

The GB10 has some nice upgrades: it finally adds a power LED (missing from the DGX Spark), a stronger power supply (280W), and a better cooling system, making it quieter and cooler. The machine is not meant to replace a Mac mini or compete as the best value for running large language models (LLMs); instead, it’s for developers working in Nvidia’s ecosystem, especially those who need to connect to very fast networks like Nvidia’s big AI servers. The built-in networking ports are very fast—over 200 Gbps in some cases—but you need special network setups to reach top speeds.

The GB10 uses an Arm CPU called Grace (with 20 cores) and a Blackwell GPU. Both share 128 GB of fast memory, making the system good for AI tasks. The author was surprised at how well it ran games on Linux, even though Dell says it’s not for gaming. As a general computer, the GB10 is powerful and fast for coding, web use, and some media work, but it’s expensive, and support for Linux software is mixed. For example, some programs like Blender need special steps to work well on Arm. The machine runs on Nvidia’s DGX OS (based on Ubuntu), but software updates are only promised for 2 years, which is much shorter than many other systems.

Benchmark tests show the CPU is fast, about as good as AMD’s top desktop chips, but not as fast as Apple’s M3 Ultra. The power use is higher than expected for an Arm system. The networking is strong but can’t always reach advertised top speeds due to hardware limits. In AI performance, the GB10 is good at starting responses from models quickly, even if it’s not always the fastest at producing lots of tokens per second. So, the GB10 is best for certain AI developer tasks, not for everyone.

People in the comments had mixed views. Some liked that Dell listened to user feedback and added small features like a power LED and better cooling. Others complained about the high price—over $4,000—and said it’s too much for most users, especially when cheaper systems do almost as well. Many thought the short software support was a big problem, worrying that the machine would be hard to maintain in the future. Some developers liked the fast networking, saying it’s great for building AI clusters, but others thought most people won’t use this feature at home or in small offices. A few were excited to see strong Arm CPUs in desktop machines, but some doubted if Nvidia and Dell would keep supporting Arm well on Linux. There were jokes about how marketing claims (like “petaflop” performance) can be confusing or misleading. People also debated if it’s really useful for gaming, with most agreeing it’s not a good value for that. In the end, most commenters said the GB10 is a nice, powerful machine, but it’s only worth it for a small group of AI developers who need these special features.

## Show HN: OpenWorkers – Self-hosted Cloudflare workers in Rust

- 原文链接: [Show HN: OpenWorkers – Self-hosted Cloudflare workers in Rust](https://openworkers.com/introducing-openworkers)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46454693)

OpenWorkers is an open-source tool that lets you run Cloudflare Workers on your own servers using Rust. It gives people the same way to write and run serverless code as Cloudflare, but without using Cloudflare’s own servers.

OpenWorkers uses V8 isolates to run JavaScript safely, with limits on CPU time (100ms) and memory (128MB) for each worker. You can use things like KV storage, PostgreSQL, S3/R2 storage, and service bindings, just like on Cloudflare. It supports common web APIs such as fetch, Request, Response, and crypto. The system comes with a built-in scheduler for cron jobs and is fully compatible with Cloudflare Workers’ syntax, so you don’t have to change your code much if you switch. 

The architecture uses Docker Compose and a PostgreSQL database to make setup simple. There’s a dashboard, an API, logging, and several runners for handling requests. The creator started this project seven years ago, first using vm2 for sandboxing, then Deno, and now rebuilt everything in Rust using rusty_v8. The main reasons for building this were to keep data private (it never leaves your servers), to have predictable costs (no per-request fees), and to avoid vendor lock-in.

To run it, you clone the repository, copy the environment file, start Postgres, run migrations, and bring up the rest of the services with Docker Compose. The team plans to add deterministic debugging features next.

In the comment section, some people are excited about avoiding vendor lock-in and keeping data private. Others like that it uses Rust and V8, saying it could be fast and safe. A few users ask how well it matches Cloudflare Workers’ features, wondering if edge functions are as fast and reliable. Some raise questions about possible security risks from running untrusted code, and suggest careful sandboxing and updates. There are comments about whether the setup is simple enough for small teams, while others appreciate the Docker-based approach. Some developers wish for support for more languages, not just JavaScript. A few mention that running your own edge network at scale is still hard, but see this as a good step for private or regional use. Others ask about performance trade-offs and how to monitor or debug running workers. Overall, people like the idea of more open-source options for serverless computing and keeping control of their own infrastructure.

## 2025 Letter

- 原文链接: [2025 Letter](https://danwang.co/2025-letter/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46454413)

Dan Wang writes a long letter about his year, sharing thoughts on Silicon Valley, China, AI, and the world in 2025. He compares the serious, humorless culture of both Silicon Valley tech leaders and the Chinese Communist Party, saying both have big power but lack lightness.

He thinks San Francisco and the Bay Area have changed a lot. Years ago, tech focused on apps and crypto, but now AI is the main thing, and tech has more power in politics. Wang enjoys the Bay Area’s open, merit-based culture, especially for young, skilled people, but he sees it as narrow-minded and self-absorbed. He worries that tech people don’t care enough about the wider world or culture, and that tech’s “herd thinking” means people rarely challenge each other’s ideas.

Wang says tech in San Francisco is fast, curious, and ready to try new things—this helps it create big changes, like new products and ways of living. But he also notes that the city is becoming more closed off, with a culture that’s hard for outsiders to join. He’s uneasy about the influence of groups like effective altruists, who sometimes lose touch with common sense.

He discusses the huge focus on AI, especially fears and hopes about superintelligence. Many in Silicon Valley believe AI could quickly change everything—maybe even destroy humanity. Wang thinks these ideas are too extreme and that they distract from longer-term thinking and practical problems. He doubts any country, including the US, can keep a big lead in AI, since China is close behind and has advantages like more power generation and a big pool of AI talent.

Wang describes China’s tech progress as steady and driven by strong competition, good infrastructure, and a focus on manufacturing. He says China is now leading in many fields (except semiconductors and planes), and companies like Xiaomi move much faster than American firms like Apple. He believes the US often underestimates China, wrongly blaming subsidies or IP theft, and ignores China’s real strengths: its ecosystem of factories and ability to innovate on the factory floor.

He is skeptical that AI or automation alone will save US manufacturing, pointing out that Chinese factories are already more automated and productive. Wang thinks the US needs to learn from China’s industrial strategy and not just hope China will fail due to its own problems.

Wang sees China aiming for self-sufficiency and global strength in manufacturing, while the US risks becoming complacent. He notes that both the US and China face big internal problems, but he is more optimistic about America’s ability to fix its issues. He wants the US to build better infrastructure, public works, and industry, learning from China’s successes, instead of just complaining.

He shifts to personal reflections—his book "Breakneck" did well because of timing, framing, and reaching new audiences. He shares what he learned from readers and from promoting his book, and discusses the value of writing, podcasts, and books in today’s “oral culture.” He reviews several books he read this year, and ends with light thoughts on food and travel.

Top Hacker News comments show a mix of agreement and criticism. Some readers praise Wang’s deep knowledge of China and his balanced view of US-China tech competition. Others feel he is too positive about China’s system or too critical of the US, arguing that China’s problems are bigger than he says. Many agree with Wang that the US needs to improve manufacturing and infrastructure, but some say his suggestions are not detailed enough.

A few commenters focus on Silicon Valley culture, agreeing that it is insular and too quick to believe in AI hype, but others think Wang underestimates tech’s openness and the value of dissent in startups. Some readers point out that Wang’s picture of China’s tech progress misses issues like censorship, brain drain, and lack of creativity. Others say his writing is thoughtful and gives a rare, honest view from someone who knows both the US and China.

Readers argue about whether AI will really change the world as fast as some believe. Some think worries about superintelligence are overblown, while others say it is right to be cautious. There is debate on whether America’s problems are fixable, or if the country will keep falling behind China in tech and industry. Many like Wang’s call to action for the US to learn from other countries, but some are unsure if American culture will ever make such big changes. Overall, the comments show respect for Wang’s insights, even if people disagree with his conclusions.

## iOS allows alternative browser engines in Japan

- 原文链接: [iOS allows alternative browser engines in Japan](https://developer.apple.com/support/alternative-browser-engines-jp/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46453950)

Apple now lets iOS apps in Japan use web browser engines other than WebKit. This change is for full browser apps and for in-app browsing, but only for users in Japan and with many strict rules.  

To use a different engine, developers must first get special permission from Apple. The app must only be available in Japan. Apple will check that these browsers pass most web standards tests, like 90% of Web Platform Tests and 80% of JavaScript Test262 on iOS devices. If the browser does not have JIT (just-in-time) compilation, it still needs to pass these tests. Developers must also prove their browsers are secure, get regular security updates, and fix security problems quickly—usually within 30 days. There are rules for memory safety, using secure languages or features, and keeping third-party code up-to-date. Apps must also respect privacy, such as blocking third-party cookies by default, not sharing device IDs without user consent, and not syncing state between apps unless the user agrees.  

For in-app browsers, only the main company behind a browser engine can apply. The in-app browser must show the URL, have a button to open the main browser, and focus on real web browsing. The app cannot be a default browser. Any browser engine used this way also needs to pass strict web standards and security tests. Updates for the browser engine must be pushed to users within 15 days. 

In the comments, some people are happy about more browser choice and hope this comes to other countries. Others think the rules are too strict and may stop smaller browser makers from joining. A few users point out that Apple’s process still gives it strong control, so in practice, only big companies like Google or Mozilla might be able to meet all the requirements. Some developers like the focus on privacy and security, while others feel these are excuses for Apple to limit real competition. There is debate about whether this will really help users, since most people may not notice or care about the engine inside their browser. Some say this change only happened because of pressure from Japanese regulators, not because Apple wanted it. Others wonder if Apple will make it very hard for new browsers to pass the tests or get approved. A few hope that if this works well in Japan, other places will demand the same freedom. Overall, people see this as a small but important step, but many worry about how open and fair it will really be.

## Python numbers every programmer should know

- 原文链接: [Python numbers every programmer should know](https://mkennedy.codes/posts/python-numbers-every-programmer-should-know/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46454470)

This article lists important speed and memory numbers for Python. It shows how fast or slow common Python actions are, and how much memory Python objects use.

Python uses more memory than many expect. An empty list uses 56 bytes, an empty string uses 41 bytes, and even a small integer uses 28 bytes. Strings grow by about 1 byte per character. Collections like lists, dicts, and sets use more memory as they grow, and using `__slots__` in classes can cut memory use by more than half for many objects. For example, a class with five attributes uses 694 bytes, but the same class with `__slots__` uses only 212 bytes.

Basic operations are very fast. Adding two numbers takes about 19 nanoseconds. Appending an item to a list is about 29 nanoseconds. List comprehensions are about 26% faster than for-loops that append items. Looking up a key in a dict or checking a value in a set is much faster than searching a list—about 200 times faster with 1,000 items. Getting the length of a list, dict, or set is also very quick.

String formatting is fastest with f-strings, but even the slowest method (`.format()`) is still fast. For JSON, the built-in `json` library is slower than alternatives like `orjson` or `msgspec`, which can be 3–8 times faster. When it comes to web frameworks, FastAPI, Starlette, and Litestar are about twice as fast as Flask or Django for returning a simple JSON response.

Reading and writing files is quick for small files but gets slower with size. Pickle is faster than JSON for serializing data. For databases, SQLite is much faster than MongoDB for simple reads and writes, but this can change if network access is involved. Diskcache is also very fast for storing and reading data from disk.

Empty function calls, method calls, and lambdas are all fast. Exceptions are slow only when actually raised. Type checking with `isinstance()` is quick. Async operations (like coroutines and tasks) add overhead, so they should be used only when needed for concurrency.

In the comments, many people liked seeing real numbers and said this helps them understand Python performance much better. Some were surprised at how large Python objects are, especially integers and classes. Others discussed the big difference between list and set/dict performance, and how important it is to choose the right data structure. A few readers pointed out that these numbers can change with Python versions and hardware, but the general patterns are useful.

Some users talked about memory use and suggested that for big programs, using `__slots__` or namedtuples can save a lot of RAM. Others compared the speed of JSON libraries, saying that switching to `orjson` made their apps much faster. There were also questions about web framework tests, and some noted that real-world apps may be slower because of database or network delays.

A few commenters warned not to over-optimize, since Python is already fast enough for many cases, and it’s better to focus on clear code first. Some shared their own benchmarks and said they found similar results. Others liked the comparison to C#, though everyone agreed Python trades some speed for ease of use. A couple of readers gave tips for measuring performance in their own code and thanked the author for sharing all the benchmark scripts.

Overall, the post gave many readers a better sense of what’s fast or slow in Python, and how to write more efficient code without guessing.

## BYD Sells 4.6M Vehicles in 2025, Meets Revised Sales Goal

- 原文链接: [BYD Sells 4.6M Vehicles in 2025, Meets Revised Sales Goal](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-01/byd-sells-4-6-million-vehicles-in-2025-meets-revised-sales-goal)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46454977)

BYD sold 4.6 million vehicles in 2025 and reached its updated sales target for the year. This number means BYD likely sold more electric cars than Tesla and is now the biggest electric vehicle maker in the world. The company’s sales went up by 7.7% from 2024, even though BYD had to lower its sales goal in September because demand was slowing down in China. The article says the Chinese car market looks difficult for 2026, but BYD still met its goal. The company made a public statement about its results and is seen as a leader in electric cars. Many people watch BYD because it grows fast and pushes new technology. The article notes that the sales number is big news for the global car industry. It shows that Chinese companies can compete with the top world brands. There are also worries that the market in China may not grow as fast next year.

People in the comments had mixed feelings. Some are very impressed with BYD’s growth and say it is a sign that Chinese companies are now leading in electric cars. Others think the lowered sales goal is a warning that the market for electric cars in China might be slowing down. A few commenters wonder if BYD’s sales will keep growing or if they will face trouble in the future. Some people compare BYD with Tesla and discuss which company has better technology or business plans. Others say that BYD is good at making cheaper electric cars, which helps them sell more. There are some who worry about quality and if BYD’s cars are as good as other brands. A few commenters talk about how Chinese car makers can sell cars so cheaply in other countries, and if that is fair. Some people think this is just the start and that more Chinese brands will become popular around the world. Others are not sure if BYD can keep winning outside of China. Many agree that the car industry is changing fast because of new technology and strong competition.
