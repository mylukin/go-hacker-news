Hello everyone, this is the 2025-08-01 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have a mix of topics from AI theory and solar power, to fun web projects and stories about fixing software bugs. Let’s get started.

First, let’s talk about “the bitter lesson” in AI. This idea says that, over time, general methods using lots of computation and data end up beating hand-crafted, clever approaches made by humans. The lesson is called “bitter” because it shows that human tricks help at first, but are beaten by brute-force computing. Examples like AlphaGo in Go, and advances in speech and vision, show that scaling up data and compute wins in the long run. The author of the article compares this to other moments in history where humans learned they are not as special as they thought—like learning the Earth is not the center of the universe.

However, the article also asks if there are limits to this lesson. In the real world, many organizations are messy. They have unclear goals, unwritten rules, and data that is often biased or hard to measure. For example, in business, it is hard to define or measure “quality” in a simple way. If you cannot turn your goal into clear data, AI cannot help much. Even tools like OKRs can be gamed or fail to capture what really matters.

The article gives the example of Stockfish, a chess engine that uses smart search and a small neural network, beating bigger brute-force models. This shows that efficient, focused methods can sometimes be more powerful than just using more compute. Also, small and specialized AI models can beat big general ones on certain tasks, and can even run on a phone.

The author finishes by saying the bitter lesson works best when you have clear data and goals, but many real-world problems are too messy. Sometimes, using less compute and more human knowledge is better.

Hacker News comments show both agreement and disagreement. Some people say the bitter lesson changed how they work, while others point out that many real-world problems are too complex for brute-force methods. Clever solutions and human judgment still matter, especially when compute is expensive or data is limited. In areas like business, education, or law, you just cannot measure everything, so hand-crafted systems are needed. Even in games, the best systems now mix human ideas with machine learning. Some readers warn that chasing more compute and data can lead to waste or bad results, especially if your goals or data are not clear. Many people agree: real-world problems need a balance, and the bitter lesson is not always the best way.

Now for something lighter—a website called drawafish.com lets you draw a fish and watch it swim with other people’s fish. You just draw a fish with your mouse or finger, submit it, and it appears in a big virtual tank with fish from other users. Each fish is different, showing everyone’s style. The tank updates in real time, and there is a ranking page where you can vote for your favorite fish. The site is easy to use and does not ask for sign-up or personal details.

People on Hacker News love the idea and say it is relaxing. Many enjoy seeing the creativity of others, and some say it feels like old playful websites from early internet days. Some talk about the simple tech behind it—just HTML, JavaScript, and a bit of server code. There are some worries about spam or bad drawings, but opinions are split on whether to add more features or keep it simple. Some developers are interested in the code and ask if it will be open source. Others joke about seeing funny fish or drawing strange ones. Most people agree it is a nice break from serious tech news.

Next, let’s look at a study on where solar power fights climate change best in the United States. Researchers used computer models and big energy datasets to see which regions get the biggest drop in carbon pollution when solar power is added. They found that adding 15% more solar across the U.S. could cut over 8.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide each year. Places like California, Texas, Florida, the Midwest, and the Southwest get much bigger benefits, while New England and the center of the country see less. There is also a “spillover” effect—solar in one region can help cut pollution in nearby regions. The research can help policymakers and investors decide where solar is most useful.

In the comments, people are happy to see data-driven advice for climate action. Many like the idea that solar’s benefits can help neighbors, not just local areas. Some ask about the costs of building solar and storing energy, and worry about solar’s limits when it is cloudy or at night. Others say that in places where solar is less useful, wind or other clean energy might be better. There are questions about power grids, local land use, and the effect on wildlife. Some hope for more research in other countries. Overall, people agree that smart planning using data is key for both the climate and good investments.

Now, here’s a story about fixing a small but annoying bug in Mintlify’s search. A software engineer noticed that search results showed old or wrong answers as you typed, because old search requests were not stopped. He had told the team about it, but nothing changed. Later, he joined the company and finally fixed the bug himself by adding an AbortController to stop old requests. This made the search work as expected, and he found it very satisfying—like fixing a small thing that has bothered you for a long time. He compares this to George Hotz, who joined Twitter to fix their search.

The article also talks about open source. If the project was open, he could have fixed the bug much earlier. Since it was not, he had to wait until he joined the team. He says small fixes add up and can make a product great.

In the comments, people agree that small issues hurt user experience and should be fixed. Some say it is sad that closed code makes it hard to help. Others praise the author for caring enough to get hired just to fix the bug. There are reminders that open source is powerful, and companies should listen more to outside feedback. Some share their own stories of wanting to fix bugs but lacking access. A few people joke about the lengths developers will go to fix a “paper cut” bug. There are also questions about why it took so long to fix, and notes that not everyone knows tools like AbortController. Many find the story inspiring.

Switching to AI, there is an article about “deep agents.” These are advanced AI agents that can plan and work on complex tasks for a long time. Most agents today just run in a loop, calling tools, which is “shallow.” Deep agents use long, detailed prompts, planning tools like to-do lists, sub agents to split up work, and a file system for sharing information. The author shares an open source package called “deepagents,” making it easy to build your own deep agents.

Comments are mixed. Some readers like the idea and say these features are needed for real-world tasks. Others worry that more complex agents are harder to debug and control. Some want better memory or reasoning, not just prompts and file access. There are concerns about safety when agents can use the file system or spawn many sub agents. Some are excited to try the new tool and hope for more examples. In general, people are both excited and careful about deep agents.

Google has released Deep Think, a new feature in the Gemini app for AI Ultra subscribers and some mathematicians. Deep Think uses advanced AI to solve hard problems by thinking in parallel and spending more time searching for good answers. It is faster than the earlier version that won an IMO gold medal, but now performs at the bronze level for speed. Deep Think explores many ideas at once, combines and improves them, and picks the best answer. It is good for step-by-step projects like coding, planning, or solving tough math problems. You can turn it on in the Gemini app and use it for code execution and search. Google says it is safer and more objective, but sometimes refuses simple requests. More testing is planned with developers and businesses.

People on Hacker News are interested but have mixed feelings. Some are excited, thinking Deep Think could help with research and complex coding. Others don’t like that it is only for paid users. Some think the name is hype, and some question if the model really understands problems or is just better at guessing. There are worries about AI safety and blocking safe questions. Developers want API access, and some are waiting for proof of real progress and more open access.

It is also the start of a new month, so there is a regular Hacker News thread where companies post job openings and job seekers look for work. Many companies are hiring software engineers, data scientists, product managers, and designers, with both remote and in-person jobs on offer. Tech stacks like Python, JavaScript, and AWS are common. Some jobs list salaries and benefits, and a few offer visa sponsorship. In the comments, people ask about roles and remote work, wish for more salary info, and share tips for standing out. There is debate about remote versus in-office jobs, warnings about job scams, and thanks for clear ads. The thread is seen as helpful for both hiring and finding work.

Next, an article discusses using self-signed JWTs to make API authentication easier. Today, getting API keys is a long process—you have to sign up, verify your email, create projects, and look after your keys. The author suggests making your own key pair with a few lines of code, using the jose library. The private key stays safe, and the app makes a JWT when it needs to do something special. The server checks the JWT and decides if the action is allowed. For payments, the API can check if a public key is linked to a paid account. The B2B2C use case is covered too, by letting developers create keys for their own users.

Comments are both excited and cautious. Some love the idea of making API auth easier, while others worry about security—if you lose your private key, someone can fake your identity. Some say the current system is hard because it needs to stop abuse and leaks. Others like making keys themselves and not depending on other people. There are questions about scaling for big companies, and comments that payment handling is still tricky. Some warn that using JWT claims for access can be risky if you make mistakes. The B2B2C key system sounds complex to some, but others are excited by making APIs more open.

Google has changed its plan for old goo.gl short links. Before, all goo.gl links would stop working after August 25, 2025. Now, only links that have not been used since late 2024 will be deactivated. If your goo.gl link works and does not show a warning, it will keep working. If it shows a message about stopping, it will be turned off after August 25. This change is to avoid breaking many old links that people still use. To check your link, just open it.

In the comments, people are glad Google listened and will keep active links working. Others still worry about “link rot,” where old links disappear. Some say you should not trust free short-link services for important things, and suggest using your own domain. Broken links can hurt blog posts, research, or videos. Some thank Google for the warning and a way to check links. Others wish all links would be kept, not just the active ones. There are requests for more open or self-hosted short-link tools. Many people see this as a reminder not to depend on big companies for tools you want to last.

Finally, an article explains why JSON is not a subset of YAML, even though many people think you can just use YAML parsers to read JSON. There are big differences—like YAML sometimes treating “no” as the boolean value false, while JSON sees it as a string. This is called the “Norway Problem.” Also, numbers in scientific notation are handled differently. YAML 1.2 tried to fix this, but only if you start the file with a special line, which most JSON files do not have. So, using YAML parsers for JSON can cause bugs that are hard to find.

In the comments, many agree and share stories of bugs caused by mixing YAML and JSON. YAML’s rules for data types are confusing, and newer libraries try to help, but old tools are still common. Some people prefer JSON because it is less likely to surprise you, while others like YAML’s readability, but warn you must be careful. The Norway Problem is a classic example of YAML’s risks. Most agree: if you have JSON, use a JSON parser.

That’s all for today’s episode. Thank you for listening. We hope these stories give you something to think about, whether you are building AI, drawing fish, fixing bugs, or planning your next project. See you next time on Hacker News Daily Podcast.
