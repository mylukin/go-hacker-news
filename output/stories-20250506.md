- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43901619)

The article "An Appeal to Apple from Anukari" is about a developer's plea to Apple for help with performance issues on Apple silicon macOS devices. The problem lies in the GPU's clock rate management, which affects the performance of Anukari, a 3D Physics Synthesizer used in digital audio workstations. The developer found that the GPU's clock rate doesn't increase as needed, causing latency problems for real-time audio processing. To workaround this, the developer implemented a method called "waste makes haste," tricking the system into increasing the GPU load artificially.

The main issue is that macOS's power management leads to lower GPU clock rates, impacting Anukari's performance. The developer used Apple's Metal profiler to confirm that the problem is linked to the GPU clock rate. While the workaround works on some hardware, it fails on more powerful Apple devices, possibly due to the way these devices handle GPU workloads. The developer suggests solutions like extending audio workgroups to GPUs or providing a real-time option in the Metal API. Game Mode isn't a solution since Anukari runs as a plugin and isn't always fullscreen.
