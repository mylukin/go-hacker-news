Hello everyone, this is the 2026-01-02 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we bring you news and discussion from the tech world, covering topics from content ownership to retro computing, new tools, privacy phones, and more.

We start with an article about POSSE, which stands for “Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere.” The main idea is to put your content on your own website first, and then share copies or links on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, or Mastodon. This way, you have full control over your posts, and if a social media site shuts down or changes its rules, your original content stays safe at your own web address. Sharing links back to your site can also bring people to your main page and help with search rankings. POSSE can be used for blogs, photos, videos, and even code. There are tools and plugins for WordPress, Python, and more, to help with manual or automatic posting. Services like Bridgy and IFTTT are also popular for this purpose.

The article compares POSSE with PESOS, where you post on social media first and then copy to your site, and COPE, which means “Create Once, Publish Everywhere.” POSSE is better because it makes clear which post is the original. The article gives advice for developers on how to set up syndication and handle updates or deletions across platforms.

Looking at Hacker News comments, many people like the idea of owning their content, saying POSSE protects against losing posts and keeps everything in one place. But some point out that setup is hard for normal users due to technical steps or lack of simple tools. Others feel just sharing a link is enough, since preview cards work well on big platforms. There are worries about duplicate content in search engines, but the article says linking back helps solve this. Some wish for simpler guides or easier tools, while others feel social media silos make open sharing hard. Many users agree owning your content is important, but POSSE’s setup is still too complex for most people.

Next, we look at a website that lets you try Unix version 4 from 1973 in your browser, running on an emulated PDP-11/45. This was the first Unix written in C, making it much easier to move between computers. The copy used here was found after 52 years on a magnetic tape at the University of Utah. You can choose old-school terminal colors and use classic commands like ls, ed, and cc. There are demo programs, vintage games, and you can browse the kernel source code. The system is kept very authentic: backspace does not work, and you use # and @ for deleting. Sessions last only 10 minutes of idle time, nothing is saved, and reloading resets everything. There’s even a guestbook and live user stats.

Hacker News users were excited to try this old Unix, enjoying the look into 1970s computing. Some liked running C programs in such a basic environment. Others found it hard without modern features like backspace or man pages. A few shared stories about using PDP-11s or early Unix at school or work. Many saw this as a good learning tool, though some found the quirks frustrating. There was praise for the team who recovered and emulated the software, and many users respected the project’s effort to keep things authentic.

Moving on, we have the monthly Hacker News job thread for January 2026. Here, companies post job openings for software engineers, data scientists, web developers, and more. Many jobs are remote, and some need special skills like AI, machine learning, or cloud systems. Companies range from startups to big tech firms. Most posts include job details, pay range, and how to apply. Freelance and contract roles are also common. Some posts highlight benefits like flexible hours or healthcare, and many encourage people from all backgrounds to apply.

In the comments, users share tips about job searching. Some say it’s best to show real skills, not just a fancy resume. Others warn that some companies do not reply, which can be discouraging. There’s talk about which programming languages are popular, and the growing number of remote jobs. Some users ask about salaries and company reputation, while others thank the community for honest job posts. A few wish there were more jobs for beginners or share their own struggles. Others suggest starting your own company if you can’t find a good job. Overall, the thread is seen as very helpful for job seekers.

Next up is the new Clicks Communicator smartphone, designed for better communication with a physical keyboard and special features. The phone targets people who want a good typing experience and fewer distractions. It has an ergonomic keyboard, quick note and voice features, a fingerprint sensor in the spacebar, and a custom signal LED for important messages. The Message Hub brings all messages to one screen, and you can use keyboard shortcuts for fast actions. The Communicator has a 50MP camera, 24MP front camera, 4,000 mAh battery, and supports 5G, a headphone jack, and a microSD slot. It runs Android 16, promises two years of updates and five years of security fixes, and is sold unlocked with eSIM and nanoSIM support.

Hacker News comments show excitement about the return of physical keyboards, with some users missing devices like BlackBerry. Others worry the phone may be too large or expensive, especially for a niche product. Some wish for more keyboard layouts, like AZERTY or QWERTZ, and discuss battery life. There are questions about long-term updates and support, and opinions about the phone’s retro look. Many like the headphone jack and microSD slot, features missing from many new phones.

Let’s look at TinyTinyTPU, a project that builds a simple TPU-like processor on an FPGA for learning. It uses a 2x2 systolic array, so four small units work together to multiply matrices, a key step in machine learning. TinyTinyTPU can store weights, multiply with inputs, add results, run activation functions, and more. It connects to a computer by UART, and you can test it with Python scripts and even run gesture recognition demos. The whole design uses only about 5% of a cheap FPGA board, and you can build it with standard or open-source tools.

The project is great for learning: you can see how data moves, test each part, and view timing in real time. The code is open, well organized, and comes with tests and setup guides. Hacker News users praise the project’s small, clear design and value for students or new FPGA users. Some like the open-source support and share their own stories making tiny accelerators. There are questions about scaling up and about FPGA toolchains, with some preferring open-source tools over Xilinx Vivado. People appreciate the clear testing and thank the author for sharing a project that’s easy to try.

FracturedJson is a new set of tools to format JSON data in a way that is easy to read but still compact. Standard tools give you minified or pretty-printed JSON, both with problems. FracturedJson keeps small or simple arrays and objects on one line, lines up similar items like a table, and allows several items per line in arrays. You can control nesting, line length, and even keep comments, though comments are not standard in JSON. FracturedJson works as a browser tool, .NET library, JavaScript package, or VS Code extension.

Users on Hacker News say the tool is very helpful for big or complex JSON files. Many like that it can keep comments and makes it easier to compare data or debug problems. Some ask for similar tools for YAML or XML, and others discuss using it in different languages. There are tips about command-line use and some debate about allowing comments in JSON. Most agree FracturedJson is a smart idea and a welcome new approach to JSON formatting.

A university class has started using AI voice agents for oral exams, after noticing students’ homework seemed too perfect—likely written by AI. Now, students talk about their projects and answer case study questions to an AI agent that uses ElevenLabs voices. The agent manages the exam, asks dynamic questions, and grading is done by three AI models—Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT—that review each other for fair grades and feedback. The system is cheap and scales well, but had problems: the AI’s voice was harsh, it asked too many questions too quickly, and sometimes repeated or paraphrased questions in confusing ways. Students had to record themselves during the exam to prevent cheating. Most found the AI oral exam more stressful than a written one, but agreed it tested understanding well. They liked the flexibility to take the exam anywhere but wanted calmer voices and slower pacing.

Hacker News users were split. Some liked the creative use of AI to stop cheating and scale grading. Others worried about stress, fairness, and if AI agents can ever fully replace human judgment. There was debate about privacy, ethics of recording, and if making exams harder to cheat just leads to new types of cheating. Many agreed assessment must adapt to AI, but should still focus on real learning.

IPv6, the next generation of Internet Protocol, is now 30 years old but still not the main way we connect online. It was created because IPv4 addresses were running out, but today less than half of users are on IPv6. One reason is that IPv6 is not backward-compatible, so it is hard to switch. NAT allowed many devices to share one IPv4 address, reducing pressure to move. Changing to IPv6 can be complex and costly, so many companies have not switched. Still, IPv6 allows the internet to grow for mobile, cloud, and smart devices. Some countries use it much more, especially in Asia.

Hacker News comments agree that NAT and other tricks kept IPv4 alive much longer. Some say IPv6’s lack of backward compatibility was a big mistake. Others think it is too complex or poorly designed. Some see IPv6 as a slow success, working where it’s needed, while others debate if we will ever fully move away from IPv4. Many think as IPv4 gets harder or more expensive to use, IPv6 use will grow.

Punkt. has launched the MC03, a new smartphone focused on privacy and user control. Built in Europe with its own AphyOS, the phone has two areas for apps: the Vault for trusted, private apps, and the Wild Web for any app but with strong privacy controls. Proton services provide secure email, calendar, storage, and VPN. The hardware includes a 120Hz OLED screen, removable battery, IP68 water resistance, and a 64MP camera. The phone costs $699 and includes a year of AphyOS service; after that, it’s a monthly fee. Punkt. says this keeps your data safe and not sold for ads.

Hacker News users like the focus on privacy, the removable battery, and sustainable design. Some worry the price and monthly fee are too high, or question if the phone can really be secure if any app can be installed. There are calls for open-source code and proof of the privacy claims. Some want even simpler phones, while others compare it to other privacy devices. Many feel it is a good step, but not yet enough to truly break free from big tech, since most people still need Google or Apple apps.

Finally, there’s a story about someone tracking their personal finances for 10 years using plain text files and Beancount. Each month, they spend about 30-45 minutes downloading bank statements and importing them with a Python script. Their ledger now has over 45,000 lines, covers nearly 10,000 transactions, and is stored in git on their laptop. All data is local, simple, and future-proof. The author wrote helpful importers for German banks and even a book to help beginners.

Commenters praise the author’s discipline and like owning their data with plain text and version control. Some say Beancount is hard to learn at first, but worth it. Others share that they use similar tools, or suggest ways to automate imports. Concerns include the work needed for manual entry and data loss, but many agree local storage is safer than cloud finance apps. Some are curious if Beancount can handle complex needs like investments and taxes. Many thank the author for sharing their experience and resources.

That’s all for today’s Hacker News Daily Podcast. We hope you found these stories interesting and useful. Thank you for listening, and see you next time.
