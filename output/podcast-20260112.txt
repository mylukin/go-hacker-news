Hello everyone, this is the 2026-01-12 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have a full lineup of stories about AI helpers, creative hacks, open source troubles, and some fun tech experiments. Let’s get started.

First, Claude for Mac has a new feature called Cowork. This lets the Claude AI do more than just code—it can help anyone get work done faster. Cowork is now in research preview for users with the Claude Max plan. With Cowork, Claude can access a folder on your computer. It can read, edit, and create files for you. For example, it can tidy your downloads, make a spreadsheet from screenshots, or write a draft using your notes. Cowork feels more like an assistant than a chatbot: you give it tasks, and it works through them, updating you along the way. You can also add connectors for outside info and skills to help with documents or presentations. It even works with Claude in Chrome, so it can do things on the web.

Cowork wants to keep things simple. You don’t need to give extra info or fix results by hand. You can line up tasks, and Claude will do them one by one. You stay in control: you pick folders and connections, and Claude asks before making big changes. But there are risks. Claude could delete files if you’re not careful, and there’s a risk of “prompt injection”—someone tricking Claude with bad instructions from the web. Anthropic says they have safety systems, but users should be careful and start slow. The team wants feedback, and they plan to add Windows support and new safety features.

On Hacker News, some people are excited and say Cowork could save time on boring tasks. Others worry about giving AI access to their files, fearing mistakes or security problems. Some point out the risks of prompt injection and ask if the safety steps are good enough. Developers like that Cowork is useful for more than coding, but some want cross-platform support. There are questions about the Max plan’s price. One person said having Claude as a coworker could help solo workers feel less alone. Some are interested in privacy and audits, and others say trust is key—similar products have failed before. Overall, people are interested but cautious, waiting to see how Cowork does in real life.

Next, let’s talk about TimeCapsuleLLM, a language model trained only on texts from London between 1800 and 1875. The goal is to create an AI that truly uses only historical knowledge and language, not modern ideas or words. The project started small, using old books and writings, and grew to use 15GB of texts. The model writes in a Victorian style and can connect people and events from that time, though it still makes up facts and shows errors from old scans.

To build it, the creator collected and cleaned old texts, made a custom tokenizer, and trained the model from scratch. This is different from fine-tuning a modern AI, because modern AIs still remember modern things. Here, the model only knows what people knew in 1800-1875 London.

In the comments, people found the project interesting and valuable for historians and writers. They liked the idea of removing modern bias, but noted that 1800s texts have their own bias, too. Some asked how much the model truly “understands” and pointed out technical issues like OCR errors. Others wondered if a bigger model would do better, or if the idea could be used for other places and times. Some worried the focus on London leaves out other cultures. A few asked if this could help teach history, by letting students “talk” with an AI from the past.

Now to a fun hack: mailing a letter in the US costs $0.78, but you can buy small items on Amazon for less—and they ship for free. The author found cheap products, like Kool-Aid, a potato, or a can of tomato sauce, all under the cost of a postage stamp. You can add a free gift note, and your friend gets something fun or useful, fast. The author’s family started sending each other random items, which turned into a lively group chat and lots of laughs.

In the comments, people think this is clever and funny. Some wonder if Amazon can keep shipping so cheap, or if this could hurt their business. Others worry about waste from packaging and extra delivery trucks. Some joke about sending potatoes or odd parts to friends, and a few are surprised Amazon sells single lemons or Kool-Aid so cheaply. One warns that some sellers might cancel such small orders, but others say it works. Most see it as a creative way to connect and have fun, but they wonder how long this trick will last.

On a Delta Air Lines flight, a passenger tried to beat the onboard chess bot and found it nearly impossible. The Delta chess bot is much stronger than most people expect—even players with ratings around 1750 or 2000 say they get beaten. The bot seems to use an old chess engine, always making the best moves and never letting players win easily. Many people on flights have the same experience: they get crushed by the bot, some even stop playing out of frustration.

In the comments, many share stories about losing to the Delta chess bot. Some joke that beating it should let you fly the plane, or that the first-class bot must be easier. Even strong players struggle, winning only one out of four or five games. Some want Delta to invite a chess grandmaster to play the bot. People find the bot both annoying and funny, and agree it’s much harder than most free chess bots.

Fabrice Bellard’s new tool, ts_zip, uses a large language model to compress text files much more than normal tools like xz. It works well for text, needs a GPU, and is slower—about 1 MB per second on a top GPU. The model predicts the next word or token, then uses arithmetic coding to compress the data. For a 1 GB text file, ts_zip can shrink it from 213 MB (with xz) to only 135 MB. But it’s still experimental, and file formats may change.

In the comments, people are impressed by the results. Some are amazed that language models can do better than classic algorithms for text. Others point out that ts_zip’s speed and hardware needs make it less practical for daily use right now. Some worry about frequent updates breaking compatibility. There is interest in using the approach for code or logs, and questions about how well it works for other languages. Many praise Fabrice Bellard’s history of great software, and some think this could lead to new ways to compress data in the future.

Next, a serious security problem was found in OpenCode, an open-source AI coding tool. Before version 1.1.10, OpenCode would start a web server on your computer without telling you, with no password or protection. Any website could send commands to it and make your computer do things, like running shell commands or reading files. The problem was made worse by a loose CORS policy.

After version 1.1.10, the server is off by default, but if you turn it on, it’s still not protected by a password. There’s also no clear sign when it’s running. The article gives proof-of-concept commands showing how easy it was to abuse the server. The writer suggests adding authentication, warnings, better documentation, and network security.

On Hacker News, many are shocked by how serious the hole was. Some say it’s unacceptable for any app to start an open server with no password, especially a developer tool. Others say silent fixes are bad because users stay at risk. Some think this kind of mistake is common in new open-source projects, but very dangerous. People say servers should never be open by default, and even with the server off, it should not be possible to turn it on without authentication. There is also talk about the need for better security in all open-source projects.

Now to JavaScript, where the Date object has long been confusing and hard to use. The new Temporal API aims to fix this. Date has strange rules for months and years, weird parsing behavior, and trouble with time zones. It also lets you change a date by accident, causing bugs.

Temporal is different. You use methods like Temporal.Now.plainDateISO() to get today’s date. Temporal gives clear names, handles time zones, and works with durations. When you add a day, it makes a new date, so your old one stays the same. This helps prevent mistakes.

Many readers are happy to see Temporal coming. They say Date has caused them lots of trouble, especially with time zones. Some point out that libraries like Moment.js or date-fns were needed before, but maybe not anymore. A few say date handling will always be tricky, and worry about browser support. Some warn that even Temporal can’t solve everything, like leap seconds. Still, most agree it’s a big step forward.

The next story is about problems in the LLVM project, a big open-source toolchain for compilers. The lead maintainer points out that there are many contributors, but not enough experts to review new code. This slows things down and can let mistakes in. New contributors struggle to find reviewers. The author suggests using automatic reviewer assignment, like Rust does.

LLVM’s code and interfaces change often, which is good for fixing mistakes but hard for downstream projects. Building LLVM takes a long time, especially on slow computers. Continuous integration is flaky, so it’s hard to spot real problems. There’s a lack of end-to-end tests, and the backends for different CPUs are very different, leading to duplication. Compile times are still slow, and there’s no good way to track performance changes. Design issues in LLVM’s IR make optimization hard, and some old bugs are very hard to fix.

In the comments, many agree with the author, saying they have faced the same issues—like slow builds and tricky reviews. Some defend LLVM, saying it’s hard to keep such a big project stable. Others say the review bottleneck is the biggest problem and support automatic assignment. Some want better documentation, more end-to-end tests, and faster builds. There’s debate on the best way forward, but most respect LLVM’s power and agree it could be easier for new developers and downstream users.

Another post is about LAD, an AI helper for SolidWorks, a popular 3D design tool. LAD lets you control SolidWorks using plain English. You can describe what you want, and LAD does it for you. It checks if steps are done right, fixes mistakes, and can use images or documents from old projects. LAD can write custom macros, search help files, and has safety tools like checkpoints and command limits. Recent updates added planning mode and smarter error checking.

In the comments, some are excited, saying this could save time, especially for beginners. Others worry the AI might make mistakes, and you still need to know SolidWorks to catch problems. Developers like the natural language idea but wonder how well LAD understands complex requests. Some ask about privacy and pricing. A few point out that SolidWorks has automation already, but LAD could make things even easier. Others warn that relying too much on AI could make people forget how to use SolidWorks the manual way. Overall, people are interested but want to see real examples.

Our last story is about a parent who made a special TV remote for his 3-year-old son using real floppy disks. He wanted his child to have a simple, hands-on way to pick and play TV shows or music, instead of using confusing modern remotes. Floppy disks were used because they are physical, make fun sounds, and are easy to understand. Each disk holds a small file telling the TV what to play. The system uses Arduino boards to read the disk and send play or pause commands to a Chromecast. The box is made from laser-cut wood, and there are safety features to stop damage.

In the comments, one person said the project might avoid interacting with the child, and worried about technology replacing parenting. Another liked the idea and wanted to try it with mini disks. Some readers see it as a fun, creative way to make tech more physical for kids. Others debate if it’s better to use RFID tags or make the project simpler. Most people respect the technical work and enjoy the idea, even if they have different views on the parenting side.

That’s all for today’s episode. Thank you for listening to Hacker News Daily Podcast. We hope you enjoyed these stories and got some new ideas. See you next time!
