Hello everyone, this is the 2025-07-12 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have a packed show with stories about Chrome adblockers, new laws on online content, the latest AI model, retro computer art, self-hosting tips, a clever new swimming stroke, a new Ghidra extension, and a debate about satellite safety.

Let’s start with Chrome and adblockers. Google recently changed Chrome’s extension system from Manifest V2 to Manifest V3. This move made it much harder for adblockers to do their job, because a key feature called webRequestBlocking was removed. But a clever author found a bug in Chrome that let adblockers work like before, even with MV3. The trick was to use some old JavaScript code still left inside Chrome, which handled extension events for a feature that had been removed years ago. By creating a fake event and adding a special number called a WebView ID, the extension could skip the new checks and block ads. This worked because Chrome forgot to check if the extension was really allowed to do it. The bug was meant for old platform apps, but the code stayed in Chrome. The author reported the bug to Google, who fixed it in Chrome 118, but did not give a reward because it was not a security issue. Many on Hacker News praised the creativity, while others called it an example of how old code can cause big problems. Some said Google is just trying to weaken adblockers for its ad business. There was also debate about Chrome extensions becoming too complex, and whether Google should give rewards for non-security bugs. A few shared similar stories of old code causing surprises, and many were sad that adblockers are getting weaker. Some asked if other browsers have the same problem, and joked that even big companies make silly mistakes.

Next is a serious topic about new US laws around online sexual content. The Supreme Court ruled that states can enforce strict age checks for any online writing or art that includes sex or nudity, even if it is just for adults. Now, writers can be sued or even face criminal charges if a minor can access their work without an ID check. Some state laws are very strict. For example, Tennessee wants anyone with over 33% “harmful” content to use tough age checks, like matching a photo ID and a selfie, and checking every hour. South Dakota’s law is even stricter, punishing a single “bad” paragraph with jail time for repeat offenses. For indie writers, this is almost impossible to follow. They would need to store reader ID data, build expensive systems, and most readers would just leave. The laws cover not just porn, but art, sex education, and books in libraries. They do not stop kids from seeing porn on foreign sites that ignore US laws. The author says parents should use filters and talk to kids, instead of banning everything. Some Hacker News users agree, saying these laws attack free speech and hurt small creators, not big companies. Others call the tech expensive, easy to bypass, and a privacy risk. Some worry the laws will be used to ban LGBT+ content or sex education. A few say parents should take more responsibility, and that the Supreme Court ruling will face more legal challenges. Many think the patchwork of state laws makes it impossible to know what is legal online, and that the real effect will be chilling—people will self-censor or leave the web. Several also noted the irony that violence is okay for minors, but sex is not, and called the laws political moves that will not really protect kids.

Moving on to AI, Moonshot AI has released Kimi K2, a new open-source large language model with 1 trillion parameters and a mixture-of-experts design. Kimi K2 is trained for smart reasoning, coding, and tool use. There are two versions: Kimi-K2-Base for research, and Kimi-K2-Instruct for chat and agent tasks. It uses 32 billion active parameters per use, trained on 15.5 trillion tokens, and supports up to 128,000 tokens in its context. A new optimizer called Muon helps with stable training. Kimi K2 outperforms many open models, and even some closed ones like GPT-4, in coding and math tests. It can also call tools from chat, and is easy to run on engines like vLLM. The weights and code are under a modified MIT license. On Hacker News, some are excited by the size and performance, while others say only 32 billion parameters are used each time, so the trillion number is mostly for show. Some developers like the tool-calling and API support, but warn that running Kimi K2 at home still needs lots of GPU power. Others want more details on the training data and the license restrictions. There is also talk about the lack of English resources, since most support is in Chinese. Overall, people are happy to see a large open model, but want more transparency and tests.

Now for something nostalgic. An article shared beautiful MacPaint art from the 1980s, found by searching over 18,000 images on Discmaster. MacPaint, the old Mac drawing program, used only black and white on a tiny screen, but artists made amazing drawings, cartoons, and logos. Some images copied famous people or scenes, while others were original. The author wonders what the artists are doing now, and plans to look at Amiga art next. He suggests searching Discmaster for more old art and mentions a book, “Zen & The Art of The Macintosh,” for tips on making this kind of art. In the comments, many people shared strong memories of early computer art. Some were amazed at the skill needed to draw with just pixels and a mouse. Others compared MacPaint and Amiga art, and shared tips for viewing old images today. One said simple tools help creativity, because you have to think differently. Some wished they could contact the original artists. The comments show a lot of love and respect for early digital art and the people who made it.

Next, a practical guide: hosting a web service at home using Cloudflare Tunnel. This tool lets you make your home server public without opening ports or messing with your router. Your server connects out to Cloudflare, so your home IP stays hidden and safe. You need a Cloudflare account and domain, then install cloudflared, log in, and create a tunnel. You make a config file to tell cloudflared which service to share, set it up as a systemd service, and add a DNS record for your subdomain. In minutes, your local site is live and protected. The article has full commands and tips. In the comments, users like how easy and safe Cloudflare Tunnel is, even behind routers or with dynamic IPs. They remind us to keep web servers secure, since Cloudflare cannot fix bad apps. For bigger use, check Cloudflare’s rules. Some like using one tunnel for many services, while others ask about privacy—Cloudflare sees your traffic, but it is encrypted. Most say performance is good for normal use, and share stories about using tunnels for home automation or company apps. Many agree this is a great tool for indie hackers and hobbyists.

Now for something different—the “fish kick,” a new swimming move that might be the fastest way to swim underwater. The fish kick copies how fish move, with the swimmer on their side, waving their body in a smooth motion. This is different from the dolphin kick, where you move up and down. Swimming underwater is faster because there are no waves to slow you down. In the 1980s, swimmers started staying under longer, so rules now say you must come up after 15 meters. Misty Hyman’s coach tried turning her sideways, and tests with food dye showed big whirlpools that seemed to push her forward better. Some scientists think the fish kick is faster because the sideways kicks make better vortices. But it is hard to learn and control direction. In the comments, people enjoyed the science and shared their own swimming stories. Some asked if the fish kick is allowed in races, and if regular people can use it. Others said it is cool that swimming still finds new ideas, unlike running. Some joked about trying it and failing, just like the writer. Overall, people liked learning about the fish kick and how we are still discovering new ways to move in water.

Next, we have GhidrAssistMCP, a new extension for Ghidra, the reverse engineering tool. This plugin lets AI tools and other programs talk to Ghidra using the MCP protocol. It sets up a server inside Ghidra, with 31 built-in tools for listing functions, analyzing code, and more. You can manage which tools are active, and see logs of requests and responses. Setup is easy: download the zip, add it as an extension, and turn on the server. You can control it through a panel, and even add your own custom tools. The extension uses good software practices and is open source under the MIT license. In the comments, users are happy that it is now easier for AI and automation tools to work with Ghidra, making reverse engineering faster. Some warn about security risks, since opening a server can be dangerous if not protected. Others like that scripting Ghidra from outside is now easier. Some want more documentation and usage examples, and there are questions about automating malware analysis. There are also warnings to check compatibility with new Ghidra releases. Overall, people see this as a big step forward for automation in reverse engineering.

Finally, a story about space safety. The US government wants to stop funding TraCCS, a program that gives free, clear satellite tracking data to help prevent crashes in space. There are now almost 12,000 satellites, and the Department of Defense can’t handle all the data. TraCCS was built to make space safer, but its $55 million budget is now on the chopping block. Experts say this is a bad idea. TraCCS is like the FAA for space, making sure everyone uses the same data. If private companies take over, each may use its own system, causing confusion and more risk. Other countries already provide free tracking. Cutting TraCCS could make US companies less competitive and force them to use foreign services. Over 400 companies wrote to Congress to save TraCCS, saying private firms cannot cover all needs. If the program ends, the military would take over again, but might hide some data. The decision is not final, and the space industry is fighting to keep it. In the comments, some say giving the job to private companies could be good, but most argue that safety needs a single, trusted system. Some worry about job loss and lower wages, while others are frustrated with government spending choices. Overall, the debate is about trusting business versus keeping safety under public control.
