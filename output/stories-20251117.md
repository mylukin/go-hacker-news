## Compiling Ruby to Machine Language

- 原文链接: [Compiling Ruby to Machine Language](https://patshaughnessy.net/2025/11/17/compiling-ruby-to-machine-language)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45957629)

This article explains how Ruby code can be turned into machine language using new technology in Ruby 3.x. The writer looks closely at YJIT, a new type of JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler, and also talks about ZJIT, which may come next.

When Ruby runs, it usually uses an interpreter, which reads and runs code line by line. YJIT changes this by counting how many times each function or block is called. If a block is called many times—more than 30 times in small programs—YJIT will turn this part of Ruby code into machine language. This helps Ruby run faster because the computer can understand machine language directly.

YJIT keeps a counter called jit_entry_calls for every block or function. When the counter reaches the set limit, YJIT compiles the Ruby instructions (called YARV instructions) into machine language. This machine code is stored in something called a YJIT block. Each YJIT block holds instructions for a small part of the Ruby code. One Ruby function can have several YJIT blocks.

For example, if there is a line in Ruby that adds two numbers, YJIT will first see what kind of values are being added. It needs to check if they are integers, strings, or something else, because adding different types needs different machine instructions. YJIT waits to see what happens when the code runs. It uses a “branch stub”—a placeholder that lets it decide later what kind of machine code to use, based on what the program actually does.

YJIT’s way of turning Ruby into machine language is flexible and fast. It does not need to know everything ahead of time. It just watches the program, waits until something is used a lot, and then makes special machine code for that case. This helps Ruby programs run much faster, especially those that repeat the same code many times.

In the Hacker News comments, many readers are excited to see Ruby’s performance improving. Some developers praise YJIT for making Ruby more useful for big and fast web applications. Others are interested in the technical details, like how YJIT counts calls and uses branch stubs to wait for more information. One commenter points out that this is similar to how other languages like JavaScript use JITs to get faster.

A few people worry about the extra complexity JITs add to Ruby. They ask if it will be harder to fix bugs or understand why code runs slow. Some want to know how much faster Ruby really gets in real-world programs, not just small tests. Another view is that more speed could make Ruby popular again for new projects.

Some developers share their own stories about trying YJIT and seeing better speed, while others ask if this will help Ruby on Rails, the popular web framework. A few are curious about ZJIT, the next JIT mentioned in the article, and wonder how it will be different. Lastly, there are questions about how easy it is to change the call threshold, and what happens if a program’s behavior changes after the code is compiled.

## Show HN: I built a synth for my daughter

- 原文链接: [Show HN: I built a synth for my daughter](https://bitsnpieces.dev/posts/a-synth-for-my-daughter/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45900425)

This article is about a parent who built a simple, child-friendly synthesizer (synth) as a birthday gift for their three-year-old daughter. The synth is a portable step-sequencer with sliders to control musical notes, made to be fun and easy for young children.

The synth has four sliders, each controlling one note in a four-step loop. Sliding up makes a higher note, sliding down makes a lower one. It includes a built-in synth module and speaker, with controls for tempo, volume, scale, pitch, and instrument. An OLED screen shows visual feedback and a dancing panda. The case is custom-made with a 3D printer, and the electronic parts are mounted on a printed circuit board (PCB).

The idea started when the author saw how much their daughter enjoyed using a Montessori activity board with knobs and switches. Wanting to make something musical, they learned about microcontrollers, CAD design, PCB design, and 3D printing from scratch. They began with an old Arduino kit, building a simple MIDI controller on a breadboard. Using an Arduino MIDI library, they sent note data to their computer, playing sounds in music software.

Next, they added a small synth module and moved sound generation onto the device itself. After that, they connected an OLED screen for feedback, using a graphics library, but ran into problems with slow screen updates. The dancing panda animation was a fun touch but made updates laggy at higher speeds.

To make building and testing easier, they used Wokwi, an online microcontroller simulator. When the basic circuit was working, they designed a custom enclosure using Fusion 360, a CAD tool, and printed it on a friend’s 3D printer. The first version was wired by hand, which made it fragile, so they designed a simple PCB for sturdiness and easier assembly. Powering the device required some tweaks—batteries alone didn’t give enough voltage, so they added a boost converter for reliable performance.

The final version included a neat battery compartment and a stable PCB mount. The synth is now a regular toy in their daughter’s collection and is holding up well. The author hopes it will stay interesting as she grows, and is considering improvements like a better screen and a more advanced microcontroller. They also think the idea could become a real product, but note that making and selling hardware is hard due to safety rules, manufacturing costs, and certification fees.

In the comment section, many people praise the project for being creative, educational, and a great parent-child gift. Some say it’s a good way to introduce kids to music and electronics. Others share their own experiences with DIY toys, and how building things for children can bring joy and learning.

A few commenters offer technical advice, like using other microcontrollers for better performance or suggesting different power options. Some point out that selling children’s toys is tricky because of safety laws and high costs for testing and certification. Others suggest open-sourcing the design, so makers can build their own versions without big business risks.

There are also questions about how the synth sounds, and requests for demo videos. Some developers say they would buy a kit if one becomes available. Others talk about the fun of making hardware projects, and how it teaches patience and problem-solving.

A few caution that making and shipping hardware is much harder than software, especially for small batches, and suggest starting with a small run or crowdfunding campaign. Some share tips for making enclosures more robust or for simplifying the design to make it cheaper and easier to assemble.

Overall, the response is positive, with many people inspired by the story and interested in following the project’s next steps.

- 原文链接: [Show HN: PrinceJS – 19,200 req/s Bun framework in 2.8 kB (built by a 13yo)](https://princejs.vercel.app)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45957402)

A 13-year-old developer built a web framework called PrinceJS that runs on Bun and can handle 19,200 requests per second. The framework is very small, only 2.8 kilobytes, and is meant to be super fast and simple.

PrinceJS was made to show how much you can do with only a little code. The developer wanted to make something tiny but powerful, so PrinceJS can serve web pages quickly and handle a lot of users at once. The framework uses Bun, which is a new JavaScript runtime known for speed and modern features. PrinceJS has things you expect in a web framework, like routing (choosing what code runs for each kind of web request), and it tries to keep things easy to use.

The main selling point is speed. PrinceJS claims 19,200 requests per second, which is much faster than most Node.js frameworks of the same size. The code is open source, so anyone can look at how it works or use it in their own projects. The small size means it loads fast and does not use much memory. The creator says they wanted to learn about servers and coding by building something real and useful. The website shows some code examples and explains how to get started.

In the Hacker News comments, many people are impressed that such a young developer built this. Some say it is cool to see kids making real software, and they hope the developer keeps learning. Others focus on the technical side, asking how the 19,200 requests per second were measured, and if the test was fair compared to bigger frameworks. Some users note that Bun is still new, so they wonder about stability and how well it works in production. A few ask if PrinceJS has more features, like middleware or support for more complex apps. Others share tips on writing even faster code or making the framework safer. There are also people curious if frameworks need to be this small, or if bigger code is okay when it helps developers work faster. Overall, the comments are supportive and interested, with some helpful advice and thoughtful questions about web frameworks and learning to code.

## My stages of learning to be a socially normal person

- 原文链接: [My stages of learning to be a socially normal person](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/my-six-stages-of-learning-to-be-a)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45937302)

This article is about someone who learned how to be more socially normal over many years. The writer was often awkward and lonely as a child and young adult, and social skills did not come naturally.

He explains that learning social skills was not a straight line. First, he tried to be interesting and smart, copying the style of radio hosts and writers he admired. He learned poems, read difficult books, and told dramatic stories. This made some people like him, but most found him tiring or strange, and he still felt left out.

His big change started while working in restaurants. At first, he was too formal and talked in long paragraphs, which did not work with customers or coworkers. He watched other servers and saw that the best ones would match the style of the people they were serving—sometimes serious, sometimes playful. He learned to be flexible, to respond to people, not just perform for them.

Later, he met a server who was very odd but well-loved. This person broke the normal rules and made people feel relaxed by acting silly or saying strange things. The writer tried this himself—acting a little awkward or odd on purpose—and it helped people connect with him more easily.

He realized that being open, playful, and responding to what others wanted in the moment was much better than trying to impress them. He also learned to pay attention to body language and feelings, not just words. After some time meditating and working on himself, he found he could connect deeply with people just by being present and listening.

However, he noticed that being very open and warm with everyone could cause problems. Some people would get too attached or confused, thinking he wanted a closer relationship. He learned to balance his openness and to let others lead the level of connection.

In the end, he feels he can now have both deep and light conversations, and is comfortable being alone or with others. He believes he is finally socially normal.

In the comments, many people say they relate to his journey. Some say they also learned social skills step by step, often starting out awkward. Others point out that there is no single way to be “normal,” and that different groups value different kinds of social behavior.

Some comments warn that acting too open or quirky can be risky in some situations, or may not work for everyone. A few people say they wish more people would talk about how hard it can be to learn social skills as an adult. Others note that reading people’s non-verbal signals is very important, and not everyone can do it easily.

Some readers think the author’s approach is clever and brave, while others suggest that being “normal” is not the real goal—being kind and authentic might be more important. There are also comments about how social skills can be learned like any other skill, with practice, and that it is okay to make mistakes along the way.

Overall, people appreciate the honesty of the article and share their own stories of feeling out of place and working to fit in. Some give tips or mention books that helped them. Many thank the writer for showing that change is possible, even if it takes time.

## Project Gemini

- 原文链接: [Project Gemini](https://geminiprotocol.net/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45954640)

Project Gemini is a new internet technology that lets people share and read simple text documents online. The idea is not about making something completely new, but about going back to basics and making the internet simple and safe again.

Gemini is like a small, quiet library on the internet. It supports plain text documents linked together, much like the early web or Gopher. There are no ads, no tracking, and no big images or videos—just text. The main goal is to protect users’ privacy and save bandwidth. The creators say they’re not trying to replace the web or “disrupt” anything. They want to give people a break from the busy, loud, and sometimes unsafe modern web. Anyone can build tools or websites for Gemini, and there is a growing list of software and resources on their website. All the official content is free to share, but not for selling or changing.

In the comments, many people like the idea of a simple, quiet web. Some say it reminds them of the early days of the internet, when everything was easier to use. Others think Gemini is great for old computers or slow internet, where big websites don’t work well. Some users point out that Gemini is good for privacy, because it does not use cookies or track users.

However, there are also people who think Gemini is too simple. They say it will never replace the modern web because most people want images, videos, and interactive sites. Some worry that it is too hard for normal users to use, since you need special software to visit Gemini sites. Others feel that the web is already too big and complex, and it’s hard to get people to try something new like Gemini. Still, a few people think it’s a fun project that shows what the web could have been if it stayed small and simple. Some developers talk about building their own Gemini tools or writing blogs with it, just for fun or learning. In the end, most agree that Gemini will stay a small community, but it is a good reminder that the internet doesn’t have to be complicated.

## Show HN: ESPectre – Motion detection based on Wi-Fi spectre analysis

- 原文链接: [Show HN: ESPectre – Motion detection based on Wi-Fi spectre analysis](https://github.com/francescopace/espectre)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45953977)

ESPectre is a project that lets you detect motion in your home using only Wi-Fi signals, not cameras or microphones. It works with a cheap ESP32-S3 device and connects to Home Assistant for smart home automation.

The idea is simple: when someone moves, they change the way Wi-Fi waves travel between your router and the sensor. The ESP32-S3 listens to these changes using something called Channel State Information (CSI) and figures out if there is movement. You don’t need any special router—almost any 2.4GHz Wi-Fi router will do. The setup costs about €10 for hardware and takes around 30–45 minutes, with all software being free and open source.

ESPectre does not use machine learning. Instead, it uses math and statistics to look at 10 different features from the Wi-Fi signal. This makes it work fast and right out of the box, with no need to train models. These features also mean you could add machine learning later for more advanced uses, like counting people, or knowing if someone sat down or waved their hand.

The sensor can “see” through walls, so you don’t have to worry about line of sight. It’s private because there are no pictures or sounds, just anonymous signal data. You can use it for home security, to check if an elderly person has moved, turn lights on or off, or save energy in empty rooms. Placement is important: put the sensor 3–8 meters from your router, at about table height, and not behind big metal objects or in corners.

The system uses MQTT to send motion data to Home Assistant or any MQTT server, so you can have one or many sensors in your house. Each sensor can watch a different room, and you can create smart rules based on where movement happens.

Many people on Hacker News liked the project for its low cost, privacy, and clever use of existing Wi-Fi. Some think it’s great for home automation, especially where cameras are not wanted. Others are curious if it can tell the difference between people and pets, but right now it just senses any movement. Several users wonder about accuracy, and point out that the system needs careful tuning for each room and may not work as well in places with lots of Wi-Fi noise or thick concrete walls. A few users are excited about the future, when Wi-Fi standards like 802.11bf will make these features easier and more common in new routers.

Some commenters raise privacy concerns, warning that even though no personal info is collected, it could be used to track people without their consent. The project author stresses the importance of using it responsibly and getting permission from everyone in the house. Others mention that, with more work and machine learning, this kind of tech could soon tell the difference between people, pets, and maybe even recognize activities or gestures. Some are already thinking about using it for elderly care, security, or smart lights, while others are just impressed you can do all this with a €10 device and some clever software. Overall, the community sees ESPectre as a fun, practical project with lots of promise for the future.

## FreeMDU: Open-source Miele appliance diagnostic tools

- 原文链接: [FreeMDU: Open-source Miele appliance diagnostic tools](https://github.com/medusalix/FreeMDU)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45953452)

This article is about FreeMDU, an open-source project that lets people talk to Miele appliances using their hidden optical diagnostic interface. The official Miele tools for this are expensive and only for service techs, but FreeMDU is free and open for anyone.

Most Miele appliances made after 1996 have an infrared interface behind a light or a label marked “PC.” Before FreeMDU, you needed to buy Miele’s special adapter and use their closed software to talk to your appliance. FreeMDU gives you both software and hardware tools, so you can check, test, or even connect your appliance to smart home systems. The project has three main parts: a protocol library, a terminal app for diagnostics, and firmware that works with home automation (like Home Assistant). The project is still experimental, so there’s a risk you could damage your appliance if you’re not careful.

Some devices are already supported, but support depends on a “software ID.” There’s a list of confirmed working models and instructions for how to try adding support for new ones. To use FreeMDU, you need the Rust programming language, plus you’ll have to build a hardware adapter. After that, you can run the diagnostics, connect to Home Assistant, or make your own custom tools. The project is not connected to Miele and is under open licenses (Apache and MIT), so anyone can use or help improve it.

In the comments, many people are excited to see open hardware and software for appliances. Some users say this is great because it helps owners fix their own stuff, not just rely on official repair techs. Others warn about the risk of breaking your appliance if you use these tools without understanding what you’re doing. People also discuss how companies like Miele make it hard for users to access diagnostics, and wonder why more manufacturers don’t open up these interfaces. Some think this project could help keep old appliances running longer, which is good for the environment. A few users talk about the technical side, like how tricky it is to reverse-engineer the protocols and build the hardware. There are questions about which models work and if this might inspire similar projects for other brands. Some commenters share stories about trying to fix their own appliances and why having open tools would have made things much easier. A few people also point out that using these tools might void your warranty, so you should be careful. Overall, most comments are positive and hope this inspires more open tools for all kinds of devices.

## Insects on the Space Menu

- 原文链接: [Insects on the Space Menu](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/Insects_on_the_space_menu)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45901560)

This article is about the European Space Agency studying if insects can be used as food for astronauts during long space missions. The idea is that insects are light, tough, and full of good nutrition, so they might be a good food source in space.

Many people on Earth already eat insects—over two thousand kinds are part of human diets around the world. Insects can turn things people cannot eat into protein, and they can grow well even in hard conditions. The article explains that fruit flies were the first animals to survive a trip to space back in 1947. Since then, scientists have sent many types of insects, like ants and bees, to space to see how they do. Most insects can survive and grow in microgravity, though some have trouble moving or reproducing.

Insects are also good for recycling waste and making food in a way that does not harm the environment. They are high in protein, healthy fats, iron, and vitamins, sometimes even more than meat or fish. Crickets and mealworms are common choices because they are easy to raise and now allowed as food in Europe. Astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti even took a cereal bar made with cricket flour on her mission.

However, scientists do not know everything yet. Most insect experiments in space were short and old. Many did not last long enough to see an insect’s whole life cycle. Now, ESA wants to run new tests to see if insects can live, grow, and reproduce in space for longer times.

People in the comments had mixed feelings. Some thought eating bugs in space makes sense because they are easy to grow and pack a lot of nutrition into a small space. Others said that many people might not like the idea of eating insects, even if it is practical. A few pointed out that astronauts need variety and comfort food for mental health, and bugs might not be enough. Some users shared that cricket flour or insect protein tastes fine, especially when mixed in other foods. Others worried about allergies or the challenges of raising insects in a closed space station. A few joked about “space bugs” and wondered about the psychological side of eating insects. Some people said we should try this on Earth first, to get used to it, before sending it to space. Others thought this research could help solve food problems on Earth too. Overall, the comments showed both excitement and hesitation about bugs on the space menu.

Google has released WeatherNext 2, a new AI model for better and faster weather forecasting. This tool can quickly predict many possible weather outcomes and is now available for use by developers and businesses. WeatherNext 2 uses a special type of AI called a Functional Generative Network, which helps it make hundreds of forecasts in less than a minute using only one computer chip. It can predict important weather details like temperature, wind, and humidity with higher accuracy than older models. The model is also very detailed, giving updates as often as every hour for up to 15 days in advance. It is now part of Google’s products like Search, Gemini, Pixel Weather, and Google Maps. WeatherNext 2 is also open for early use in Earth Engine, BigQuery, and Vertex AI, making it easier for others to build on top of it. The model helps not just with normal forecasts, but also with important planning for events like storms or power production. The technology works by letting the AI learn from simple weather facts and then combine them to understand bigger weather systems. Google says this new approach should help people, researchers, and companies make smarter weather decisions. They plan to keep improving the model with more data and features.

In the Hacker News comments, some people are excited about how fast and powerful WeatherNext 2 is, saying it might change how we plan for weather risks. Others are curious about how well it works in places with less weather data, and whether it can really help predict rare or extreme events. A few users worry about trust, asking if the AI’s predictions can be explained or checked, since weather can be a matter of safety. Some comment that traditional weather models use physics and wonder if AI can match their accuracy for big storms. Others like that Google is sharing the model and data with the public and hope open access will speed up more research. There are questions about how much energy it takes to run these AI models, but some point out that it seems more efficient than older supercomputer-based forecasts. A few people ask how much Google’s tools will cost to use in the future. Some users mention wanting to see more models like this from other groups, not just Google. There is also excitement about how this technology could help farmers, airlines, or disaster response teams. Finally, some hope these AI models will be used together with traditional science for the best results.
