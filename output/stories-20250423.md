## Pixel is a unit of length and area

- 原文链接: [Pixel is a unit of length and area](https://www.nayuki.io/page/pixel-is-a-unit-of-length-and-area)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43769478)

The article discusses how the term "pixel" can be confusing because it's used to describe both length and area in digital images. For example, a screen might be 1920 pixels wide (a length), but a camera could have 12 megapixels (an area). This creates a contradiction when you try to apply mathematical logic, as multiplying lengths should give you an area in square pixels, which isn't how it's commonly described.

The article suggests two ways to resolve this confusion. One is to define a pixel as a square with a variable size depending on the device, and introduce a new term, "pixel-side," for its dimensions. Another approach is to insist pixels are a unit of length and refer to areas strictly as "square pixels," though both solutions have their issues.

Commenters on Hacker News had diverse opinions. Some argued that pixels are indivisible units, similar to counting apples, rather than measuring length or area. Others noted that digital images and displays often treat pixels as small squares, especially in contexts like anti-aliasing or subpixel rendering, where the physical arrangement matters. Some pointed out that the term "pixel" can be context-dependent, varying between cameras, screens, and software.

Others mentioned how the concept of pixels as point samples is crucial in certain fields like image processing, but this doesn't always align with physical representations, where pixels can be rectangular or even non-square. The discussion highlighted the complexity and varied understanding of what a pixel represents, depending on the specific technical or practical context.
