Hello everyone, this is the 2025-10-03 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have two interesting stories to share with you.

First, we look at TrueVault, a startup that helps online stores follow data privacy laws more easily. TrueVault is hiring a Business Development Representative, but they want someone special: a person who has been an eCommerce Manager at a Direct-To-Consumer brand. The idea is that people with real eCommerce experience know the daily problems of running an online store, so they can connect better with potential customers. The job is about reaching out to other brands, showing how TrueVault’s software can make privacy compliance simple, and setting up meetings for the sales team. The work includes writing emails, making calls, using social media, and working closely with the team. This is a remote job, but only for people living in the US.

To apply, you need at least two years of eCommerce Manager experience, good writing and talking skills, and you must send your resume as a PDF plus a sample sales email to a real company. The pay is $100,000 total, with $70,000 base and up to $30,000 in bonuses. There’s also full health insurance for your family, unlimited time off, 401k, HSA, and company equity. High performers can get promoted within 12 to 18 months. TrueVault promises to keep your data private when you apply.

On Hacker News, commenters liked that TrueVault wants real eCommerce experience, not just sales skills. Some said this is rare but smart, because it helps build trust with customers. There were questions about the pay, with a few people thinking $100,000 might not be enough for someone with this background, especially in expensive US cities. Others pointed out that moving from eCommerce management to SaaS sales could be tough, but it might be a good chance for career growth. Some also liked the focus on privacy and hope more companies will offer tools like this. There were questions about privacy compliance challenges for small shops and curiosity about the company’s product and customer base. Overall, many people thought this is a good opportunity for someone who wants to move from operations into tech sales.

Our second story is about a creative hardware project: turning a Lego Game Boy set into a real, working Game Boy. The builder knows Game Boy circuit boards well and decided to try this project after making a joke online. They picked the Game Boy Pocket CPU instead of the original Game Boy CPU, because it is cheaper, easier to find, and has VRAM inside the chip, saving space. This matters because the Lego kit does not have much room inside. Using press photos and careful measurements, they planned how to fit the real Game Boy parts into the Lego shell. The main electronics will sit behind the Lego screen window.

The builder designed a special power circuit and used a soft-latching power button for easier use. For the buttons and USB-C port, they made custom 3D-printed Lego-like pieces. The Lego buttons can be pressed and are wired to work as real Game Boy controls. The builder shared photos and videos showing the process, including the “clicky” feel of the buttons. The project is not finished yet, but they plan to release all the details when it is done.

Hacker News readers were impressed. Many loved the mix of Lego and real electronics, calling it a dream project for fans of both hobbies. Some asked technical questions, such as how the buttons work and if the screen would look good behind the Lego window. Others worried about fitting everything in such a small space. People thought that using the Game Boy Pocket CPU was a smart choice for space and cost reasons. A few shared similar projects, like putting Raspberry Pi computers into Lego cases. There was also discussion about open-source hardware and how sharing detailed documentation can help others try similar builds. Some people joked about what Lego and Nintendo would think of the idea. Overall, the comments were supportive and excited to see more updates.

That’s all for today’s episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Thank you for listening. We’ll be back tomorrow with more news and stories from the world of tech.
