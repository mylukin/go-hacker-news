North Dakota passed a new law to help develop critical minerals, but the law includes two fake minerals named “friezium” and “stralium.” These names appear to come from the last names of two coal industry lawyers, Christopher Friez and David Straley, who worked on the bill. The lawyers say they did not add the fake names, and no one knows who did. Some people think it was a joke, a mistake, or maybe someone wanted to embarrass the lawyers. The Agriculture Commissioner found the fake minerals while preparing for a meeting and said it could be embarrassing for the state. The fake minerals were added late, just before the bill passed when lawmakers were rushing. The main sponsor, Rep. Dick Anderson, said he didn’t add them and wishes he had checked better. Staff who prepare the laws said they just use what lawmakers send them and are not experts in minerals. Earlier, another fake mineral, “docterium,” named after another lawmaker, was caught and removed before the bill passed. The president of the coal industry group said this was an unfortunate mistake but that the main goal of developing real critical minerals is very important.

People in the comments had mixed reactions. Some found the story funny and were surprised that fake names made it into a real law. Others saw this as a sign that lawmakers do not always read or understand what they are voting on, which worries them. There was talk about how easy it is for mistakes or jokes to end up in official documents when work is rushed. Some pointed out that this shows why careful review is important before passing new laws. A few users wondered if this kind of thing happens more often than people know. Others felt embarrassed for North Dakota and said it could make the state look bad. Some thought it was just harmless fun, while others thought it showed bigger problems in government. Finally, a few joked that “friezium” and “stralium” should now be real elements in the periodic table.

## Show HN: Terminal UI for AWS

- 原文链接: [Show HN: Terminal UI for AWS](https://github.com/huseyinbabal/taws)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46491749)

This project is a tool called "taws" that lets you view and manage AWS resources from your terminal. It gives a fast, keyboard-driven way to browse things like EC2, Lambda, S3, and many other AWS services without using the web console.

The main idea is to make AWS work feel more like using tools such as Vim or k9s for Kubernetes, but for AWS. Taws supports switching between different AWS profiles and regions easily. You can work with over 94 resource types from 60+ AWS services, like starting or stopping EC2 instances straight from the terminal. The tool gives real-time updates, and you can refresh views with a single key. Navigation uses keys like "j" and "k" to move up and down, and ":" to pick resource types. You can filter resources by name, view details in JSON or YAML, and use autocomplete to find things quickly. 

It is easy to install on macOS, Linux, or Windows, with pre-built binaries or using Cargo if you have Rust. You need to have your AWS credentials set up, and your account must have enough permissions to see the resources. The README shows key bindings, supported services, and how to configure the tool. If you need a service that is not supported, you can ask for it to be added. The project is inspired by k9s and built with Rust libraries.

In the comments, some people are excited about having a fast, terminal-based way to manage AWS, saying it feels less heavy than the web console. Others wish there were more tools like this for cloud platforms, and they like the Vim-style navigation. A few point out that tools like this are great for people who live in the terminal and want to avoid using a mouse. Some mention similar tools, like "aws-nuke" or "aws-tui," and compare features. One person warns about being careful with commands that can destroy resources, suggesting a "confirm" step for dangerous actions. Another asks about security and if it supports session tokens or MFA. There are questions about extending support to more AWS services. A few users mention that while this is great for individuals, many companies still use strict permissions and may not allow such tools, but others say it’s great for small teams and indie hackers. Overall, people are positive and interested to see the project grow.

## Claude Code On-the-Go

- 原文链接: [Claude Code On-the-Go](https://granda.org/en/2026/01/02/claude-code-on-the-go/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46491486)

This article explains how the writer codes from their phone using six Claude Code agents, without needing a laptop or desktop. They use Termius on iOS and connect to a cloud virtual machine (VM) for all their coding work.

The writer rents a Vultr VM and only pays when they use it, about $0.29 per hour. They have scripts to start and stop the VM easily. The VM doesn’t allow public SSH; it uses Tailscale for private, secure access. More security comes from a cloud firewall, local firewall rules, and fail2ban.

For connecting, they use Termius (an SSH app) and mosh (a tool that keeps the session alive even if the network changes). They work in tmux, which means all their sessions stay open if the app is closed or the network drops. Each Claude agent runs in its own tmux window, so the writer can work on multiple features at once.

They also set up push notifications. When Claude needs input, a script sends a message to their phone, so they know when to respond. This means they don’t need to stare at the terminal all the time—they can walk away and come back when needed.

The VM is kept safe: it’s isolated from production systems and doesn’t store important secrets. The cost is limited, so even if something goes wrong, the most they lose is a day’s VM fee. The setup supports parallel development, using git worktrees and different ports for each feature branch.

This allows the writer to code anywhere: while waiting for coffee, on the train, or while watching TV. They start tasks, do other things, get notified, and reply—all from their phone.

In the comments, people are impressed with the clever use of mobile and cloud tools. Some praise the security choices, like using Tailscale and firewalls. Others point out that mosh and tmux are great for keeping mobile sessions alive. A few ask about battery life and typing speed on a phone, saying it might be hard to do serious work without a real keyboard. There are questions about the cost—some think $7 a day is good for flexible work, while others wish for even cheaper options.

Some worry about trusting Claude with code changes, but agree the VM isolation helps. A few hackers share their own setups, like coding on iPads or with portable keyboards. Others wonder if this could work for larger teams, or if it’s best for solo developers. Many like the push notification trick, saying it helps make async work feel smooth.

Overall, readers find the approach interesting, practical, and a good example of remote, flexible coding in action.

## I changed my personality in six weeks

- 原文链接: [I changed my personality in six weeks](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20260102-how-i-changed-my-personality-in-six-weeks)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46491623)

This article is about a writer who tried to change their personality in just six weeks, using ideas from new psychology research. The main focus is on whether it is possible to shift traits like being more outgoing or less anxious through simple, daily actions.

The writer starts by explaining they are very neurotic—often nervous and worried—and have been this way for a long time. They take a personality test based on the “Big Five” model, which measures openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Their scores show high neuroticism and openness, strong conscientiousness, average agreeableness, and low extraversion. Research used to say personality is fixed by age 30, but new studies show people can change traits, sometimes quickly, if they try. The writer reads about recent experiments where people improved traits like extraversion, agreeableness, and reduced neuroticism by doing weekly challenges for a few months. Inspired, the writer tries activities like daily meditation, gratitude journaling, meeting new people, being kinder, and relaxing perfectionist habits.

Some activities feel awkward at first, like starting small talk or saying positive things instead of negative ones. Going to social events is hard in the beginning but gets easier over time. Meditation is especially helpful, calming the writer’s busy mind. By the end of six weeks, they feel more sociable and less anxious. When they retake the personality test, their extraversion and agreeableness scores go up, and neuroticism drops a lot. Their partner, who did not try to change, stays the same. The writer notes that real change is possible, but it may depend on wanting to change and putting in effort.

Hacker News commenters have mixed reactions. Some are impressed that research now supports the idea of changing personality and like the “fake it till you make it” approach. Others are skeptical, saying that six weeks is too short and test results might just reflect a good mood or recent events, not real change. A few point out that personality tests are not always reliable and can be affected by how you feel that day. Many agree that small, daily actions—like talking to strangers or keeping a journal—can really help people grow. Some share their own stories of becoming less shy or anxious over time by pushing themselves into new situations. There is debate about how much of personality is “hardwired” versus shaped by experience. Some users say lasting change is slow and takes years, while others believe that even small improvements can make life better. A few warn that trying too hard to change might cause stress or make someone act inauthentic. Overall, most commenters think being open to change and trying new things is a good idea, even if results are not huge or fast.

## Lessons from 14 Years at Google

- 原文链接: [Lessons from 14 Years at Google](https://addyosmani.com/blog/21-lessons/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46488819)

This article shares 21 lessons from 14 years working as a software engineer at Google. The main idea is that being a great engineer is not just about writing code—it’s also about working well with people, understanding users, and learning from mistakes.

The author says the best engineers are focused on solving real user problems, not just using cool technology. Working together is more important than always being right. It’s better to start simple and ship your work, even if it’s not perfect. Clear and simple code is better than clever code, because other people will need to understand it later. Only use new and fancy tools when you really need them, because they add extra work in the future.

Your code does not speak for you—people do, so make sure others know about your impact. Sometimes, the best code is the code you never write. At a big company, even your bugs can become features if users depend on them. If a team is slow, it’s usually because people are not aligned, not because they are lazy or lack skills. Focus on what you can control, and don’t worry too much about things you can’t change.

Abstractions and layers of code do not remove complexity—they just hide it, and you need to know how things work underneath. Teaching others helps you learn better yourself. “Glue work,” like documentation and helping others, is important but can be invisible, so try to make it noticeable. Winning every argument can cause silent resistance from your team. Metrics can be gamed, so use more than one to get a real picture.

Admitting what you don’t know creates a safer team. Your network and relationships at work are more valuable than any single job. Most speed improvements come from removing extra work, not making things more clever. Good processes help reduce risk, not create paperwork. As you get older, time becomes more important than money. There are no shortcuts to learning, but small improvements add up over time.

In the comments, many people agree that these lessons are important, especially for engineers moving from junior to senior roles. Some readers say that the advice about focusing on people and communication is the hardest to learn, but also the most valuable. Others point out the lesson about only using new technology when needed, saying that too much novelty causes problems later. A few commenters disagree, saying that sometimes innovation is worth the risk if it brings big rewards.

Several users like the idea that being clear is better than being clever, and that writing code for others to understand is a sign of maturity. Some share stories about how they made mistakes early in their career by trying to be the smartest in the room, and now focus more on teamwork. Others mention that “glue work” is often overlooked in promotions, and wish companies would reward it more.

A few people discuss the point about metrics, sharing examples of how chasing the wrong numbers led to bad results. There are also comments about the value of building a network, with some saying that their best job offers came from old connections. Finally, some readers say that admitting what you don’t know is freeing, and helps teams grow stronger together. Overall, the comments show a mix of agreement, reflection, and some challenges to the advice, but most find the lessons helpful and honest.

## Why does a least squares fit appear to have a bias when applied to simple data?

- 原文链接: [Why does a least squares fit appear to have a bias when applied to simple data?](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/674129/why-does-a-linear-least-squares-fit-appear-to-have-a-bias-when-applied-to-simple)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46491821)

This article looks at why a linear least squares fit (like a simple regression line) can look “off” or “biased” when you use it on some data. The writer noticed that the line from a least squares fit does not always pass through the middle of a cloud of points, even though you might expect it to.

The main point is that ordinary least squares (OLS) regression tries to make the vertical distances between the data points and the line as small as possible. This means it only cares about errors in the y-direction, not the x-direction. The line will always go through the average point (mean x, mean y), but it may not follow the main direction where the data spreads out the most.

The article compares this to using the eigenvector of the covariance matrix (like in principal component analysis, or PCA). This eigenvector points in the direction where the data shows the biggest spread. If you draw a line along this direction, it often looks more “central” to the data cloud.

But OLS and PCA are doing different things. OLS gives the best guess for y if you know x, while PCA is about the overall shape of the data. There’s also “total least squares” (TLS) or “orthogonal regression,” which treats errors in both x and y. This method usually gives a line closer to the main axis of the data cloud, matching what people often expect.

Examples in the answers show that the OLS line and the PCA (or TLS) line are only the same if the data is perfectly straight (correlation is 1 or -1), or if the spread in x and y is the same. Otherwise, the lines are different.

People in the comments have a few different views. Some point out that OLS is supposed to work this way; it’s not really “biased”—it just does what it’s designed for. Others say our brains like to see the “main axis” as the best fit, which is why the OLS line can look wrong to us. Some suggest using total least squares or Deming regression if you want a line that fits the overall data shape, not just y given x.

A few users explain that OLS does not care about where the most points are—it only minimizes squared errors. Others add that if you fit x as a function of y, you would get another line, and both lines cross at the mean point, but neither matches the “main axis” unless the data is very special. People also discuss that OLS is popular because it is simple and matches many real-world problems where x is not noisy, but sometimes you need a more symmetric method.

In short, the “bias” is not a bug, but a feature of how OLS works. If you want a line that matches your visual sense of the data’s direction, you should look at total least squares or PCA methods.

## Eurostar AI vulnerability: when a chatbot goes off the rails

- 原文链接: [Eurostar AI vulnerability: when a chatbot goes off the rails](https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/eurostar-ai-vulnerability-when-a-chatbot-goes-off-the-rails/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46492063)

This article talks about security problems found in Eurostar’s public AI chatbot. The writer used the chatbot as a normal customer, then tested it because the AI’s answers seemed controlled by rules, not just the model.

The main points are about how the chatbot works and where it failed. The chatbot uses a REST API, sending the whole conversation history with every new message. The server checks only the newest message with a “guardrail” for safety but does not re-check older messages. If the latest message passes, it gets a special signature; if not, it returns a fixed, polite refusal. However, the server does not check if older messages were changed or if the chat and message IDs are correct.

The writer found four main problems:
1. It was possible to bypass the guardrails by making the last message harmless and changing earlier messages to do something bad.
2. With prompt injection, someone could get the system to reveal secret prompts or details about the AI model.
3. The chatbot would show any HTML it received, so an attacker could make it run code in the user’s browser (self-XSS).
4. The server accepted any chat or message IDs, even simple fake ones, without checking.

None of these problems allowed access to other users’ data (as far as tested), but they could become more dangerous if the chatbot is given more power in the future.

Reporting these issues was hard. The researcher used Eurostar’s official email, but got no answer for weeks. When they reached out on LinkedIn, Eurostar told them to use the same process that had not worked. Later, Eurostar even suggested the researchers were blackmailing them, although no threats were made. The problems were finally fixed, but the process was slow and confusing.

In the comments, some people say this is a classic example of old web security mistakes showing up in new AI tools. They point out that adding AI does not remove the need for basic checks like input validation and server-side controls. Others are surprised that companies still miss these basics, even after years of web security advice. Some commenters think the guardrail design was too trusting of the client and let users tamper with chat history. A few developers share similar stories of vulnerability disclosure going badly or being ignored by companies. 

Some readers defend Eurostar a bit, saying it’s hard to manage security as products change quickly, and that outsourcing disclosure programs can cause confusion. Others remind everyone that if the chatbot ever handled personal data, these bugs could have been very serious. Many agree that companies should treat AI features just like any other part of their website—do the basics well and test often. Finally, a few people note how important it is for companies to have clear, working channels for security reports and to respond quickly and politely.

## Street Fighter II, the World Warrier (2021)

- 原文链接: [Street Fighter II, the World Warrier (2021)](https://fabiensanglard.net/sf2_warrier/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46488278)

This article is about a famous mistake in the game Street Fighter II: the subtitle “World Warrior” was misspelled as “World Warrier” right before the game was shipped. The author tells how the main graphics designer, Akiman, found this error too late—the graphics chip (GFX ROM) was already made, so the art could not be changed in the usual way.

Akiman could still change how the game displayed things using the code, but not the actual pictures. He tried to cover up the mistake by layering other pieces of art (sprites) on top of the wrong letter to make the “e” look like an “o.” He noticed there was already an “or” in the word “World,” so he borrowed those tiles and swapped them in for the last part of “Warrier,” making the title read “Warrlor.”

This fixed part of the problem, but now the “l” looked wrong—it was supposed to be an “i.” Akiman needed a way to add a dot on top of the “l” to make it look like an “i,” but the hardware did not let him draw new things. He found a clever trick using a small piece of another character’s sprite—Guile’s leg—which had just one pixel. By using the right color palette, he placed this tiny tile over the “l” to make a dot, finishing the fix.

This is why, for years, the “i” in “Warrior” looked a bit strange in the logo. Later versions of Street Fighter II fixed the art, but the subtitle was changed anyway, so the new tiles were never really used.

In the comments, some readers were impressed by how creative the solution was, saying it showed real problem-solving skills under pressure. Others joked about how many people must have seen the title and not noticed the odd-looking “i.” Some said they work in games and know how last-minute fixes like this are part of the job. A few wondered why nobody caught the typo earlier, while others pointed out that hardware limits in old games often led to these kinds of clever workarounds. Some readers shared similar stories from their own projects, and a few discussed how small mistakes can become famous over time. A couple of people also expressed respect for the attention to detail and the effort to fix even small errors, even when time was short. Some said this story made them appreciate the art and effort behind classic games even more.

## Linear Address Spaces: Unsafe at any speed

- 原文链接: [Linear Address Spaces: Unsafe at any speed](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3534854)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46442282)

This article talks about how modern computers use linear address spaces and why this design is now a problem. The writer explains that while old computers used simple, straight memory spaces, new systems keep adding layers and fixes to stay compatible, making things much more complex and slow.

The author starts with his experience on new CPUs like Apple’s M1 and IBM’s s390x, noting how every new generation adds more “extensions” and “buffers.” This makes the original, clean design hard to see and work with. Both ARM and x86 CPUs suffer from this, especially when translating virtual addresses to physical ones. Modern systems use many levels of page tables, which makes memory access slower and can cause strange errors, like double faults.

The reason for linear address spaces is mostly history—early computers needed them, and we keep using them for compatibility. But now, most operating systems build more abstract object storage systems on top of this anyway. The translation from virtual to physical addresses is now so complex that it sometimes takes five memory reads just to find out where data lives.

The author gives an example from history: the Rational R1000 computer. It used a different system, where memory was an object cache, not a linear space. Each memory address was really an (object + offset) pair, and the hardware handled types and data together. This made things fast and safe, even with 64-bit addresses, and the design was used in defense systems.

He then talks about new ideas like CHERI, a project from ARM and Cambridge University. CHERI makes pointers and integers different in hardware, so you can’t turn data into an address by mistake. This would have prevented about 43% of Microsoft’s reported security problems in 2019. The author says that linear address spaces are unsafe and that we need hardware protections like CHERI, or even better, a return to object-based memory like the R1000.

In the comments, some people agree that modern memory management is too complex and risky. They like the idea of object-based memory and hardware-enforced safety. Others think that changing to new memory models is too hard because of all the old software that expects linear addresses. Some point out that object-based systems have their own problems, like making debugging and low-level programming more difficult. A few mention that while ideas like CHERI are good for safety, they might slow down programs or make hardware more expensive.

Several readers discuss how much of this is due to the need for backward compatibility. They say that most users don’t care about these details as long as their programs work. Some believe that strong software tools and safe programming languages would solve most problems, so changing hardware isn’t needed. Others worry that adding more hardware safety could lead to new kinds of bugs or security issues if not done carefully.

Overall, the discussion shows that many people want better, safer memory systems, but they also see big challenges in making such a big change to how computers work.

## The Unbearable Joy of Sitting Alone in a Café

- 原文链接: [The Unbearable Joy of Sitting Alone in a Café](https://candost.blog/the-unbearable-joy-of-sitting-alone-in-a-cafe/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46488355)

This article talks about the quiet happiness of sitting alone in a café without any phone, laptop, or other distractions. The writer spends some days just walking with their dog and then sitting in a café, trying to slow down and enjoy the moment.

Instead of using a phone or computer, the writer chooses to leave devices at home. At first, they feel nervous and anxious but soon start to feel free. They realize that not being able to contact anyone or look things up helps their mind relax. They notice how often they reach for their phone out of habit and find it funny each time it’s not there.

Drinking coffee slowly from a porcelain cup, rather than a paper one in a rush, feels like a special treat. The writer pays attention to the café’s sounds, the people, and even the staff’s routines. They start to see details they never noticed before, like how people worry or how the staff talks to regular customers.

Sitting alone also makes the writer think about how we can’t control what others think about us. Sometimes, the writer wonders if the staff sees them as a regular or just a person with a dog. Being alone in public can feel scary, but it can also be powerful—others may be curious or even a bit jealous of this quiet joy.

The writer also tries writing by hand in the café. Using a pen and paper, instead of typing, forces them to slow down even more. It feels challenging but rewarding.

In the Hacker News comments, many people share their love for sitting alone in cafés. Some say it’s a great way to relax and watch life happen. Others talk about how hard it is to disconnect from phones, but agree it’s worth it. A few mention feeling self-conscious at first, but getting used to it over time.

Some users point out that cafés are not just for groups—many people go alone to read, think, or just enjoy the atmosphere. Others say that being alone in a public place can make them feel connected to the world, even without talking to anyone.

A few comments mention that in some cultures, sitting alone in a café is normal and not strange at all. Some people like to write or draw while sitting alone, just like the author. Others say they miss this kind of slow, peaceful time because their lives are so busy.

A handful of users worry about being judged or seen as lonely, but most agree that it’s a small price to pay for the joy of quiet and reflection. Some even say they have made friends or met interesting people while sitting alone in a café.

Overall, the comments show that many people value quiet time alone, even in busy places, and that being “alone” does not always mean being lonely.
