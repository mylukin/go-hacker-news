## Show HN: Terminal UI for AWS

- 原文链接: [Show HN: Terminal UI for AWS](https://github.com/huseyinbabal/taws)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46491749)

This project is a tool called “taws,” which gives you a terminal user interface to view and manage AWS resources. The goal is to make it easier for people to see and control their AWS infrastructure from the command line, without needing to use the AWS web console.

With taws, you can switch between different AWS profiles and regions quickly. It supports more than 94 types of resources across 60+ AWS services, like EC2, S3, Lambda, and many more. The interface updates in real time, and you can refresh your view with one key. The navigation is keyboard-driven, using keys similar to Vim, so you can move up and down, filter lists, and open detailed views easily. For EC2, you can start, stop, or terminate instances right from the terminal. Resource details can be seen in JSON or YAML formats. There is autocomplete and fuzzy matching to help you find the resource type you want. Installation is simple, with Homebrew, direct downloads for different systems, Cargo, or from source with Rust. 

To use taws, you need AWS credentials and some basic IAM permissions (like Describe* and List*). The tool reads credentials from standard places like the AWS CLI or environment variables. Switching profiles or regions is just a keypress away. There are also helpful key bindings for common actions, and a help screen is available. The tool is inspired by k9s (for Kubernetes) and uses the Ratatui Rust library for the interface.

In the Hacker News comments, people like the idea of a terminal UI for AWS. Some compare it to k9s and say they have wanted something like this for AWS for a long time. A few mention that AWS’s own CLI and web interface can be slow or hard to use, so this tool could save time for experienced users. Some users are happy that it is written in Rust and open source. Others discuss security, making sure you do not give the tool more permissions than needed. There are questions about support for more services and features, and some wish for even more actions, like editing resources. A few users compare taws to other tools, like AWS Console on the browser, and say a terminal UI could fit better into their workflow. Some worry about the learning curve for Vim keys, but others like the speed and control this brings. Finally, there are ideas for future improvements and thanks to the author for sharing the project.

## Why does a least squares fit appear to have a bias when applied to simple data?

- 原文链接: [Why does a least squares fit appear to have a bias when applied to simple data?](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/674129/why-does-a-linear-least-squares-fit-appear-to-have-a-bias-when-applied-to-simple)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46491821)

The article asks why a least squares fit, which is a way to draw the best straight line through some points, seems to be biased when used on simple data. It points out that sometimes, even with clean data and a good method, the line doesn’t go exactly where you think it should.

The main idea is that least squares tries to make all the squared distances from the points to the line as small as possible. But this method can seem to "pull" the line in a certain direction, especially if there are not many points, or if the data is spread out in a certain way. The article talks about how least squares assumes the errors are only in the y-direction (up and down), not in the x-direction (sideways). If your data has errors in both directions, or if the points are not lined up well, the fitted line can look off.

It also explains that with very few points—like just two or three—the line you get can be very sensitive to where those points are. If you add more points, the fit usually gets better and less biased. There are also other ways to fit a line, like "total least squares," which does consider errors in both directions, but the usual least squares doesn’t.

Some people think the bias is just part of the math, while others say it shows up because real data is messier than the math expects. The article says using more data and checking your method can help.

In the comments, some people agree that least squares works best when errors are only in the y-direction. Others say this method is used so much because it is simple and fast, even if it is not perfect. A few mention that in real life, data often has errors in both directions, so sometimes a different method is better.

One person points out that with small samples, random chance can make the fit look biased, but this goes away with more data. Another comment says the bias is not "wrong"—it is just a result of how the method works. Some users discuss using different fitting methods for different problems, and a few give code examples to show the difference.

A few people think most users do not notice the bias unless they look closely. Others say the bias can matter a lot in science or engineering, so it’s important to understand it. Some users remind others to check their data and method before trusting a fitted line.

## Eurostar AI vulnerability: When a chatbot goes off the rails

- 原文链接: [Eurostar AI vulnerability: When a chatbot goes off the rails](https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/eurostar-ai-vulnerability-when-a-chatbot-goes-off-the-rails/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46492063)

This article talks about security problems found in Eurostar’s public AI chatbot. A researcher found four main issues: guardrail bypass, prompt injection, HTML injection, and weak checks on conversation and message IDs.

The chatbot uses an API to handle all chat messages. Each time you send a message, the full chat history goes to the server. There is a guardrail system that checks if your latest message is safe. If it is, the server signs it and lets it through; if not, you get a fixed refusal message. Only the latest message is checked, so you can change earlier messages and trick the system. This means you could put harmful instructions in the chat history for the chatbot to follow, even if the guardrail blocks your newest message.

The researcher showed how you could use this to leak private prompts, learn which AI model is used, and even inject HTML code into the chat. If you put special code, the chatbot may output it as real HTML, leading to self-XSS attacks. Also, the server did not verify message or conversation IDs, so you could use any value, which could let attackers replay or share dangerous payloads.

The problems were reported to Eurostar, but the process was slow and confusing. Emails went unanswered, the company changed its reporting system, and at one point, they suggested the researcher was trying to blackmail them—though no threats were made. Eventually, Eurostar fixed the problems.

The article ends with advice: treat AI chatbots like any other web app—validate all input and output, never trust user data, sign all important parts, and keep logs. Staff should also be trained to know AI answers are not always safe or correct. Regular testing and updates are important to keep things secure.

In the Hacker News comments, some people said these mistakes are common in new AI products. Many agreed that web security basics are still needed, even with AI. A few were surprised that old tricks like XSS and ID replay still work on modern sites. Some felt Eurostar handled the report badly, and that companies need better bug reporting systems. One commenter pointed out that guardrails must be enforced on the server, not just the client. Others wondered if these problems could happen on other sites using similar chatbots. A few shared stories about companies ignoring bug reports or treating security researchers poorly. There were also comments about how AI makes old problems worse by making it easier to inject prompts or code. Some liked the advice to log everything and teach staff about AI risks. In the end, most agreed that “AI” is not magic—you still need to follow normal security rules.

## Linear Address Spaces: Unsafe at any speed (2022)

- 原文链接: [Linear Address Spaces: Unsafe at any speed (2022)](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3534854)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46442282)

This article talks about linear address spaces in computer systems and says they are risky. Linear address space means all data in memory is put in one big line, with each part having its own address. The author explains that this design is simple and lets programs use memory in a straight, easy way. But, there are big problems. If a program has a bug, it can change data anywhere in memory, sometimes by accident. This can cause crashes or let hackers take control. The article says modern computers try to stop this with things like memory protection, but the basic idea is still unsafe. The author gives examples of famous bugs, like buffer overflows, that happen because of linear memory. They also say new computer languages and systems try to make memory safer, but they are not perfect.

In the comments, some people agree and say they have seen many bugs caused by this problem. Others think linear memory is okay if programmers are careful. A few say computers use this design because it is fast and simple, even if it has risks. Some point out that safer memory systems are slower or harder to use. Others talk about new languages like Rust, which help stop memory bugs. A few people wish old systems could be fixed, but most say it is too late because too many programs use linear memory. Some developers share stories about hard-to-find bugs in their own code. Others say better tools and testing can help, even if the memory model is not perfect. A few worry about security, while others focus on speed. Most agree that memory safety is a hard problem with no easy answer.

## The Unbearable Joy of Sitting Alone in a Café

- 原文链接: [The Unbearable Joy of Sitting Alone in a Café](https://candost.blog/the-unbearable-joy-of-sitting-alone-in-a-cafe/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46488355)

This article is about the special feeling of sitting alone in a café, without any phone or laptop. The writer wanted to slow down and enjoy life during a break from work.

He noticed that cafés are made for groups, not for people alone, but he chose to visit by himself. Instead of traveling like his friends, he stayed in his city, walked his dog, and tried to live slowly. He left his phone at home, which made him nervous at first, but soon he felt free. Without his phone, he couldn't check messages or look things up. He just sat, drank coffee, and let his mind wander.

He found joy in simple things: sipping coffee from a real cup, listening to sounds in the café, and watching people. He realized that, when you slow down, you notice more about others—their faces, their eyes, and even their worries. Sitting quietly, he started thinking about his own life and mistakes but learned not to worry about the past.

Every day, he visited the café, sometimes at his favorite table, sometimes closer to the staff. He began to notice how the staff worked and wondered if they saw him as a regular customer or just a strange man with a dog. He understood that you can't control what others think about you, and that’s okay.

After a few days, he took longer walks instead of going to the café, but always returned. He saw that being alone in public can look strange to others, but it can feel powerful and joyful. Sometimes, he saw other people sitting alone too, and realized he was not the only one who enjoyed this. In the end, he brought a notebook and pen, writing by hand to slow down even more.

In the comment section, some people agreed that sitting alone in a café is peaceful and helps them think clearly. Others said they feel nervous or uncomfortable doing it, because it seems strange to be alone in public. A few shared that they bring books, notepads, or just watch people, and enjoy the quiet time away from screens.

Some commenters pointed out that, in some countries, it’s normal for people to sit alone in cafés, while in others, it feels odd. Others talked about how hard it is to leave their phone behind, but those who tried it said it helped them feel more relaxed. A few people worried about taking up space in busy cafés, but many said that most cafés welcome solo customers.

There were also stories about making friends or having small talks with staff or other regulars, just by visiting often. Some said they even do their best thinking and writing alone in cafés. Others wondered if the feeling of being alone is really about missing technology, or about missing connection with people. Overall, most commenters agreed that taking time for yourself in a café, without distractions, can be a simple but powerful joy.

## Street Fighter II, the World Warrier (2021)

- 原文链接: [Street Fighter II, the World Warrier (2021)](https://fabiensanglard.net/sf2_warrier/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46488278)

This article talks about a funny mistake in the old video game Street Fighter II. The designer, Akiman, made a typo and wrote “World Warrier” instead of “World Warrior” just before the game was finished. The problem was hard to fix because the art for the logo was already burned into the arcade hardware’s graphics memory, so they could not simply change the letters.

To solve this, Akiman used a clever trick. He looked for ways to use existing tiles—the small images used to build graphics in the game—to cover up the mistake. He took parts from other letters in the logo, like using “or” from “World” to cover “ier” in “Warrier.” But this made another small problem: now the word looked like “Warrlor” instead, because the “l” did not look like an “i.”

To fix the “l” and make it look like an “i,” Akiman used a special tile from another character, Guile. This tile was almost all transparent, except for one pixel. By drawing this pixel in just the right spot and using the logo’s color palette, he made a small dot above the “l,” turning it into an “i.” This was a smart use of the hardware’s limited graphics abilities.

The article explains that in later versions of the game, they fixed the logo with new art. But by then, the subtitle “World Warrior” was not used anymore, as the game’s name changed in updates.

In the comments, many people were surprised at how much work went into fixing such a small mistake. Some said it was impressive how Akiman used the tools and hardware in creative ways. Others pointed out that small details like this show how much game development used to rely on clever problem-solving. A few readers remembered seeing the strange-looking “i” in the game and now finally understood why it looked odd.

Some commenters discussed how hardware limits forced developers to think differently and sometimes led to cool tricks. One person joked about how typos can happen to anyone, even in big games. Another mentioned that today’s games are easier to fix with updates, but back then, everything had to be perfect before shipping. Some readers shared their own stories about last-minute fixes in their projects. A few people wished more technical details were given, while others just enjoyed the story. Overall, most agreed that this was a fun look at game history and how small mistakes can have interesting fixes.

## The Year of the 3D Printed Miniature (and Other Lies We Tell Ourselves)

- 原文链接: [The Year of the 3D Printed Miniature (and Other Lies We Tell Ourselves)](https://matduggan.com/the-year-of-the-3d-printed-miniature-and-other-lies-we-tell-ourselves/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46422574)

This article talks about why 3D printing did not change the world of Warhammer and tabletop miniatures, even though many people in tech said it would. The writer explains that, for years, tech fans have predicted that new tools like 3D printers would “disrupt” old hobbies, but these predictions often miss the real reasons people enjoy these activities.

The main story is about Warhammer 40,000, a popular tabletop wargame. Players spend a lot of money and time building and painting small plastic soldiers. Many tech people thought 3D printers would let players print their own miniatures at home, making the official, expensive models from Games Workshop unnecessary. But this has not happened.

The article explains why. First, using a 3D printer is much harder than it sounds. Printing even one miniature takes hours and requires special chemicals, safety gear, and a lot of space. It’s not as simple as pressing a button. After printing, you still need to paint the miniatures, which takes many more hours—often more than 150 for a whole army. Most players find painting and learning game rules to be the real time investment, not just buying the models.

Also, people like using the official models because they feel special and part of the hobby’s tradition. Game shops do not want to display or sell unofficial, 3D-printed models. Players want to show their best work, and this usually means using real models, not copies. The article says that the real joy of the hobby is in the time spent building, painting, and playing with others, not just owning the plastic.

In the comments, many people agree that tech predictions often fail to understand real users. Some say that 3D printing is great for some things, but not for everything, especially when the fun comes from the process, not the product. Others point out that 3D-printed miniatures are helpful for proxies or hard-to-find pieces, but most players still want the real thing.

A few commenters share their own stories about trying 3D printing. They mention problems with the mess, noise, and chemicals. Some say that even with cheaper, better printers, it’s still too much work for most people. Others note that Games Workshop is still making a lot of money, and the hobby is strong—3D printing did not hurt it.

Several people talk about how tech often sees everything as something to “disrupt,” but forgets why people do hobbies in the first place. Some say it’s the same with other hobbies, like vinyl records or cooking. One person jokes that the real problem is the pile of unpainted miniatures, not how to get more.

There are also comments about local game shops. These shops depend on selling official products and card games, not just miniatures, so 3D printing would not fit their business. A few people think 3D printing might play a bigger role in the future, but most agree it’s just one tool, not a replacement for the whole hobby.

Overall, commenters say that understanding people’s feelings and the “why” behind a hobby is more important than just looking at costs or new tech. The hobby is about community, creativity, and fun—not just plastic.

## Millennium Challenge: A corrupted military exercise and its legacy (2015)

- 原文链接: [Millennium Challenge: A corrupted military exercise and its legacy (2015)](https://warontherocks.com/2015/11/millennium-challenge-the-real-story-of-a-corrupted-military-exercise-and-its-legacy/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46493623)

This article is about Millennium Challenge 2002, a huge military war game that turned into a scandal when it was revealed the results were rigged to make sure the U.S. side won. The exercise was supposed to test new war strategies and technologies, costing $250 million and involving thousands of people.

At first, the “red team,” led by retired Marine general Paul Van Riper, used clever surprise attacks and sank most of the U.S. fleet in minutes. This shocked everyone. But after that, the game’s organizers, called the “white cell,” changed the rules so the blue team (the U.S. side) could win. They stopped the red team from using real tactics, made them put their defenses in the open, and even told them they could not shoot at certain planes. Van Riper was angry and quit as red team leader, saying the test was fake and only meant to prove what the Pentagon wanted.

The official report was kept secret for years, but later admitted the game was heavily scripted after the red team’s early success. The article explains that both sides came in with their own goals: the Pentagon wanted to show off new technology, while Van Riper wanted to prove that real enemies would not fight as the U.S. expected. In the end, many people learned important lessons about planning and testing, especially about the value of honest “red teaming”—thinking like the enemy to find weaknesses. But the military leadership did not want to hear bad news and tried to cover up the problems.

In the comment section, some readers think the military wasted money and missed a chance to learn from its mistakes. Others say these kinds of exercises are always influenced by politics and should not be taken too seriously. A few people defend the exercise, saying even a flawed test is better than none, and at least some lessons were learned. Several commenters point out that real-life wars are messy and unpredictable, so war games should try to be as realistic as possible. There are jokes about PowerPoint being a dangerous weapon in the Pentagon. Some discuss how the U.S. often underestimates creative tactics from opponents. Others debate whether the military has changed its approach since then, with some hopeful and others doubtful. A few mention the importance of whistleblowers like Van Riper, while some warn that such people are often ignored or punished. Overall, most commenters agree that honest feedback, not scripted victories, is what leads to better results in both games and real wars.

## Ripple, a puzzle game about 2nd and 3rd order effects

- 原文链接: [Ripple, a puzzle game about 2nd and 3rd order effects](https://ripplegame.app/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46490323)

Ripple is a new online puzzle game where you guess the effects of real historical events. The game shows you one event and asks you to pick what happened next, repeating this for three steps in a chain.

You start by reading a true event from history. Next, you see four possible outcomes and must pick the correct one, thinking about cause and effect. If you pick right, you move to the next link in the chain. Each correct answer leads you deeper into the sequence of historical consequences. If you are wrong, the game explains why your choice was not correct, helping you learn. After finishing three steps, you see your score and can share it with friends. There’s a new puzzle every day, so you can come back to play more, learning about history as you go.

The game is simple to play, but it also makes you think hard about how one event can lead to another. It teaches you to look for second and third order effects, which are not always obvious. For example, a small decision in history might lead to big changes later on. The game helps connect these dots, making learning about history fun and interactive. The design is friendly and clear, so even people who do not know much about history can join in.

Many Hacker News users liked the idea of the game. Some said it is a good way to learn about cause and effect, not just in history, but in real life too. A few people shared that they struggled with remembering details from history, but the game helped them see things more clearly. Others talked about how guessing the second or third effect is tricky, because sometimes the results of an event are not what you expect. Some users wished there were more explanations for each answer, so they could learn even more. A few suggested that the game could add different topics, like science or technology, not just history. One commenter worried that some historical chains might be too simple or too complex, making it hard for everyone. Others said the daily puzzle format is great, because it keeps them coming back. Some people enjoyed sharing their results and discussing the puzzles with friends. Overall, most comments were positive, saying that Ripple is both fun and educational.
