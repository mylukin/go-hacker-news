## Open Source Coalition Announces 'Model-Signing' to Strengthen ML Supply Chain

- 原文链接: [Open Source Coalition Announces 'Model-Signing' to Strengthen ML Supply Chain](https://pypi.org/project/model-signing/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43596543)

The article discusses a new initiative called "model-signing" by the Open Source Coalition aimed at enhancing the security of the machine learning (ML) supply chain. The project helps verify the integrity and origin of ML models, ensuring they haven't been tampered with post-training. It builds on existing security efforts to make ML models as secure as traditional software.

The core idea is to use digital signatures to protect ML models. This involves generating a "sigstore bundle," which includes verification details that are stored in a JSON format. The process uses tools like Sigstore, allowing models to be signed without handling complex cryptographic keys. This method supports both traditional signing and more modern approaches, with options to sign models using public keys or certificates. The verification process involves checking the signature's validity and comparing the model's current file hashes with the signed ones to ensure no changes have occurred.

The article also highlights a command-line interface (CLI) and an API for signing and verifying models. The CLI offers commands to sign models using different methods and verify them afterward. The API provides similar functions, offering flexibility in how models can be signed and verified, with integration options for various ML frameworks and platforms.

In the comments, opinions vary. One user questions the need for such a system, suggesting that sharing a model's hash might suffice. Another commenter points out that the system already includes hashing as part of the verification process, especially since models often consist of multiple files. Another perspective mentions that while the system verifies model signatures, it doesn't verify the decisions made by the models, suggesting a different tool for that purpose. Some commenters express skepticism about the system's adoption, questioning if users will find it useful or if it will be integrated into existing software. Overall, there's curiosity but also a bit of doubt about the practicality and necessity of the initiative.

- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43575515)

A blogger shared their first experience trying to reverse engineer the firmware of a VTech/LeapFrog LeapStart/Magibook, a children's reading device. They began this project because a family member wanted to add more book data to the device, and it also served as practice for their reverse engineering skills.

The LeapFrog LeapStart, known as the VTech MagiBook in France, helps kids learn by reading books placed on the device. It recognizes patterns of dots printed on the pages to play sounds or read text. The blogger found the device's firmware on their computer after a software update. They used a tool called binwalk to explore files in a cache folder, discovering potential firmware files like 'System' and 'FileSys'. The 'FileSys' file appeared as a FAT32 filesystem image, but it contained only small files with no interesting data. The 'System' file seemed like an ARM binary with many ARM function prologues but lacked headers to confirm its exact nature. The blogger also identified some strings suggesting the use of the uC/OS-II kernel in the device.

In the comments, the author was open to feedback, noting it was their first real reverse engineering project. One commenter offered a tip for recognizing ARM binaries by their opcode patterns. Another suggested using a tool from Airbus to help identify the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). These discussions highlight the community's collaborative spirit, offering guidance and resources to help the blogger in their reverse engineering journey.

- 原文链接: [Diagnosing bugs preventing sleep on Windows](https://peteronprogramming.wordpress.com/2025/04/02/diagnosing-bugs-preventing-sleep-on-windows/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43555365)

The article talks about diagnosing why some Windows programs prevent the computer from sleeping, which can affect battery life. The author was asked to find out why a program stopped a computer from auto-locking, which also might stop it from sleeping. They used breakpoints on certain Windows functions and found that a feature in the program was requesting the display to stay on. Even when closing a dialog from this feature, the problem persisted because the dialog was hidden, not closed. Tools like powercfg, pwrtest, and ETW can help find such issues.

In the comments, users shared their experiences with sleep issues on both Windows and Linux. One user finds troubleshooting sleep problems very frustrating, especially with newer Windows sleep modes. Another user mentions that Linux also has bugs, but it doesn't force updates during sleep. Some find booting up faster than waking from sleep. A user mentioned using powercfg to find out what wakes their Windows PC. Others shared how USB devices and even context menus can prevent sleep. There’s a bit of envy towards Mac users, who say they have fewer sleep issues, though some note Macs also have their own sleep problems.

## Five Nurses who work on the same floor at hospital have brain tumors

- 原文链接: [Five Nurses who work on the same floor at hospital have brain tumors](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/5-nurses-work-floor-massachusetts-hospital-brain-tumors-rcna199798)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43597929)

Five nurses working on the same floor at a Massachusetts hospital have been diagnosed with brain tumors, sparking concern. The hospital conducted an investigation and found no environmental risks, concluding that the tumors were benign and varied in type. They ruled out factors like water supply and radiation as causes.

The article notes that the hospital worked with health officials during their investigation. The Massachusetts Nurses Association is conducting its own study, questioning the hospital's conclusions. The American Cancer Society explains that for cases like these to be a cancer cluster, they must involve the same type of cancer in a concentrated area, with a common cause, and more cases than expected.

In the comments, opinions vary widely. Some argue this might be a case of randomness, as it's possible for multiple people to develop cancer in close proximity by chance. Others suggest that the hospital's confidence in safety might be influenced by legal concerns rather than conclusive evidence. Some commentators are skeptical about the dismissal of an environmental cause, pointing out that certain chemicals in hospital settings could be factors. Others mention that working in a medical environment might lead to higher detection rates due to regular health check-ups. A few discuss the complexities of determining cancer clusters, emphasizing that not finding a common cause doesn't necessarily mean one doesn't exist.

## The order of files in /etc./SSH/sshd_config.d/ matters (and may surprise you)

- 原文链接: [The order of files in /etc./SSH/sshd_config.d/ matters (and may surprise you)](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/OpenSSHConfigOrderMatters)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43573507)

The article talks about how the order of files in the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/` directory affects SSH configurations, which can be surprising. The author shares an experience with an Ubuntu 24.04 server where they tried to disable SSH passwords for the internet but allow them for the local network using configuration files. They expected the last configuration to take precedence but found that OpenSSH uses the "first mention wins" rule. This means the first configuration file read by the system takes effect, not the last. The author had to rename their configuration file to ensure it was read first.

In the comments, egberts1 provides detailed resources on SSH configurations and mentions the importance of understanding multi-file configurations. Wruza prefers to delete the default `sshd_config` and start fresh to avoid issues with pre-existing templates. Therein questions the usefulness of cloud-init, often seen as problematic. Eadmund finds the "first-wins" rule surprising and wonders why this design was chosen. O11c suggests that the rule makes sense given SSH's pattern-matching operations. Ajross explains that this approach simplifies the parsing process by reading from the top and exiting once a match is found. Some commenters, like pdimitar, find such surprises frustrating, suggesting these tools need updates, while others, like casey2, incorrectly claim SSH is obsolete, prompting a counter from 77pt77.

## What's in that bright red fire retardant? No one will say, so we had it tested

- 原文链接: [What's in that bright red fire retardant? No one will say, so we had it tested](https://laist.com/news/climate-environment/how-much-toxic-heavy-metal-is-in-that-bright-red-fire-retardant-we-had-it-tested-to-find-out)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43578348)

The article investigates the contents of a bright red fire retardant used in fighting wildfires in California. When tested, the fire retardant was found to contain toxic heavy metals like lead, arsenic, cadmium, and chromium. These metals can be harmful to both the environment and human health. Despite requests, the producers and governmental agencies responsible for the fire retardant did not provide samples for independent testing, so the article's team collected their own samples from affected areas.

Fire authorities argue that the retardant is essential in controlling wildfires and claim that the levels of heavy metals are below safety limits. However, these metals are not mentioned in the safety data sheets provided by the manufacturers, which raises concerns about transparency. The article also highlights the potential long-term environmental impacts, particularly on aquatic ecosystems, as the chemicals can runoff into waterways.

In the comments, there's a mix of opinions. Some say the use of fire retardants is necessary to control wildfires, while others question the legality and ethics of not disclosing the chemical composition of these substances. One commenter points out that heavy metal levels, although low, could accumulate over time, posing a risk. Another commenter suggests that the variability in lead levels could be due to inconsistencies in the chemical mixture rather than sampling errors. There's also a discussion about whether existing safety limits are adequate, with some arguing that even low levels of certain metals could be harmful over time.
