- 原文链接: [The “S” in MCP Stands for Security](https://elenacross7.medium.com/%EF%B8%8F-the-s-in-mcp-stands-for-security-91407b33ed6b)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43600192)

The article is about the security problems with a system called MCP, which stands for Model Context Protocol. MCP connects AI models with tools and data, but it is not secure.

The main points in the article are about the risks with MCP. It says that MCP lets AI models connect to tools and share data easily. But, it has big security problems. Attackers can use command injection, which means they can make the system run bad commands. There is also tool poisoning, where bad instructions are hidden in tool descriptions. Another problem is that tools can change without notice, becoming harmful later. MCP does not have ways to check if a tool is safe or if it has changed.

In the comments, people discussed the security issues further. Some said MCP needs better security checks, like making sure tools cannot change after they are approved. Others said AI needs to better understand what is a safe instruction and what is not. Some people suggested using systems that are already secure, like using APIs that are protected. There are also worries about AI being tricked into doing bad things, like sharing private information. People agree security is important, but they have different ideas on how to make MCP safer. Some think MCP is not secure enough for use yet, while others believe it can be improved with more security measures.

## The order of files in /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/ matters

- 原文链接: [The order of files in /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/ matters](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/OpenSSHConfigOrderMatters)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43573507)

The article talks about how the order of files in a specific folder, /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/, on a computer is important. This folder is used to set rules for SSH, which is a way to connect to computers securely. The problem is that if you put your settings in a file with a high number, like "60-no-passwords.conf," it might not work because another file with a lower number, like "50-cloud-init.conf," is read first and overrides your settings.

The main points are that SSH reads files in order, and the first setting it reads takes effect. If you want to change settings, you need to make sure your file is read first by using a lower number. The article explains that this can be surprising because people often expect that the last setting takes effect. The writer fixed the issue by renaming the file to "10-no-passwords.conf" so it is read before "50-cloud-init.conf."

In the comments, people discuss why this order matters and how it can be confusing. Some say it's normal for files to be read in order and that using numbers helps manage this. Others find it strange because they expect later settings to override earlier ones. Some users are frustrated because managing many configuration files can be hard, and they prefer simpler setups. A few commenters explain that this order is important for security, ensuring that user settings don't override important system settings. Others share tips on how to check what SSH is doing and how to avoid problems with configuration files.

## Lessons from open source in the Mexican government

- 原文链接: [Lessons from open source in the Mexican government](https://lwn.net/Articles/1013776/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43579104)

The article talks about using open-source software in the Mexican government. Open-source software is free to use, change, and share. Federico González Waite shares his experience with using open-source software in government projects in Mexico. 

The main reason for using open-source software is to save money. Mexico wants to reduce costs because it is a developing country. Another reason is for Mexico to have "IT sovereignty," meaning it controls its technology and is not dependent on foreign companies. González Waite helped train people to use open-source software. They also switched some projects from expensive software to open-source ones, like moving from Oracle to PostgreSQL. Open-source laws now support this in Mexico. However, change is hard because people fear new technology and the costs to train staff can be high.

In the comments, people shared different views. Some agreed with González Waite that big software companies can be like "bullies," trying to keep governments and companies using their products. They shared stories of companies like Microsoft using tactics to keep customers. Others mentioned that change is hard because people do not want to learn new things. Some said that training costs can be high, but others think it is worth it to not be locked into expensive contracts. One person said governments should work together to create open-source solutions. Another said that corruption can happen with any type of software, not just open-source or proprietary. People find the topic important and believe that open-source can help governments save money and be more independent.

- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43597425)

The article talks about a tool called "ADHD body doubling." This tool helps people with ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) stay focused by having another person nearby. This other person, called a "body double," does not need to help with the task. They just need to be present.

The main point is that having someone nearby can help people with ADHD focus and get work done. This person can be a friend, family member, or even a colleague. The body double can be there in person or virtually. The key is that their presence helps motivate the person with ADHD. This strategy can help reduce distractions and increase productivity. The article also suggests that body doubling can help with mood and time management.

People in the comments have different views. Some say that working with others or being in a shared space can help them focus better. Others prefer working alone to stay productive. Some people mention using apps like Focusmate to work with others online. A few find white noise or background sounds helpful for concentration. Others talk about challenges with remote work and open office environments, saying they can be either helpful or distracting. Some think the idea of body doubling is interesting but want more research to back it up. Overall, people have mixed feelings about body doubling, with some finding it helpful and others not seeing the benefit.

## SeedLM: Compressing LLM Weights into Seeds of Pseudo-Random Generators

- 原文链接: [SeedLM: Compressing LLM Weights into Seeds of Pseudo-Random Generators](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/seedlm-compressing)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43599967)

The article talks about SeedLM, a new way to make large language models (LLMs) smaller and faster by using seeds from a pseudo-random generator. This helps reduce the memory needed to run the models without losing accuracy.

SeedLM works by using a special method to compress the model's weights. It finds a seed for each block of weights, which then helps create a random matrix. This matrix is used to rebuild the weight block with fewer data. This new method is faster because it reduces the need for memory access, which is often a slow part of running these models. SeedLM doesn't need extra data to work, unlike other methods. Tests show it works well even with very large models like Llama3 70B, keeping accuracy while using less memory.

In the comments, people have different views. Some say the method is interesting but doesn't improve much over current methods. They think using longer tiles might help but could be hard to do. Others argue it keeps high accuracy and is easier to use with hardware, which is good. Some people explain that the method saves space by using random numbers instead of storing everything. Others say it's like a trick in information theory, using simple patterns to replace complex data. A few think the article title is a bit misleading, as it suggests something more than what the method actually does. Overall, many agree it's a good step for making AI faster on devices like phones.

## Blacksmithing and Lisp

- 原文链接: [Blacksmithing and Lisp](http://funcall.blogspot.com/2025/04/blacksmithing-and-lisp.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43566651)

The article talks about blacksmithing and Lisp, a programming language. It compares how blacksmiths and programmers use their tools to make things fit their needs.

The main points are about how blacksmiths shape metal and how this is similar to customizing Lisp. Blacksmiths can heat and shape metal, and if they make a mistake, they can fix it easily. This is like how Lisp lets programmers change the language to help solve their problems better. The writer finds this method of customizing tools similar to how Lisp works.

In the comments, people share their thoughts on the article. One person says that making tools fit the problem is important in any programming language, not just Lisp. Another talks about "wishful thinking," a way of planning code by imagining the best tool first. Some discuss how Lisp gives programmers a lot of power but can be hard to manage in a team. Others compare blacksmithing and Lisp to how some crafts or languages are more popular because they are easier or faster to use. A few commenters discuss why Lisp did not become as popular as other programming languages, even though it is powerful. They say Lisp was once very popular but lost out due to changes in technology and business needs. Overall, people have different opinions on the usefulness of Lisp and how it relates to blacksmithing.
