## Apple's Darwin OS and XNU Kernel Deep Dive

- 原文链接: [Apple's Darwin OS and XNU Kernel Deep Dive](https://tansanrao.com/blog/2025/04/xnu-kernel-and-darwin-evolution-and-architecture/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43597778)

The article is about Apple's Darwin OS and XNU Kernel. It tries to explain the history and design of these systems but the webpage does not load properly.

The main points might be about how Apple uses the Darwin OS and the XNU Kernel in its computers. These systems are important for running the software on Apple devices. They are based on older systems like Mach and BSD. These systems help manage the computer's memory and tasks. Apple chose to use these systems instead of Linux, which is another popular operating system.

In the comments, people talk about how Apple's choice of systems has worked out. Some people wonder if Apple should have used Linux instead. They say maybe Linux could have been better because it is open-source, which means others can see and change the code. But others explain that when Apple bought NeXT, Linux was not ready for what Apple needed. Also, Apple had people who knew the Mach system well. Some people mention that Apple once tried using Linux with a project called MkLinux. Others discuss how Apple chose not to use ZFS, a type of file system, because of legal and technical problems. There is also talk about how Apple’s system is still different from other systems like Windows, which also has its own way of managing tasks. Some people thank the author for the article and wish there was more easy-to-read information about these technical topics.

## Open Source Coalition Announces 'Model-Signing' to Strengthen ML Supply Chain

- 原文链接: [Open Source Coalition Announces 'Model-Signing' to Strengthen ML Supply Chain](https://pypi.org/project/model-signing/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43596543)

The article talks about a new way to make machine learning (ML) models safer. It is called "model-signing."

The main idea is to check if an ML model is safe and hasn't been changed. This is important because many people use ML models, and we need to know they are secure. The project uses a tool called Sigstore to help with this. Sigstore helps make sure the model's signature is valid. Users can then verify that the model is from a trusted source. The project also offers tools for developers to sign and verify models easily.

People in the comments have different opinions. One person says this only checks if the model is signed, not if the model's outputs are correct. Another person likes the idea and thinks security is important for servers too. Someone else wonders if many people will use this tool, comparing it to using a hash. Another commenter asks if there is a real problem with model security today. These comments show that while some people see the need for model-signing, others are unsure if it will be widely used.

The article is about a person starting a project to understand the firmware of a children's reading device called LeapFrog LeapStart or VTech MagiBook. The author is trying to learn how to reverse engineer, which means figuring out how a device works by looking at its software.

The LeapStart/MagiBook is a device that helps kids read books. It has a pen that you use to touch the pages, and it reads the text or plays sounds. The author wants to know more about the firmware, which is the software inside the device that makes it work. When the author used VTech Software to add new books to the device, it also updated the firmware on their computer. The author found some interesting files related to the firmware and plans to study them further. They want to learn how the device reads the dots on the pages and plays sound, and maybe add custom sounds.

In the comments, one person gives a helpful tip about recognizing ARM binary code, which is a type of computer code. They explain that in ARM code, every fourth byte usually has an 'E', which is an easy way to spot it. Another person suggests a tool to help identify the type of computer instruction set used. Finally, the author of the article thanks readers and asks for feedback since this is their first reverse engineering project and blog post.

- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43597929)

The article talks about five nurses at a Massachusetts hospital who all have brain tumors. These nurses work on the same floor of the hospital. The hospital checked for any dangers in the environment that might cause this but found none.

The hospital says the tumors are not cancerous and of three different types. They worked with health officials to check water, masks, and other things but found nothing dangerous. The hospital assures there is no risk to other staff or patients. The nurses' union still wants to look into this more. They think the hospital did not talk to enough nurses about the problem.

People in the comments have different views. Some think it might just be a coincidence. They say it is not unusual for many people to get sick in one place. Others wonder if working in a hospital helps nurses notice symptoms early. One person questions if the hospital has enough proof to say everything is safe. Another mentions that some cancers can be caused by viruses or bacteria. Some people think the hospital says it is safe because of legal reasons.

The article talks about finding and fixing bugs that stop a Windows computer from going to sleep. It explains how a colleague noticed the auto-lock feature not working on their computer because of a new software update. The writer then finds out that this problem also stops the computer from sleeping, which can drain the battery.

The main points of the article are about using tools to find which program stops the computer from sleeping. The writer used a tool called Spy++ to see if a program window was hidden rather than closed. They also mention using Windows tools like powercfg and pwrtest to see which programs make power requests that stop sleep mode.

In the comments, people share their experiences and thoughts. One person says they switched to a Mac to avoid these problems. Another person talks about how sleep issues are common on both Windows and Linux. Someone else says that troubleshooting these issues is hard and sleep problems are frequent on Windows.

- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43597425)

The article talks about a method called ADHD body doubling. This method helps people with ADHD focus and finish tasks by having someone else nearby.

The main idea is that having another person, called a body double, can help someone with ADHD stay on task. The body double does not need to help with the work; they just need to be present. This presence can help the person with ADHD feel accountable and motivated. The article explains that this method can work both in-person and online. It discusses why body doubling might help, like by adding a supportive presence or creating a calm environment. The article also mentions that while there is no scientific proof that body doubling works, many people with ADHD find it helpful.

In the comments, people shared their experiences with body doubling. Some use online tools like Focusmate to work with strangers, which they find very effective. Others say working near strangers, like in a shared office space, also helps them focus better. Some people agree that being with others helps them stay productive, while others do not like working under pressure or with someone watching. A few comments mention that there is not much scientific research on body doubling, but many people say it works for them. Overall, the comments show a mix of positive experiences and some skepticism about the method.

- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43597981)

The article is about a woman named Lucy Connolly who went to jail for 31 months because of a tweet. The article says her punishment is very unfair.

Lucy wrote a tweet that was mean and hateful. She deleted it after four hours, but someone took a screenshot. She was upset about a terrible event where three little girls were killed. Her tweet made people very angry, and she was arrested. Lucy is a childminder and helps many kids of different races. Many people say she is very kind. But the judge gave her a long sentence, saying her tweet could cause violence.

In the comments, people on Hacker News discuss different ideas. Some say the article does not mention that Lucy had many followers and her tweet was read a lot. Others talk about free speech in the US, saying it is illegal to call for violence, but the rules are different in the UK. One person says that in the US, you can only get in trouble if your words are likely to cause immediate violence. Another person wonders how serious a threat needs to be to count as "imminent" or immediate. The comments show that people have different views on free speech and the law.
