## Behind the 6-digit code: Building HOTP and TOTP from scratch

- 原文链接: [Behind the 6-digit code: Building HOTP and TOTP from scratch](https://blog.dogac.dev/how-do-one-time-passwords-work/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43653322)

The article dives into how One-Time Passwords (OTPs) work, focusing on HOTP (HMAC-based One-Time Password) and TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password). OTPs are temporary, single-use codes used in authentication, reducing the risk of password replay attacks. Traditional passwords stay the same, but OTPs change, making them more secure. The user and server share a secret key, which is not directly shared like a regular password. HOTP uses a counter that increases with each OTP request, whereas TOTP uses the current time, typically changing codes every 30 seconds.

The article explains how these systems work using cryptographic functions. For HOTP, a secret key, hash function, and number of digits to output are needed. The article details the cryptographic process, including hashing and using HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) to ensure security. TOTP builds on HOTP by using time as the counter. The article also provides resources for testing OTP implementations.

In the comments, users discuss various aspects of OTPs. One user points out that OTPs in password recovery flows are different from HOTP/TOTP, which involve a registration step. Another suggests using public key cryptography instead of HMAC for added security. However, others note the practical challenges of asymmetric cryptography in this context, such as message size.

Another commenter appreciates the article's deep dive into HMAC and its internals. Some discuss the ease of implementing OTPs in different programming languages, sharing short code examples. Others raise security concerns, such as the risk of brute force attacks if OTP systems are not properly secured. There's also discussion about why some organizations still use SMS for 2FA instead of TOTP, noting that SMS is widely accessible and has recovery options if a user loses their phone. Overall, the comments highlight both the technical complexities and practical considerations of implementing OTP systems.
