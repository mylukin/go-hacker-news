## Claude Cowork Exfiltrates Files

- 原文链接: [Claude Cowork Exfiltrates Files](https://www.promptarmor.com/resources/claude-cowork-exfiltrates-files)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46622328)

Claude Cowork is a new AI tool from Anthropic meant to help with daily work, but it has a big security problem: attackers can steal user files by tricking Claude into sending them to the attacker’s account. The main issue is a vulnerability in Claude’s coding environment that lets prompt injections happen—this means someone can hide secret instructions inside files, and Claude will follow them.

The article explains step-by-step how this attack works. First, a user connects Claude Cowork to a folder with important or private files—like real estate documents. Next, the user uploads a file to Claude that looks normal but actually hides a prompt injection. Attackers make this hidden prompt very hard to see, using things like tiny fonts or white text in a Word file disguised as a Markdown skill. When the user asks Claude to analyze their files with this skill, Claude reads the hidden instructions. These instructions force Claude to run a command that uploads the biggest file it finds to the attacker's Anthropic account, using a secret API key hidden in the prompt. The whole process happens automatically, with no warning to the user.

This works because Claude’s coding environment blocks most outside network connections, but still trusts the Anthropic API—so the attack flies under the radar. Once the file is sent, the attacker’s account has the victim’s sensitive data, which could include things like financial numbers and parts of Social Security Numbers.

The article also notes that even newer versions of Claude (like Opus 4.5) can be tricked by more complex prompt injections, and that Claude can crash or get stuck if it’s forced to read files that are not what they seem (like a fake .pdf). The risk is even bigger because Cowork is meant to interact with lots of different tools and files, making it more likely that it will handle both private and untrusted data without the user checking everything first.

Hacker News commenters have lots of opinions about this. Some are shocked Anthropic hasn’t fixed the problem, especially since it was known before Cowork launched. Others say this is a big risk for regular users, who can’t be expected to spot hidden prompt injections in files they upload. A few think that telling users “be careful with sensitive files” is not enough, and that the real fix should be at the system level, not the user’s responsibility. Some point out that the attack uses trusted APIs, and this kind of vulnerability could show up in other AI tools too. There’s also discussion about how prompt injection is a big, unsolved problem for all AI models with code or file access. A few users wonder if any AI agent should have such broad powers without strong security checks. Others suggest limiting what the AI can do by default, or adding more user warnings and approval steps. Some developers share tips for staying safe, like never uploading files you didn’t create yourself, while others say that’s not practical for most people. Overall, commenters agree that AI tools with broad access need better security and clearer protection for users.

## The Influentists: AI hype without proof

- 原文链接: [The Influentists: AI hype without proof](https://carette.xyz/posts/influentists/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46623195)

This article talks about a popular tweet that claimed AI can build software in just one hour, something that used to take a team weeks or months. The tweet made many people excited and worried, but later, the person who posted it explained that it was not as amazing as it first sounded.

The truth was that the AI did not do all the work by itself. The expert, Rakyll, had already done much of the thinking and planning before using AI. The AI just helped build a basic example, not a real product ready for the world. Also, Rakyll’s deep knowledge made the process possible; a beginner could not do the same. Many viral AI stories leave out details like this to make AI look smarter than it is.

The article says this kind of hype is common now. Some people, called “Influentists,” have big followings and make big claims about AI without much proof. They use personal stories as facts, do not share their code or process, and keep their words vague so they can change their story later.

The writer gives more examples from companies like Microsoft and OpenAI. Leaders there have made bold promises about AI, like rewriting all their code in a new language or saying they have made human-level AI. Later, they often explain that things are not as advanced as they first said.

This hype can hurt the tech community. Young developers may feel bad when they cannot do the “magic” things they see online, not knowing these stories are missing key details. The article warns against trusting people just because they sound confident or get lots of attention.

From the comment section, many readers agree that AI hype is a problem and wish for more honest sharing of results. Some remind others that every new tech goes through a hype phase before people become more realistic. Others say that even if the proof-of-concept is not perfect, it still shows real progress. A few defend the “Influentists,” saying excitement can help bring new people and ideas to the field. Some worry that too much hype could lead to disappointment or even harm the industry’s reputation. Others point out that experts should be more careful with their words, but also that it is hard to judge new tech at first. Many agree that sharing code and clear examples is the best way to prove a claim. Some worry about junior developers feeling lost, while others think this is just part of learning in tech. There is a shared call for more transparency and less drama in tech news.

## Show HN: WebTiles – create a tiny 250x250 website with neighbors around you

- 原文链接: [Show HN: WebTiles – create a tiny 250x250 website with neighbors around you](https://webtiles.kicya.net/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46561341)

WebTiles is a new web project where you can make a very small, 250x250 pixel website, and your site will appear next to others like tiles on a map. The idea is that each little website sits beside others, so you can see your “neighbors” and move around to visit different tiles.

You can log in or register to create your own tile, and you need to complete a captcha for security. Each tile is its own mini-site, and you can manage files for your tile, chat, and even “jump” to other tiles nearby. There’s a simple user interface to move around, and you can see how many people are online. The system also shows your user ID and IP address. It looks like the site is still new, as there are not many people online yet, and some features might be slow or not finished.

In the Hacker News comments, some people really like the idea. They say it reminds them of the old internet, like Geocities or Neopets, where everyone had a small page and could visit others. Others think it’s a fun way to be creative and make something tiny but unique. A few users ask how spam and abuse will be stopped, since anyone can make a tile. Some wonder if it will get much traffic, or if most tiles will stay empty. One person points out that the captcha helps keep bots away. Another notes the site could slow down if too many people join, but others say the tiny size of each site should help with speed. A few users want more features, like better ways to talk to your tile neighbors. Some are curious if people will make art, tiny games, or just simple pages. A few worry about privacy, since user IDs and IPs are shown. Others say this kind of playful web project is what the internet needs more of.

In the comment section, many users say the app is a great learning tool for students and anyone curious about how the Sun’s position changes. Some people like the clear 3D visualizations and say it helps them really understand why we have seasons, long days in summer, and short days in winter. A few users compare this app to other solar calculators and say this one is more interactive and fun. Others talk about using similar apps for planning solar panels or photography. Some mention small bugs or wish for more features, like saving custom locations or exporting images. One person points out that seeing the difference between local noon and solar noon made things clearer for them. Another user likes that you can see how twilight times change with latitude. There is a short discussion about the math behind solar angles and how hard it can be to get it all right. A few people wish the app could work offline or be packaged as a standalone tool. Overall, most users find it useful, well-made, and fun to explore.

## Why some clothes shrink in the wash and how to unshrink them

- 原文链接: [Why some clothes shrink in the wash and how to unshrink them](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/news/2025/08/why-some-clothes-shrink-in-the-wash-and-how-to-unshrink-them/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46572307)

This article is about why some clothes shrink when you wash them and what you can do to fix it. It explains the science behind shrinking and offers a simple way to try to “unshrink” your clothes.

Clothes are made from different types of fibres, like cotton, linen, wool, or synthetic materials. Plant fibres such as cotton and linen have long chains inside them, and these chains are stretched and held tight when the fabric is made. When you wash these clothes, heat, water, and movement can make the fibres relax and try to go back to their natural, crinkled shape. This is why your shirt or dress might get smaller. Hot water makes shrinking worse, but even cold water can cause it, just more slowly. Fabrics that are loosely made, like knits, shrink more easily because their threads can move around. Tightly woven fabrics are less likely to shrink.

Wool shrinks in a different way. Wool has tiny scales on its surface. When washed, these scales open up and grab onto each other, making the fabric dense and smaller. Synthetic fibres, like polyester and nylon, do not shrink much. They are made to be strong and stable, so their fibres do not change shape easily. Some clothes mix natural and synthetic fibres to help stop shrinking. Scientists are also working on new materials that can remember their shape, so shrinking will not be a problem in the future.

If your clothes do shrink, you can try to fix them. Soak the item in warm water with some hair conditioner or baby shampoo. This makes the fibres soft and slippery. Then, gently stretch the fabric back to its old size. Lay it flat to dry, or pin it so it stays stretched. This may not work perfectly for very shrunken clothes, but it can help a little.

In the comments, many people share their own stories of shrinking clothes. Some say they always wash with cold water and gentle cycles, and they have fewer problems. Others think that dryers are the main reason for shrinking, not the washing machine. There are people who tried the hair conditioner trick and say it helped, but only a little. Some commenters say that expensive wool clothes still shrink, even if you wash them by hand. Others wonder why care labels are often confusing or wrong. A few people talk about buying only synthetic clothes to avoid shrinking. Some users like natural fibres better, even if they need more care. One person points out that old clothes shrink less, maybe because they have already been washed many times. Another says the best way is to avoid the dryer and always air-dry clothes. Overall, people agree that shrinking is a common problem, but there are ways to make it less likely.

## So, you've hit an age gate. what now?

- 原文链接: [So, you've hit an age gate. what now?](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/01/so-youve-hit-age-gate-what-now)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46619030)

The article talks about what to do when you reach an “age gate” online—the screen that asks you to prove how old you are before you can use a website or app. It explains why age gates are becoming common and how they can affect your privacy and your rights.

The main point is that age verification is now required on many sites, and while it’s supposed to protect kids, it often means giving up a lot of personal data. The EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation) is against these rules because they risk your privacy and free speech. The article lists different ways sites check your age: some guess your age from what you post, some ask for a selfie (face scan), some want your government ID, and others use things like a credit card or your email address. Each method comes with problems. For example, face scans may not work well for people with darker skin or people who look different from what the software expects. Uploading your ID or credit card means risking leaks if the company is hacked. Even if the company says it deletes your data, mistakes happen, and sometimes data is kept for too long.

The guide suggests always giving as little information as possible, and it gives questions to ask before you share your data: What do they need? Who can see it? How long do they keep it? Has anyone checked if their system is safe? Who knows you’re trying to prove your age?

The article reviews how Meta (Facebook, Instagram, etc.), Google, and TikTok handle age gates. Meta tries to guess your age first and only asks for a selfie or ID if it can’t. Google also guesses, then may ask for a face scan, credit card, digital ID, or photo ID. TikTok uses your videos and photos to guess your age, and if it thinks you’re too young, it can delete your account unless you prove your age fast. These companies often use third-party services, which is another risk because your data can end up in more places.

For other websites, the same issues apply—give the least data possible, and check how your data will be used and stored. The main message is that all current age checks have problems, and that’s why the EFF is fighting against age-gating laws.

In the Hacker News comments, some people say age gates are pointless because kids can still get around them, and only honest users are blocked. Others worry about privacy, saying these systems collect too much personal information and create big risks if there’s a data breach. Some users point out that face scans and digital IDs can be unfair to people who don’t look average or don’t have the right documents. A few say that these laws are well-meaning but hurt more than help, especially for marginalized groups. Others think companies are mainly trying to avoid legal trouble, not really protect kids. Some suggest that parents, not tech companies, should decide what their kids can see online. There are users who agree with EFF and want age gates banned, while others think there is no perfect solution but that some basic checks may be needed for very risky content. A few also mention technical tricks to bypass age gates, but agree this just makes things harder for normal users without stopping the real problem. Overall, most commenters are worried about privacy, fairness, and the growing amount of personal data being collected.

## Native ZFS VDEV for Object Storage (OpenZFS Summit)

- 原文链接: [Native ZFS VDEV for Object Storage (OpenZFS Summit)](https://www.zettalane.com/blog/openzfs-summit-2025-mayanas-objbacker.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46620673)

This article is about MayaNAS's new way to use ZFS directly with cloud object storage, shown at the OpenZFS Developer Summit 2025. They built a tool called objbacker.io, which lets ZFS talk straight to S3, GCS, and Azure Blob Storage, skipping the slow FUSE layer.

The team wanted to solve the big cost problem of running file servers in the cloud. Usual cloud block storage is expensive—$96,000 per year for 100TB on AWS EBS, and $360,000 for AWS EFS. Their idea is that not all data needs to be fast, so they split storage into two: metadata and small blocks stay on fast NVMe SSDs; big blocks (like large files) go to cheap object storage. ZFS’s special device setup makes this easy.

Old methods use FUSE programs like s3fs, but these are slow because every read and write crosses between kernel and user space many times. Objbacker.io instead uses a new ZFS VDEV type, talking to a user-space daemon through a special device file. This daemon uses cloud SDKs to read and write data directly to object storage.

When storing data, ZFS blocks (set to 1MB) map directly to cloud objects. For example, a 5MB file becomes five 1MB objects, named by offset. This helps with fast, aligned writes and reads.

Their benchmarks show strong results: 3.7 GB/s reading and 2.5 GB/s writing from S3, by striping data across six S3 buckets. Testing used big cloud servers (c5n.9xlarge) and 10 parallel jobs.

They also talked about MayaScale, another product for block storage with very low latency, using NVMe SSDs. It works across AWS, Azure, and GCP, and can handle many input/output operations per second.

Deploying MayaNAS or MayaScale is the same on every cloud, using tools like Terraform and similar configurations for each provider.

In the comments, many people are excited about this direct ZFS-to-object-storage setup, calling it a big step forward. Some users ask how stable and production-ready it is, and if it handles network failures or object store delays well. Others wonder about backup strategies and how easy it is to recover from problems. Some are worried about cloud costs if data is accessed often, since object storage is cheap for storage but can be costly for frequent reads and writes. A few users point out that performance numbers are great, but want to see how it works with real-world mixed workloads, not just big sequential reads and writes. There are questions about compatibility with existing ZFS tools and if special tuning is needed. Finally, several people compare this approach to other cloud storage systems and think native integration is the right direction for future cloud storage.

## Show HN: Webctl – Browser automation for agents based on CLI instead of MCP

- 原文链接: [Show HN: Webctl – Browser automation for agents based on CLI instead of MCP](https://github.com/cosinusalpha/webctl)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46616481)

This article is about a new tool called webctl, which lets you control a web browser from the command line. It’s made for both people and AI agents who want to automate browser actions in a simple way.

Webctl uses commands like “navigate”, “type”, and “snapshot” to move around websites, fill forms, and get web page details. You can use filters to only see important page elements, like buttons or links. The tool lets you use Unix commands (like grep or jq) to search and manage its output. It’s easy to script webctl actions, save them, and run them again later. You can run browser sessions in the background, keep cookies and tabs, and switch between profiles. Actions are based on ARIA roles (like button or textbox), which stay the same even if the web page’s style changes. For every command, you can control how much information you get back, in text or JSON. Webctl is built on Chromium and Playwright, and you can install it using Python. It’s also made to work well with AI agents, with quick setup guides and ready agent prompts. The tool’s design separates the command line tool from the browser process, making it flexible and easy to control.

In the comments, people like that webctl uses the CLI instead of the more common MCP (Message Control Protocol) style. Some say the CLI way gives them more power because they can filter and debug more easily using tools they already know. Others mention that using the CLI makes it easier to connect browser actions to scripts or other programs. A few users are happy about ARIA role selectors, saying this is more stable than using CSS selectors, which can change often. Some worry that managing browser sessions and cookies from the command line could be hard for new users. One person asks about security, wanting to know if running browser automation from the CLI can be risky. Another says this tool could help AI agents understand and use the web better because the output is simple and clear. Some think it’s great for quick testing, while others wonder if it can be used for big, complex projects. One user notes the tool feels “Unix-y,” which makes it easy to combine with other programs, and another is glad to see open-source options like this. There are also requests for more Windows support and questions about stability and long-term maintenance. Overall, most people like the idea and see many ways to use webctl for automation and agent work.
