## Atuin Desktop: Runbooks That Run – Now Open Source

Atuin Desktop is a new tool for developers that turns written guides (runbooks) into things you can actually run, like scripts or commands, right from your computer. The team just made it open source, so anyone can use or change it.

The main problem Atuin Desktop wants to solve is that important commands for fixing things are often lost in chats, old documents, or someone’s memory. Their earlier tool, Atuin CLI, let people search their shell history, but that was not enough. Atuin Desktop goes further: it lets you write docs that stay up-to-date, run scripts, database queries, and check charts—all in one place. You can chain together tasks, use templates to make things flexible, and even pull from your real shell history. It helps teams by letting them share, update, and use these runbooks together, either through Git or in real time. Since the closed beta in April, they improved a lot: now it works offline, supports team workspaces, has Kubernetes and MySQL integration, and fixed many bugs. People use it for automating tasks, managing databases, onboarding new team members, and handling outages.

The team plans to add more, like letting runbooks run in the cloud, better permission controls, and more types of steps you can add. They want it to be a living record of how to keep systems running, not just a pile of old notes.

In the comment section, many users are excited about the idea of making documentation that actually works, not just sits and gets old. Some say it could save hours during outages or when onboarding new team members. Others compare it to tools like Jupyter Notebook, but for operations and DevOps. A few users ask about security—like how it handles secrets and if it’s safe to run scripts from shared docs. Some are happy it’s open source and think it will help the community, while others wonder if it could be too complex for small teams. There are questions about how it works with existing tools, like Git or cloud platforms. Some users say they have similar problems at work and want to try Atuin Desktop with their team. Others point out that keeping docs updated is always hard, and hope this tool can really help. A few mention that making setup easy and safe will be important if the tool is to get popular.

## Boeing has started working on a 737 MAX replacement

Boeing is starting to design a new airplane to replace the 737 MAX, one of the world’s best-selling planes. The company wants a new model because the 737 is getting old, and there is pressure from airlines and competition from Airbus.

The 737 MAX had big problems before, including crashes and grounding, which hurt Boeing’s reputation. Airlines want planes that use less fuel, are safer, and can carry more passengers. Boeing’s new plane will likely use new materials and technology to be lighter and more efficient. The company also wants to make the new plane easier to build, so it costs less and has fewer delays. They are looking at new engine designs, which could save even more fuel. But designing a new airplane takes a lot of time and money—sometimes more than ten years and billions of dollars. Boeing needs to make sure the new plane will be safe and pass all regulations. The company has not shared many details yet, but they are working with airlines to understand what is needed. This new plane could help Boeing compete better with Airbus, which already has popular models like the A320neo. The project is still in the early stages, so the new plane will not fly for many years.

In the comments, some people say Boeing should have started this project earlier, instead of updating the old 737 design. Others think Boeing is finally doing the right thing after past mistakes. A few worry that Boeing’s focus on cutting costs could hurt safety and quality. Some people are excited about new technology and hope this plane will be greener and quieter. Others point out that making new planes is very risky and takes a long time. Some discuss if airlines will switch to Airbus if Boeing’s new plane takes too long. A few comment on Boeing’s leadership and whether they can manage a big project well. Some users mention that pilots and mechanics will need new training for the new plane. Others ask if Boeing will fix their work culture and regain trust. There’s hope that competition will bring better and safer planes for everyone.

## Leaked Apple M5 9 core Geekbench scores

- 原文链接: [Leaked Apple M5 9 core Geekbench scores](https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/14173685)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45427197)

A Geekbench result for a new Apple iPad called “iPad17,3” with an M5 chip and 9 CPU cores leaked online. The device scored 4,133 in single-core and 15,437 in multi-core tests, showing big improvements over older iPads.

The M5 chip has 9 CPU cores—split into 3 high-performance cores and 6 efficiency cores—and runs at 4.42 GHz. The iPad tested has 11.2 GB of memory and uses iOS 26.0. In single-core tests, the iPad scored high in things like web browsing, PDF rendering, and photo editing. Multi-core results were even stronger, with fast speeds in file compression, web browsing, and running code with Clang. For example, it can process nearly 368 web pages per second and compress files at 1.73 GB per second. It performs well in AI-related tasks too, like object detection and background blur.

The device’s memory and cache sizes are also higher than before, which should help with multitasking and heavy apps. Many people think these numbers mean the new iPad is faster than most laptops and could be great for creative work, gaming, and maybe even replacing a laptop for some users.

In the comments, some people were excited about the M5’s performance. They said Apple’s chips keep getting stronger, and these scores beat many Intel and AMD laptop CPUs. Others wondered why Apple gave the M5 9 cores instead of 8 or 10, and guessed it may be about balancing speed and battery life. A few people doubted if these scores are real because the leak came early, but others pointed out the details look right for Apple’s usual upgrades. Some developers said they hope Apple will allow more “pro” software on iPad, since the hardware is now powerful enough. There were also comments about how good the iPad is for photo and video editing, but some users still want better file management and software freedom. A few people joked about how fast phones and tablets are now—almost too fast for most tasks. Others discussed how Apple’s chips are leading the industry and pushing competitors to catch up. Overall, most commenters were impressed by the leaked scores and curious what Apple will do next.
