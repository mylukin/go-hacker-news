This article talks about strange internet routing events (BGP anomalies) that happened during a big power blackout in Venezuela. It looks at technical evidence that shows network traffic was behaving in an unusual way at the same time as important political and military events.

The article explains that BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is how routers decide the paths for internet traffic. BGP is known to be insecure and can be viewed in public data. Venezuela's main telecom, CANTV, had traffic paths that were not normal. Some IP address blocks went through CANTV, an Italian provider (Sparkle), and a Colombian carrier (GlobeNet). Cloudflare Radar showed a spike in BGP announcements and a drop in announced IP addresses just before the blackout. Sparkle, one of the carriers, does not use the latest BGP security features. With more investigation, the article found eight IP address ranges affected. These belong to Dayco Telecom, a big company in Caracas, and are used by banks, email, and internet services.

The BGP data showed the CANTV number repeated many times in the path, which is strange. BGP usually prefers shorter paths, so this would make the route less desirable. The timing is interesting: the route leak happened hours before explosions and a military event. The article asks if this could help someone gather intelligence by redirecting internet traffic. The author says there are still many questions, but it's clear something odd happened with BGP during the blackout.

In the Hacker News comments, some readers pointed out that BGP anomalies are not rare and can happen by accident. Others argued that the timing and the repetition of the AS number suggest it was not a simple mistake. Some people worried about how easy it is to mess with BGP, and how this could be used for spying or attacks. A few users discussed how big network operators sometimes make mistakes with BGP, but agreed that the context here made it suspicious. There was also a debate about whether these BGP changes really helped with intelligence gathering, or if it was just a side effect of the blackout or military action. Some commenters wanted more data or official reports before making strong claims. Others shared links to tools and guides for watching BGP traffic, and one person gave tips on how to check if your own network is safe from BGP problems. Overall, readers were split: some thought it was planned, others thought it could be a coincidence, but most agreed that BGP remains a risky part of the internet.

## Try to take my position: The best promotion advice I ever got

- 原文链接: [Try to take my position: The best promotion advice I ever got](https://andrew.grahamyooll.com/blog/Try-to-Take-My-Position/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46466027)

The article is about the best advice the author got for getting a job promotion: act like you already have the next job you want. The advice came from the author's CTO, who told him, "Try to take my position"—not as a threat, but as a way to show readiness for more responsibility.

The author explains that this means doing more than your current tasks. You need to notice bigger problems, make plans to solve them, and show you can help the whole team, not just yourself. For example, a junior engineer once came to the author with a plan to fix a problem in the team. This engineer did not wait to be told what to do. They wrote a plan, guessed how long it would take, and offered a solution. This was a clear sign that the engineer was ready for more responsibility.

The author also says that you must show this kind of behavior for a long time, not just once. Managers watch for people who work at a higher level for at least six months. One good project is not enough—you need to show you can do it again and again. This is because managers want to know they can trust you with bigger jobs, even when things get hard or when no one is watching.

Most people wait for a promotion before they act like a leader. But the article says you need to act first—the title comes after you prove you can do the job. If you want to be promoted, start to act like you already have that job. Think about team problems, bring new ideas, and show that you care about more than your own work.

In the comments, many people agree with the advice. They say it worked for them, too. Some share stories about how they got promoted by taking on extra work. Others say this is common advice in big companies, and managers look for it when deciding who to promote. A few people warn that in some workplaces, extra effort is not always noticed or rewarded. They say you need to make sure your manager knows what you're doing and that you might not always get a promotion, even if you act like a leader.

Some commenters add that you should be careful not to take on too much, or you might burn out. Others remind readers that not every manager is fair—sometimes, managers might take credit for your work. Some people point out that in some companies, there are not enough positions for everyone who acts like a leader, so promotions are rare. But most people agree that showing you can handle more responsibility is the best way to move up.

## Show HN: Tailsnitch – A security auditor for Tailscale

- 原文链接: [Show HN: Tailsnitch – A security auditor for Tailscale](https://github.com/Adversis/tailsnitch)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46501137)

Tailsnitch is a tool that checks your Tailscale network for security problems and bad settings. It helps you find things like too much access, weak keys, and other risks in your Tailscale setup.

The tool can scan your network using over 50 checks, looking for issues in areas like access control, authentication, device security, network exposure, SSH, and logging. For example, it warns if all devices can talk to each other without limits, or if you use keys that do not expire. Tailsnitch can show you problems by severity—critical, high, medium, low, or just info. You can run a basic scan, filter results, and even try to fix some issues directly from the tool. For fixing, you can use an interactive mode, preview what will be changed, or auto-fix safe problems. Tailsnitch also supports exporting reports in JSON or CSV, which is useful for audits like SOC 2.

You set up Tailsnitch by downloading a binary, installing with Go, or building from source. It works with both OAuth and API keys for authentication, but OAuth is better for teams. The tool has many command-line options, so you can choose exactly what to check or ignore. If you have some risks you accept, you can list them in an ignore file. The tool is also good for CI/CD pipelines, because it can fail your build if it finds critical issues. There is clear documentation and example outputs, so you know what to expect from a scan.

In the comments, some people are excited because Tailscale is popular but easy to misconfigure. They like that Tailsnitch helps catch problems before attackers find them. A few users wish Tailscale itself would add more built-in checks or warnings. Some mention that tools like this are important as networks get bigger and more complex, especially for companies that need to show they follow security rules. Others point out that “auto-fix” should be used with care, since changes might break things if you don’t review first. There are questions about how well Tailsnitch works with big networks or multiple admins, and some share ideas for more features, like alerts or regular scans. A couple of people note that open-source tools like this help everyone, since they can be checked, improved, and trusted. One commenter warns that no tool can replace a real security review, but Tailsnitch makes it much easier to spot common mistakes. Overall, most agree it is a helpful addition for anyone using Tailscale.

## Pipe Dreams – The life and times of Yahoo Pipes (2023)

- 原文链接: [Pipe Dreams – The life and times of Yahoo Pipes (2023)](https://retool.com/pipes)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46503006)

Yahoo Pipes was an online tool from Yahoo that let people connect, filter, and combine data from many websites without needing to write code. The article tells the story of how Yahoo Pipes was created, why it was special, and why it stopped.

Yahoo Pipes started in 2006 when Pasha Sadri had the idea for a visual programming tool anyone could use. A small team at Yahoo built it, using drag-and-drop tools to let users make their own data feeds from news, blogs, and websites. You could mix different sources, filter them, and send results to your email, phone, or even a map. Every user’s “Pipe” could be shared or copied by others, which made it easy for beginners to learn and build on each other’s work.

The tool was inspired by Unix pipelines and Apple’s Automator app, but it lived on the web. It worked with feeds like RSS, JSON, and CSV, letting people collect and shape data in new ways. The launch was a surprise success—hundreds of thousands joined, which crashed the servers. The team rushed to make it stable, but Pipes always needed a lot of resources to keep up with demand.

Yahoo Pipes was important because it made programming-like tasks possible for people who didn’t know how to code. It used a simple, colorful interface with drag-and-drop blocks. Users could build complex data workflows, like finding apartments near parks or combining news about a certain topic. The team had fun working together, sometimes taking breaks to play Mario Kart, which even influenced the colors of the site.

But Pipes had problems. It didn’t have a clear way to make money, and Yahoo didn’t commit to supporting it long-term. The code behind it, written in Perl, was hard to scale. Yahoo was also having trouble as a company, with layoffs and changing leaders. Over time, the team left, and Pipes was finally shut down in 2015.

Pipes inspired later tools, like Apple’s Shortcuts, Node-RED, and Huginn. Many visual programming tools today owe something to Pipes. Teachers even used it to help non-programmers learn about data and APIs. But copyright issues and the shift to paid APIs made it harder to do what Pipes did for free. Still, people remember it fondly, and some wish for a new version.

In the Hacker News comments, many users shared fond memories of Yahoo Pipes. Some said it helped them learn about programming or data flows. People liked how easy it was to use, even for non-coders. Others mentioned that Pipes inspired them to build their own projects, like Huginn or Node-RED. Some commenters pointed out the technical challenges, like scaling the service or dealing with websites blocking scraping. A few people discussed the legal gray area of remixing and scraping data from different sites. There were also thoughts about why visual programming has not become as mainstream as expected, and how copyright laws create risks for new projects. Some users said today’s internet, with more closed APIs and less open data, would make a tool like Pipes harder to build. But overall, the comments showed a lot of nostalgia and respect for what Yahoo Pipes made possible.

## It's hard to justify Tahoe icons

- 原文链接: [It's hard to justify Tahoe icons](https://tonsky.me/blog/tahoe-icons/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46497712)

This article talks about the new icons added to every menu item in macOS Tahoe, and why the author thinks this is a bad idea. The main complaint is that these icons make menus more cluttered, confusing, and harder to use, rather than making things easier or quicker to find.

The author explains that icons are supposed to help users find things faster by standing out, but if every item has an icon, nothing stands out anymore. Black-and-white icons look clean, but don’t help with speed either. The article shows examples from Microsoft, where colorful and unique icons work much better. The author also points out that for icons to be helpful, they need to be consistent—both between different apps and within the same app. In Tahoe, the same basic actions like “New,” “Open,” “Save,” and “Close” all get different icons in different places, and sometimes even the same icon is used for totally different actions.

Another problem is that these icons are very small and detailed, making them hard to see or understand, especially on high-resolution screens. Apple uses vector icons, which often look blurry because they aren’t lined up with actual screen pixels. Sometimes, icons rely on small differences—like a slightly thicker line or a tiny letter—which are impossible to notice at that size. The author says that if you can’t find a good metaphor for an action, it’s better to have no icon than a confusing or meaningless one.

The article also criticizes the use of text in icons, saying it’s unclear if it’s supposed to be read or just seen as a symbol. There are issues with icons that use system elements like arrows, dots, or window controls in confusing ways. The author notes that old Apple design rules (the Human Interface Guidelines from 1992) are still useful, because people haven’t changed, even if computers have.

In the end, the author thinks Apple tried to do something impossible by adding icons everywhere and failed to do it well. The result is menus that are harder to scan and understand, with many confusing or repeated icons and lots of inconsistency.

In the comment section, many people agree that the new icons make menus harder to use and look more cluttered. Some users say they find it slower to scan menus now, and they miss the old, simpler look. Others point out that not all icons are bad—if used carefully and kept consistent, icons can help, especially for non-English speakers or beginners. A few commenters defend Apple, saying that new users might benefit from visual cues, and that Apple is probably trying to make things more friendly for everyone, not just power users.

Some people share their frustration with icons that look too similar or are reused for different things. Others mention that this problem isn’t just with Apple—many software companies struggle to make good icons. A couple of designers in the comments say that making a clear icon for every action is almost impossible, and it’s better to use icons only where it really helps. There are also suggestions to let users turn off icons if they don’t like them.

One popular comment jokes about the tiny details in the icons, saying “my eyes aren’t getting any younger.” Another user notes that this is a sign of design trends cycling back and forth between simple and complex. Some commenters hope Apple will listen to feedback and improve things in the future. Overall, most people in the comments agree that the new icons are more annoying than helpful.

## So, you want to chunk really fast?

- 原文链接: [So, you want to chunk really fast?](https://minha.sh/posts/so,-you-want-to-chunk-really-fast)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46501665)

This article is about making text chunking very fast, especially for use in large language model (LLM) pipelines. The author explains how to split big texts into smaller, meaningful parts for better processing and search.

The simple way to chunk text is to just split every N characters, but that often cuts sentences in the middle and gives poor results. A better way is to split at natural breaks, like periods, question marks, or newlines. This helps keep chunks as complete sentences, making search and retrieval better.

There are many ways to do this, but the fastest methods avoid using complex NLP or external models. Instead, they look for delimiter bytes in the text. The author describes using the Rust memchr library, which is very fast at finding single bytes in a string using tricks like SWAR (SIMD Within A Register) and SIMD instructions (AVX2/SSE2). These methods check many bytes at once, instead of one by one.

However, memchr is only optimized for up to three different delimiters. If you need to split on more, like five different punctuation marks, it uses a lookup table with 256 entries, one for each possible byte value. This is still very fast and simple—just check if the current byte is a delimiter in one step.

Another speed trick is to search backwards from the chunk size, not forwards from the start. This way, you find the last possible delimiter before your chunk limit in one pass, instead of having to remember the last one you saw as you move forward.

The author benchmarks their memchunk library and shows it is much faster than other chunking libraries, reaching speeds of up to 164 GB/s. The library also has Python and JavaScript bindings, making it easy to use in different environments.

In the comments, some readers praise the deep dive into low-level optimizations and are impressed by the speed gains. Others share stories of hitting similar limits and using lookup tables themselves. Some question if the differences matter in real-world cases, since disk or network speeds are often much slower than the chunker. A few people discuss whether more advanced sentence splitting (using real NLP) is ever needed, or if delimiter-based chunking is usually good enough. There is also a discussion about how the three-delimiter limit in memchr was a deliberate trade-off and not a technical barrier. Some users ask about edge cases, like chunking with different languages or unusual punctuation. A few comment on the usefulness of the Python and JavaScript bindings for easy adoption. There are also tips for integrating memchunk into existing pipelines and questions about memory use. Overall, readers like the practical and performance-focused approach, though some wonder how often this level of speed is needed in daily work.

## Gatekeepers of Law: Inside the Westlaw and LexisNexis Duopoly

- 原文链接: [Gatekeepers of Law: Inside the Westlaw and LexisNexis Duopoly](https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/gatekeepers-of-law-inside-the-westlaw)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46502736)

This article looks at how two companies, Westlaw and LexisNexis, control access to legal information in America. The author explains how these companies became so powerful and why this is a problem for both lawyers and the public.

A long time ago, legal research meant reading many books in a law library. West Publishing made this easier by collecting and organizing court decisions into books. They also made tools to help lawyers find laws and cases. Over time, West grew bigger by buying other companies. Other companies, like Shephard’s and Lexis, also offered legal research tools. In the 1970s, Lexis and Westlaw started putting legal information on computers, which changed how lawyers did research.

West had a special system with page numbers and summaries, which made it hard for new companies to compete. For many years, West’s system was protected by copyright. But in the 1990s, a big court case ruled that page numbers in court decisions could not be copyrighted. This meant other companies could use the same page numbers, making it easier for them to compete.

Still, West and Lexis became even stronger by buying smaller companies. Soon, only these two companies were left in the market. The government allowed this to happen, even though many people warned it would make legal research much more expensive. Now, both companies charge very high prices for their services. For example, searching for a single legal case on Lexis can cost almost $500. Small law firms pay thousands of dollars every month just to look up public records.

The article also talks about PACER, the government system for court documents. PACER also charges high fees and has an old, hard-to-use website. This makes it tough for regular people to read court records, even though the law is supposed to be public.

The author argues that because the government creates these legal documents, it could let everyone use them for free. If legal information was open and easy to find, new companies could offer better, cheaper services. This would help small law firms, public defenders, and people who need legal help but cannot afford high prices.

In the comments, many people agree that the high costs for legal research are unfair. Some say this keeps justice out of reach for poor people and makes the legal system less open. Others remember using old books in libraries and think the move to digital should have made things cheaper, not more expensive. A few people say that the government should run a free, public legal search service. Some point out that in other countries, legal documents are easier and cheaper to access.

Some commenters are worried about quality. They say that Westlaw and LexisNexis offer extra tools and summaries that free services might not provide. A few note that even if the law was open, it would still be hard for regular people to understand legal writing. Others talk about the power of lobbying and how big companies work to stop new competitors. There are also comments about PACER’s old design and security problems. Some hope that new technology, like AI, could help, but only if it can access the full set of legal data. Overall, most agree that making the law more open would help everyone, but they are not sure if the government or companies will make it happen soon.

## A Year of Clean Energy Milestones

- 原文链接: [A Year of Clean Energy Milestones](https://e360.yale.edu/digest/2025-energy-review)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46504198)

This article talks about the big changes in clean energy around the world in 2025. It explains how wind, solar, and electric cars have reached new records, even as some countries, like the U.S., have cut support for renewables.

For the first time, wind and solar made more electricity than coal worldwide. Electric cars were over one-fourth of new car sales, and in China, they were more than half. These changes are possible because wind and solar energy have become much cheaper. Batteries for storing energy are now 90% cheaper than ten years ago. This means solar power can be used any time of day, not just when the sun is out.

Last year, all the new electricity demand was met by new wind and solar projects. China, which used to be the biggest polluter, is now seeing its coal use—and its emissions—go down for the first time in years. The cost of making power from wind and solar is now lower than from coal or gas, even without government help.

Gas-powered car sales probably peaked back in 2017, since electric vehicles are growing fast, especially in places like China. Even though the U.S. has slowed down support for clean energy, the rest of the world is moving ahead, and investment in clean energy is at an all-time high. The International Energy Agency says the U.S. will grow more slowly in renewables than once expected, but global progress is still strong. The growth of clean energy was even named the “Breakthrough of the Year” by the journal Science. The climate outlook has improved too; scientists now think the world will get less hot than they thought before the Paris Agreement in 2015.

In the comment section, some people are excited about these results and say it’s proof that clean energy can work on a large scale. Others point out that while renewables are growing, fossil fuels are still used a lot, and emissions are not dropping fast enough. Some users are worried about the U.S. falling behind and say it could miss out on future jobs and new industries. A few commenters ask if battery storage and electric grids are strong enough for all these renewables. Others think China’s fast move to clean energy is surprising and impressive. Some users are hopeful that as prices fall even more, change will come faster. But there are also worries about the need for more rare metals, the challenge of recycling old batteries and wind turbines, and the need for better ways to handle energy when the wind isn’t blowing or the sun isn’t shining.

Sega’s co-founder, David Rosen, has died. He helped start Sega, a famous video game company known for Sonic the Hedgehog and many arcade games.

The article says Rosen first sold art in Japan after World War II. He then started a company to make photo booths. Later, this company became part of Sega, which began making coin-operated games. Rosen led Sega as CEO for many years, helping it grow. With his leadership, Sega released popular arcade games and home consoles. Games like Space Harrier and Out Run became hits. The company also created the Sega Genesis, a very popular game console in the 1990s. Rosen worked at Sega until he retired, but he stayed active in the game business.

People in the Hacker News comments shared memories of playing Sega games when they were kids. Some said Sega helped make video games popular worldwide. Others talked about how Rosen saw chances to bring new ideas from Japan to the rest of the world. A few users remembered visiting old arcades and playing Sega machines. Some said Sega’s story is important for anyone who likes video games. Others wished more people knew about Rosen and his work. One person said Rosen’s work shows how one person can change an industry. Some people shared links to interviews with him. Others felt sad that not enough people remember the early leaders of gaming. A few discussed how Sega changed after Rosen left. Many thanked him for the joy his games brought into their lives.

## Show HN: DoNotNotify – log and intelligently block notifications on Android

- 原文链接: [Show HN: DoNotNotify – log and intelligently block notifications on Android](https://donotnotify.com/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46499646)

DoNotNotify is a new Android app that lets you control which notifications you get on your phone. It helps you block annoying or useless alerts, so you can focus better and only see what matters.

The app works like a firewall but for notifications. You can set up rules to allow or block notifications based on the app name, what the message says, or even by using regex patterns for more detailed filtering. For example, you can make sure you never miss important messages or alerts, but block all the ads and spam. DoNotNotify promises to keep your privacy safe: everything happens on your device, offline, with no data sent to any server. They say they do not track anything or collect any personal information. The app’s interface is designed to be simple, clean, and easy to use, so anyone can set it up quickly. There’s a privacy policy that explains their rules in detail, and the developer says privacy is a basic right for everyone. You can get the app from Google Play, and there’s a help section if you get stuck.

On Hacker News, many users liked the idea, saying notification spam is a real problem on Android. Some praised the privacy focus, saying offline processing is much better than cloud-based solutions. Others shared that they often miss important messages because of too many useless notifications. A few users wanted to know if the app works with every Android phone, since system limitations can make blocking tricky. Some people worried about whether it needs too many permissions, or if Google might block it in the future. One commenter said it could be helpful for parents to control notifications on kids’ phones. Another user warned that clever spammers may find ways around these blocks. But overall, most people agreed this tool could help them focus and reduce distractions. A few asked for open source code, to trust it even more. There was also discussion about how Android’s notification system can be confusing, and how a tool like this could make things better. Some wondered if Apple users might get a similar app one day.
