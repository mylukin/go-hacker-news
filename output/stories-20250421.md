- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43747921)

The article discusses a project that reverse engineers TikTok's obfuscated virtual machine (VM) used in their web application. The VM is part of TikTok's security measures and is found in a file called `webmssdk.js`. The project provides tools to deobfuscate and decompile the VM's code, making it readable and understandable. It also allows for the injection of the deobfuscated VM back into TikTok, enabling further analysis and exploration of how TikTok's security features work.

The process begins with deobfuscating the heavily encoded JavaScript code in `webmssdk.js`. This involves deciphering complex bracket notations and function calls that obscure the actual code. The project uses various techniques, like converting obfuscated function arrays into readable functions using AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) transformations. Once deobfuscated, the bytecode of the VM, which is initially encrypted, is decrypted using XOR operations. The VM supports sophisticated features such as scopes and exception handling, and the project provides a decompiler to further analyze these features. This decompiled VM can then be used to understand how TikTok generates important request signatures, which are crucial for making authorized server requests.

In the Hacker News comments, there are mixed opinions. Some users highlight the usefulness of AI tools in deobfuscating code, noting that AI can rewrite complex JavaScript into more understandable forms. Others question the effectiveness of AI in handling heavily obfuscated code. There's also a discussion about the purpose of such obfuscation, with some suggesting it's mainly for bot protection, while others suspect it could hide more nefarious activities. Some commenters argue that this level of obfuscation is unnecessary for a social media app, while others note that such measures can increase the cost for bots, making it a useful deterrent. Additionally, there's debate about what constitutes a "virtual machine," with some users pointing out that TikTok's VM is more about obfuscation than traditional VM functionality. Overall, the reverse engineering project is seen as a significant technical achievement, shedding light on how complex obfuscation techniques can be tackled.

- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43747242)

The article from Citizen Lab talks about a campaign called JUICYJAM, used by Thai authorities to suppress pro-democracy movements. Since 2020, this campaign doxxes, or reveals private information about, people online to intimidate them. The report links JUICYJAM to the Thai military and police, who allegedly use fake personas on social media platforms like X and Facebook to target protesters. This campaign is part of a larger effort to stop pro-democracy voices in Thailand.

JUICYJAM involves spreading private data, like family names and business addresses, to harm activists. The campaign uses a fake online persona named "Ms. Juk Khlong Sam", who pretends to be a regular person but is likely a front for state operations. Despite the harmful nature of JUICYJAM, social media platforms have struggled to stop it, showing a gap in how they handle doxxing, especially when backed by states. Leaked documents from Thai officials suggest JUICYJAM is a state-sponsored effort, but social media companies have not done much to counter it.

In the comments on Hacker News, users shared mixed opinions. Some feel that free speech is a universal right, not just a Western one, but others argue that cultural differences make this view too simplistic. Some commentators believe the Thai reverence for monarchy and social harmony complicates adopting Western-style freedoms. Others criticize the role of social media platforms, saying they should do more to protect users from state-backed harassment. The debate also touches on broader issues of free speech, comparing how different countries handle it and questioning what role governments and companies should play in regulating speech online.

## Show HN: Keep your PyTorch model in VRAM by hot swapping code

- 原文链接: [Show HN: Keep your PyTorch model in VRAM by hot swapping code](https://github.com/valine/training-hot-swap/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43747560)

A new GitHub project, "training-hot-swap," allows you to change PyTorch code without removing your model from VRAM. This is useful because loading large models from disk to VRAM can take a long time, slowing down development. The tool keeps models in VRAM by using a second process that runs in the background, which means the model is immediately ready when you rerun your script. It can also work remotely, letting you run training scripts over a VPN.

The project supports a GUI using DearImgui Python bindings, helping you monitor and interact with your models quickly. It’s designed to integrate with IntelliJ for remote development, and you can debug using IntelliJ's server. However, because it executes arbitrary code, it's important not to expose the server directly to the internet due to security risks.

In the Hacker News comments, some users mention using Python notebooks for similar functionality, as they allow you to load models and test scripts easily. Others are interested in the visualizer app, which looks promising for tensor visualization. A user asked about using the tool in a client-server mode, and the creator explained that the rendering is done with OpenGL and can be streamed back using WebRTC. There's some interest in the visualization features, though access to them is limited by a platform requirement. Another user suggests a workaround for accessing these visualizations.

## Reworking 30 lines of Linux code could cut power use by up to 30 percent

- 原文链接: [Reworking 30 lines of Linux code could cut power use by up to 30 percent](https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-center-energy-consumption)

The article talks about a small change in the Linux operating system that could lead to big energy savings in data centers. Researchers found a way to make the Linux kernel more efficient when it comes to handling network traffic. By reworking about 30 lines of code, they managed to cut power use by up to 30% in certain conditions. This change is especially useful for data centers, where network traffic varies a lot. The code change has been included in the Linux kernel version 6.13, and it could have a large impact since Linux is widely used in data centers.

The technique works by adjusting how the system handles network packets. Normally, the system continuously checks for packets, even when there's nothing to process, wasting energy. The new method makes the system smarter, only checking frequently when there’s heavy network traffic. When traffic is light, it goes back to waiting for signals, saving power. This approach makes the system more flexible and efficient without needing new code, just a reordering of existing processes.

In the Hacker News comments, opinions were mixed. Some users noted that the change mainly helps data centers and won't affect all Linux users, such as those on desktops or home routers. Others highlighted that while the title suggests a broad impact, the optimization is very specific, mainly affecting software that uses certain Linux features. Some argued that while energy savings are great, they might not be significant for everyday users. One user pointed out that many data center applications bypass the Linux kernel for performance reasons, so the impact might be limited there. Others appreciated the focus on efficiency, saying it's a return to important values that have been overlooked in the tech industry.

## X-Ray Defence

- 原文链接: [X-Ray Defence](https://lichess.org/@/Mcie/blog/x-ray-defence-hidden-resource-sudden-lifeline/HERaZrZg)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43721853)

The article is about using X-ray tactics in chess as a defensive strategy. It follows up on a previous lesson about offensive X-ray tactics. The X-ray in chess involves a piece influencing a square indirectly through another piece. While the earlier lesson focused on attacking, this one shows how X-rays can help in defense, often overlooked in chess teaching.

The article gives examples where X-ray defense helps save positions that seem lost. For example, a move that defends a square indirectly through another piece turns a dire situation into a winning one. It demonstrates this with several chess puzzles, highlighting that recognizing defensive X-rays can be as rewarding as spotting attacks. The article encourages players to practice these defensive skills to improve their game.

In the comment section, one user notes that defensive tactics are often underrepresented in training, making them harder to spot during games. Another commenter explains that defending in chess, like in many sports, can be more challenging than attacking because one mistake can be costly. Some suggest that the lack of focus on defense might be because strong defensive play can lead to draws, which might not be as exciting. There are also suggestions about using Lichess, a chess platform, for specific training on defensive themes. A commenter points out the importance of X-ray defense lines, which can foresee potential changes in board positions.
