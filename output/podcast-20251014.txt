Hello everyone, this is the 2025-10-14 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have eight stories that cover privacy, AI, science, ancient history, and more. Let’s get started.

Our first story is about a secret investigation into First Wap, a company that sells powerful phone-tracking software called Altamides. Reporters found a huge archive of tracking data—over 1.5 million records—that showed people all over the world were being watched. Not just criminals, but also journalists, business leaders, and even regular people like teachers and therapists. The investigation started when a reporter found this data on the deep web and worked to match phone numbers to real people in more than 160 countries. Some tracked people were famous, like former political leaders and activists.

First Wap claims it only sells to governments to fight crime and terror, but the reporters found evidence that private companies and individuals also got the tools—sometimes to spy on competitors or stalk people. The software was sold in secret and often ended up in the wrong hands. The British KCS Group, for example, tried to sell the system to governments during the Arab Spring and also used it for business investigations.

Altamides works by exploiting a weakness in the global phone network called SS7. This allows almost anyone with access to track a phone, intercept messages, listen to calls, or break into apps like WhatsApp. First Wap kept a low profile for years as its business grew around the world.

To see how careful First Wap is with its clients, reporters pretended to be buyers at a surveillance tech fair. The company’s executive, Günther Rudolph, admitted it is risky to sell to people under sanctions, but suggested using fake companies to hide deals.

When asked about this, First Wap denied breaking any laws and said it always checks its clients. They also said they do not track people themselves, just sell the tools.

Many readers in the comments were shocked at how easy and widespread this kind of surveillance has become. Some pointed out that SS7 problems have been known for years, but little has been done. Others worried that regular people have almost no way to protect themselves. Some said it is not just one company, but a whole industry, and that governments use these tools too. There was a lot of debate about responsibility and whether more laws, or at least public attention, could help stop this kind of misuse. Overall, people agreed this is a serious problem that goes far beyond just one company.

Our next story is about AppLovin, a big mobile ad company, and how it installs apps on Android devices without clear user consent. The researcher, Ben Edelman, looked at AppLovin’s code and user complaints to show this is really happening. He found that after a user clicks an ad—even by mistake—another app can be installed right away. Sometimes there is no warning; sometimes there is a countdown or a very small X button to cancel, which is hard to tap. If users do not hit cancel in time, the app installs by itself.

Edelman found over 200 user complaints, with screenshots and videos that match what the code does. Many people blamed helper apps from Samsung or T-Mobile, but these helpers only followed AppLovin’s instructions. AppLovin’s CEO says every install is a user’s clear choice, but Edelman disagrees, saying a small X or a time limit does not count as real agreement.

He also asks why Samsung and T-Mobile allow this. Maybe they get paid, or maybe they only meant to allow installs during setup but did not stop it later. Edelman uses several types of evidence: code analysis, permissions, public statements, and user complaints—all pointing to the same problem.

In the comments, many people were surprised this is allowed on Android. Some blamed Samsung and T-Mobile for giving AppLovin too much power. Others said Android’s permission system is too weak. A few defended AppLovin, saying users should be more careful, but most people think the X button is too small on purpose. Some asked why Google is not stopping this and worried about privacy and security. There was also debate about legality, and some users shared their own stories of unwanted apps.

Our third story is about testing a cheap $2.97 ADC chip called ADS1115. ADCs are used to measure voltages, and while microcontrollers often have built-in ADCs, they are not very precise—usually only giving about 8 or 9 useful bits. The ADS1115 is a dedicated chip that promises true 16-bit readings and has a special programmable gain amplifier for measuring very small voltages accurately.

The author found that while the cheap versions of the chip worked at first, they had problems. One chip gave the wrong number of samples per second and was noisier than expected. The voltage readings were also off by about 0.5%, much worse than promised. However, a simple software correction made the measurements quite accurate. The writer guesses these cheap chips could be good copies or failed parts that were not supposed to be sold. He plans to compare them with a more expensive Adafruit version.

In the comments, people said cheap electronics from random sellers often have quality issues or are even fake. Some said that for hobby projects, these small errors do not matter, but warned that using them in professional products could be risky. Others were impressed that the cheap ADCs worked as well as they did. Many people reminded everyone to double-check important measurements and to buy from official distributors if you need guaranteed performance.

Our fourth story is about a smart vacuum cleaner that stopped working when the owner blocked it from sending data to its maker’s servers. The owner noticed the vacuum was always talking to servers in another country and wanted more privacy, so they blocked the connections. After that, the vacuum slowly stopped working, even though it should have worked offline. Each time it was fixed by the service center, it only worked until it was back home and blocked again.

The owner opened up the vacuum, found it was running Linux, and explored its hardware. They found a hidden USB port that gave root access with no password, and found scripts that could remotely disable the vacuum. The logs showed a “kill command” was sent at the exact time it stopped working. The company used a tool called “rtty” to control the vacuum from anywhere. This meant the company could punish customers who blocked data sharing by turning off their devices. The same hardware is used in many other brands, so the problem could affect many people. In the end, the owner set up the vacuum to run offline and shared all their findings online.

Many comments were shocked by how much control companies have over smart devices. Some said this is why you should put smart gadgets on a separate network or avoid cloud-connected devices altogether. Others called the company’s actions wrong or even illegal. Some people were impressed by the technical skills needed to reverse-engineer the vacuum, while others worried this practice will continue because most users never notice. There was strong support for privacy, user control, and the right to repair.

Our next story looks at how AI can understand and group different English accents. A team at BoldVoice used a model called HuBERT, trained on speech from people who speak over 200 languages, to map out how accents cluster together. The AI learned by listening to raw audio, and the results were shown in a 3D map where each point is a short piece of speech colored by accent.

To protect privacy, they used a “voice standardization” step, so only the accent is heard, not the person’s real voice. The map showed some surprises—for example, Australian and Vietnamese accents are close, possibly because some Vietnamese speakers in Australia blend both accents. French, Nigerian, and Ghanaian accents also cluster together, maybe due to migration or history. In India, southern and northern accents form different groups, matching geography.

The AI seems to group accents by sound, not just language roots. The project could help build better tools for learning pronunciation.

People in the comments liked the visualization and how it makes accent data easy to explore. Some worried the voice standardization might hide real details, and others asked about privacy. Linguists discussed whether the clusters match real-life similarities or are just artifacts of the model. Many people agreed it could help learners and teachers understand accents better, and some wanted to see the tool expanded.

Our sixth story compares what Americans really die from to what gets reported in big news outlets. Most Americans die from heart disease and cancer—over half of all deaths—but these causes only get 7% of news coverage. Instead, the news talks much more about rare events like homicides and terrorism. Terrorism caused only 16 deaths in 2023, but takes up a big part of the news. Homicides and terrorism get much more coverage than their real share of deaths.

The article says this is because news wants to tell stories that are new, exciting, and shocking. If people mostly see stories about murder and terrorism, they might think these are common problems, even if they are rare. This makes people more afraid of crime or terrorism, even as real rates fall. The authors say we should be aware of this bias and not let news reports shape our beliefs too much.

In the comments, many people agreed that media focuses too much on dramatic stories and ignores common issues. Some said this is because news companies need attention and clicks. A few argued that news should still cover rare events because they are important, while others said more coverage of heart disease might not help. Many said fear sells better than facts, and that it is easy to get a twisted view of the world from the news.

Our seventh story is about a new way to treat cancer using ultrasound. Doctors now use focused sound waves, not just for imaging, but to destroy tumors inside the body. The main method, called histotripsy, uses short, fast pulses to make tiny bubbles inside tumors. These bubbles pop and break the tumor apart, and then the immune system cleans up. This treatment is non-invasive and does not use heat, so patients can often go home the same day. It is now approved for liver cancer in the US and UK, and is being tested for kidney and pancreas cancers.

There are some limits—histotripsy does not work well if bones block the sound, or in lungs. There is also not enough long-term data yet, so doctors are not sure how often cancer comes back after this treatment. Another method, HIFU, uses heat to “cook” tumors and is used for prostate cancer.

Some people in the comments were excited about these new treatments and liked that they are less painful than surgery. Others were cautious, pointing out the lack of long-term data and possible unknown risks. Some worried about cost and access, while others hoped that research will open these options to more patients.

Our last story is from the world of ancient history. A 12,000-year-old stone with a human face was found at Karahan Tepe in Turkey. This is the first time a T-shaped pillar from this area shows a human face carved into it. Earlier stones had arms and hands, and people thought they stood for humans, but now there is a clear face—carved with deep eye sockets and a thick nose.

Experts say this is a big moment in the study of the Neolithic period, showing that people back then had both good skills with stone and ideas about self-expression. The find is part of the Taş Tepeler Project, which studies how people first started to live in one place and how their beliefs changed.

In the comments, many people said this is an amazing find that could change what we know about early humans. Some compared it to other old sites and wondered if even older art is out there. Others discussed how hard it is to date something this old, or whether the carving is really a face. Most agreed it is an exciting discovery and talked about what it means for our ideas about early religion and culture.

That’s all for today’s episode. Thank you for listening to Hacker News Daily Podcast. We’ll be back tomorrow with more news and discussions from the world of technology, science, and beyond.
