Hello everyone, this is the 2025-12-28 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have a full set of stories for software developers and tech fans, from big changes in open source, to new security bugs, to the power of simple tools and the memories of tech leaders. Let’s get started.

First, the maintainer of Mockito, one of the most popular Java testing tools, has decided to step down after ten years. He shared his reasons and the challenges he faced. The main problem came from a change in the Java Virtual Machine, starting with JVM 22. This made the old way of running Mockito unsafe, so the tool had to become a JVM agent. The maintainer said this change was meant to make things safer, but it made life very hard for open source maintainers like him. He felt that the JVM team did not support them enough, and too much of the work was left to Mockito’s volunteers. This made the project tiring and stressful.

Another big challenge was Kotlin. More people use Kotlin now, but it is very different from other JVM languages. Mockito had to add special code just to support Kotlin, and sometimes the same logic had to be written twice. This made the code base messy and harder to manage. The maintainer said he did not enjoy this, and expected it to only get more difficult as Kotlin grows.

He also found more joy working on other open source projects, like Servo, the Rust-based browser engine. In the end, working on Mockito started to feel like a chore. He believes it is time for new people, who care more about Kotlin and have fresh energy, to lead the project. He thanked everyone for the support and still recommends open source work to others.

The Hacker News comments were full of thanks for his work. Some said open source is often a thankless job, and agreed that big changes like the JVM update should come with more help for important projects. Others noted how hard it is to support Kotlin in Java libraries now. Some people shared their own stories about stepping down from open source, and how it helped them enjoy programming again. There were worries about the future of open source tools if the work is too hard or not fun. Many wished him good luck with his next projects.

Our next story is about the value of cynicism for software engineers working in big tech companies. The article says that being a little bit cynical—meaning a little skeptical or careful—can help engineers understand how things really work in large organizations. The writer said some people think his advice is too negative, like saying you should always try to please your manager, or that big tech decides what you work on. Another writer argued that engineers should care more about good work than just following orders. But the author replied that even in big companies, you can do important work if you learn to work with others and understand the system.

He points out that being too idealistic, thinking companies are only after money and don’t care about good code, can also be unhealthy. That view makes you see the world as broken and selfish. Instead, he says, a bit of cynicism is realistic—it helps you work with others, play some politics, and get things done on big teams. He compares it to public service: you may not control everything, but you can still do good.

In the comments, some agreed that a little cynicism helps you avoid disappointment and see problems clearly. Others thought the author sounded too negative, saying it’s better to try to improve things than just accept them. Some shared stories of trying to make changes at work, but running into company politics. Others talked about the need to balance realism and idealism, saying that both are important for a healthy and happy work life.

The next story is about PySDR, a free online book that teaches software-defined radio and digital signal processing using Python. This book is for people who know Python but are new to SDR and DSP. The author, Dr. Marc Lichtman, explains the main ideas using clear pictures and animations, instead of heavy math. The book uses Python code with NumPy and Matplotlib, so you can see and understand signals easily. It covers a full semester’s worth of DSP basics, then moves on to SDR topics. The book is free, open source, and many people help improve it or translate it on GitHub.

Hacker News readers praised PySDR for its clear teaching style and hands-on approach. Some wished they had it in school, since many SDR books are too complex. Others liked that it focuses on doing real work, not just theory, and that Python is a good choice for learning, even if it’s not the fastest for big projects. Some shared their own experiences with SDR hardware, saying PySDR helped them use their tools better. A few wanted even more advanced content, but most agreed it is a great place to start. The community liked how open and friendly the project is.

Our next story takes us back in time, to a secret city in China called “404.” This city was built in 1958 in the Gobi Desert for China’s atomic bomb program. The city did not appear on maps, and life there was very hard at first. There was almost no water, sandstorms were common, and people had to build everything by hand. During the famine years, food was very scarce, but the people survived by starting farms and hunting.

Over time, 404 became more like a small city, with shops, parks, and even a factory for popsicles. The people there felt proud and special, but they also faced dangers from radiation. Factories and homes were kept far apart, and there were strict safety rules. Some workers got sick from accidents, and the idea of “clean nuclear energy” felt strange to those living there. The author remembers a childhood full of normal things—school, playing, and family—but always with reminders of the city’s secret role.

Hacker News users found the story moving and powerful. Many compared 404 to secret cities in the US and Russia, and wondered about the long-term health effects for people who lived near nuclear materials. Some talked about the mental health effects of living in such an isolated, controlled place, and others asked if there are still secret cities today. Many felt the story showed both the pride and the price of building something so important for the country.

Now, let’s talk about a serious security bug in MongoDB, called MongoBleed. This bug affects all versions since 2017, and lets attackers read private information from a database server’s memory, including passwords, API keys, and customer data. The problem is in how MongoDB handles compressed messages with zlib. If an attacker lies about the size of the uncompressed data, the server creates extra space in memory and fills it with old data. Later, the server may send this data back in a response, letting attackers read secrets without even logging in.

This bug was found in December 2025, but the code problem started in 2017. Over 213,000 MongoDB servers are exposed on the internet, so the number of targets is huge. The fix was simple, but it took MongoDB days to patch their cloud service, and they were slow to warn the public. Users are told to update their servers or turn off zlib compression. A proof-of-concept attack is already public.

Hacker News commenters were upset, calling this a basic security mistake. Some blamed developers for exposing databases to the internet without protection. Many were angry that MongoDB did not warn users fast enough. Others compared it to the old Heartbleed bug, and warned about the dangers of so many cloud databases being open to the world. There were tips on how to check if your server is safe, and reminders to always keep software up to date.

Next, we remember Lou Gerstner, IBM’s CEO from 1993 to 2002, who has passed away. Lou led IBM when it was in deep trouble, and many thought the company should split up. He disagreed, and kept IBM together, focusing on what customers really wanted. He ended long, boring meetings and told people to speak honestly and focus on client needs, not just company rules. Lou believed that changing IBM’s culture was as important as changing its business strategy. He helped IBM balance short-term results with long-term innovation, and after leaving, kept giving advice to the company. Before IBM, he worked at McKinsey, American Express, and RJR Nabisco, and later led The Carlyle Group.

On Hacker News, many people thanked Lou for saving IBM, saying he was the right leader at the right time. Some pointed out that not all his changes were popular—some people lost jobs, and old traditions ended. There was talk about whether IBM lost its way after Lou, but most agreed he made a huge impact on IBM and tech history.

Now, to network protocols. The Pion SCTP team added the RACK algorithm, making data transfer much faster and with less delay. SCTP is a protocol used for real-time apps, like video calls and online games. It can handle both big and small messages, and is good at keeping data safe even in bad network conditions. The old ways of handling lost data were slow or caused too many extra resends. The new RACK method watches the time since each packet was seen and uses network stats to guess if something is lost, sending a test packet to help check for missing data.

Tests showed adding RACK made data transfers 71% faster per CPU used, and latency dropped by about 27%. In some cases, speed improved by up to 44%, and jobs finished twice as fast. CPU usage went down, too. The team also found and fixed bugs during testing, making RACK work even better.

Comments showed excitement for the SCTP and RACK improvements, since SCTP is often ignored compared to TCP and UDP. Some discussed real-world use cases, like WebRTC and multiplayer games. Others noted SCTP’s adoption problems, like lack of support on some platforms and issues with firewalls. There was praise for the clear benchmarks, and hope that more apps will use SCTP in the future.

Now, a simpler but useful tool: a web app that lets you print a whole year’s calendar, like 2026, on one page. The calendar fits any paper size, is best in landscape, and is made to be easy to read, fold, and write notes on. The design is simple: each month is in a table, and you can see the whole year at a glance. The code is open source, and you can change it if you want.

Hacker News users liked the clean, ad-free design. Some use similar printed calendars for work, planning, or tracking goals. Others liked it for families and students. There were suggestions to add holidays or color-code weekends, but most agreed the strength is in the tool’s focus and simplicity. Some liked that it’s offline and free from big companies. Developers were interested in how it fits every paper size and handles leap years. Overall, people thanked the creator for making something small but helpful.

Next, a story about MacThrottle, a small macOS app to show when your Mac is slowing down because of heat—called thermal throttling. The author wanted to know when his MacBook Air or Pro was getting hot, since some Macs don’t have fans and make no noise. He tried Apple’s official tools, but they did not show enough detail. After research, he found that the system’s thermald service writes the real thermal status to notifyd, and you can read this value in Swift without needing special access. He built a menu bar app that shows a colored thermometer icon, a graph of temperature and fan speed, and sends alerts when the Mac gets too hot.

Early versions needed a helper script with root access, but the new way does not. To show temperature, the app uses the SMC API, which is tricky and changes between Mac models, but falls back to other methods if needed. The graph uses the Mac’s GPU for smooth drawing, and users can set the app to start at login.

Hacker News users liked the simple design, and many said they also want better ways to know when their Macs are getting too hot, especially on fanless models. Some asked for more features, like logging data over time, or tips to reduce throttling. Others warned that using private APIs can break with new Mac models. Some said Apple should show this info by default. There were questions about battery use and if the app works on older Macs. A few shared other tools, but most agreed better thermal info is useful, especially for heavy tasks like coding or video editing.

Now, let’s talk about Phantas, a web tool to help people reach a “flow state” using sound and light from the browser. It uses the Web Audio API, plays different sounds in each ear (binaural beats), and flashes the screen to help your brain get into a certain rhythm. You use headphones and let the screen shine through your closed eyelids. The main program is called “ALPHA (10Hz),” which is meant for routine work or coding. You can log how you feel before and after, and track your progress.

Hacker News commenters had mixed views. Some were excited, saying they had tried similar tools and found them helpful. Others were skeptical, saying science is not clear about the effects of binaural beats and flashing lights. Some worried about risks like triggering seizures for people with epilepsy. There were questions about safety warnings, and some remembered old programs that did similar things. Most agreed it’s a fun experiment but not a miracle cure. Many liked that it is open and works in the browser, making it easy to try.

That’s all for today’s episode. We saw the ups and downs of open source, lessons from tech leaders, the risks of security bugs, and the value of both simple and advanced tools. Thank you for listening to Hacker News Daily Podcast. We’ll be back tomorrow with more stories. See you next time.
