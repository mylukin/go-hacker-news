Hello everyone, this is the 2025-09-20 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have a wide range of stories for you, from tiny USB displays and kitchen knives with ultrasonic tech, to the history of Mac multitasking, machine translation, and even knitted models of the human body. Let’s get started.

Our first story is about the WeAct Display FS, a small, cheap USB display that you can add to your computer for just about $2. The screen is only 0.96 inches wide, with a 160x80 color display, and it uses a reversible USB-A plug so you never have to worry about plugging it in the wrong way. You can display text, weather, images, or use it as a mini-monitor for your PC or even a Raspberry Pi. There are two programs for the display: one is open source and works on Windows, Linux, macOS, and Raspberry Pi OS, as long as you have Python 3.9 or higher; the other lets you use it as an extra monitor, but only on Windows and it is not open source. There’s also a bigger 3.5-inch version for about $11.

In the comments, people are excited about the low price and the chance to hack the device. Some wish for a standard protocol for small displays, hoping it could help with recovery on headless machines. Others say that Linux now has a generic USB display protocol, which might make these screens plug-and-play. Security is a worry—some joke about “Chinese spyware,” and others warn that any USB device could pretend to be a keyboard and steal data. Some users are interested in reprogramming the device, and there’s talk about the microcontroller it uses. A few complain that the display is out of stock, and others want better host-to-display protocols. There’s also a mention that USB HID already supports small RGB displays, which could be helpful for these projects. Overall, people like the price and hackability, but worry about security and software support.

Next, we look at a new kitchen tool: the world’s first ultrasonic chef’s knife, made by Seattle Ultrasonics. The main product, the C-200 Ultrasonic 8" Chef’s Knife, uses a Japanese steel blade and is powered by a battery you can charge with USB-C or a wireless charging tile. When you turn on the ultrasonics, the blade vibrates very fast, letting it glide through food with less force and less sticking. The company says this means cleaner cuts and easier slicing for cheese, meat, or veggies. The knife costs $399, or $499 with a wireless charger, and is only available for pre-order now, with shipping planned for January 2026.

Hacker News users are curious but cautious. Some are excited to try new tech in the kitchen, while others think the price is high and wonder if it’s really better than a sharp regular knife. Some point out that ultrasonic knives are used in factories, but aren’t sure it makes sense at home. There are worries about cleaning, battery life, and safety, plus jokes about having to charge or update your knife. Some think it could help with sticky foods, but many say a good sharp knife already solves most problems. People want to see real reviews before they buy. In the end, there is curiosity, but also a lot of skepticism.

Now to Apple’s new 40W Dynamic Power Adapter, which can actually provide up to 60W when needed. The charger is nearly the same size as Apple’s old 20W charger but charges new iPhones and even MacBooks much faster. It costs $39, has foldable prongs for travel, and supports USB PD 3.0, giving different power levels depending on the device. For example, it charges an iPhone 17 to 50% in about 20 minutes, and can charge a MacBook Air M3 at nearly 56W.

Inside, the charger is tightly packed with quality components, including a custom chip that controls charging and sensors that keep things cool and safe. The design allows for fast charging in a small, tough package. Commenters are impressed by the power in such a small charger, but note that the price is high compared to similar products from Anker or UGREEN, which sometimes even have more ports. Some wish the Apple charger had two USB-C ports instead of one. Others praise the quality and safety of the design, but worry about repairability and e-waste, since Apple chargers are hard to fix. Some say Apple is late to fast charging, and wonder why older, less powerful chargers are still sold at high prices. Many hope for more ports and even faster charging in the future.

Next, we have a story about NotebookLM, an AI-powered note-taking tool designed by Jason Spielman and his team at Google. Their goal was to solve the problem of “tab overwhelm,” giving users a single place to collect ideas, chat with AI, and create outputs like study guides. NotebookLM uses a three-panel layout: one for your sources, one for AI chat, and one for outputs. The team worked through many sketches and user feedback to make the tool simple but flexible. Features include “Audio Overviews,” letting users listen to summaries of their notes.

Hacker News users liked the three-panel layout, saying it solves the headache of switching between too many apps. Some wonder if adding more features could make things crowded or confusing. Others ask if the AI can really understand complex notes, and there are questions about privacy and data safety. Some people worry that Google might drop support for the product, as it has with other tools. Overall, people agree that making note-taking easier and reducing app switching is a good direction.

Another creative story today is about Knitted Anatomy, a project where the human body’s systems are made out of yarn by knitting. The models include the heart, lungs, kidneys, and blood vessels, all in colorful, friendly 3D shapes. The idea is to use knitting to make anatomy less scary and more fun to learn, especially for students and kids. The models are soft and safe, and can be used where real organs or plastic models are not allowed.

In the comments, people are impressed by the skill and creativity. Some say these knitted models make learning anatomy more memorable than flat images. Others see them as useful for classrooms and museums. Some wonder if the idea could help teach about diseases or surgery. There are questions about how accurate the models can be, and stories from readers who learned with physical models. Some just enjoy seeing art and science combined, and there’s a light-hearted mood, with jokes about getting grandmas to knit biology homework.

Our next story is about the world of English bell ringing, and how rules for ringing changed over time. In the 1600s, English churches added wheels to bells, letting people ring in special patterns called “methods.” This became a complex art using math and order. For a long time, the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers had strict rules about what patterns were allowed. In 2011, Alexander Holroyd created a new method where some bells “jump” more than one place at a time, leading to debates about tradition versus creativity. After years of argument, the council changed to a new system in 2022 that allows more freedom and new ideas.

Commenters were surprised by the math and history involved in bell ringing. Some liked the rules for keeping tradition, others supported the new changes. There’s talk about how similar fights between tradition and change happen in other hobbies. Some say opening up the rules could help get young people interested. Many enjoyed learning about this part of English culture for the first time.

Switching gears, we look at why some gamers invert their controls—pushing down to look up, like in flying games—while others use the default way. Scientists ran tests and found that choice is less about habit or game history, and more about how your brain handles 3D space and movement. People with strong spatial skills are less likely to invert, while those who switch between styles are often slower at mental tasks. The research suggests you can learn either way, and that knowing your style could help in other jobs, like flying planes or surgery.

In the comments, people compare this to how you scroll on a mouse or trackpad. Some say it’s good that people can adapt, and that the research could help in real jobs. Others share stories about learning to change controls, and some point out that different cultures might have different “natural” styles. There’s surprise that it’s about brain skills, not just habits.

Now, we cover the history of machine translation, starting from Babel Fish, the first free online translator, to today’s AI tools like Google Translate. Early translators were famous for funny mistakes, like turning “Shakespeare’s works” into “Shakespeare’s factories.” Modern AI is much better, especially for common languages, but still struggles with rare languages, jokes, and cultural details. The article argues that while machines are great for quick translation, humans are still needed for important or creative texts.

Hacker News users remember using Babel Fish and laugh about its mistakes. Some are amazed by the progress of machine translation, but say they still trust humans for important work. There are worries about job loss for translators, and debates about whether AI can ever “understand” language. Some point out that machine translation helps people communicate who otherwise couldn’t, but warn against trusting it for everything. Most agree that both machine and human translators are needed.

Let’s move to the story of how Macs went from running just one app at a time to full multitasking. Early Macs could only run one program, and later used tools like Switcher and MultiFinder to let users swap between apps, though only one could run at a time. In 1988, Unix brought preemptive multitasking, where the system could force apps to share time. Over the years, Macs got more powerful, adding threads, dual-core processors, and in 2009, Grand Central Dispatch (GCD), which manages queues of tasks for better performance. Modern Macs can run many apps and background tasks at once, using up to 32 CPU cores.

In the comments, someone points out that Grand Central Dispatch is named after Grand Central Terminal, not Grand Central Station. Others remember old tools like Switcher and say they prefer using Spaces over Stage Manager. There’s respect for the history of Mac multitasking, and some nostalgia for simpler times, but also praise for the new tools.

Our last story today is about using Haskell to help solve a hard 3D wooden puzzle: a 5x5x5 cube box filled with 25 identical pieces shaped like notched “trunks.” The author tried to solve it by hand, but turned to Haskell for better modeling. The puzzle is represented as a grid of 1x1x1 voxels, with each piece defined by its positions. The code checks all possible rotations and placements, using Haskell’s math libraries to filter out impossible moves. Only the valid placements are kept, setting the stage for solving the puzzle by code.

Commenters liked the use of Haskell’s type system and mathematical ideas. Some worried that trying every possible placement might be slow, but agreed it’s a good first step. There were suggestions for other solving methods and requests for more diagrams. Many enjoyed seeing real-world problems modeled in Haskell, and appreciated the clear explanations.

That’s all for today’s episode. Thank you for listening to Hacker News Daily Podcast. We hope you enjoyed these stories and insights from the tech world. See you next time!
