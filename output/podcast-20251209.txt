Hello everyone, this is the 2025-12-09 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have stories about the future of technology, new software releases, open-source wins, clever tools, and news from both the web and the real world.

Let’s start with a fun look at what tech news might be like in 2035. Someone made a fake Hacker News front page using AI to imagine future headlines. The top story is about SpaceX’s Starship sending data from the Moon’s Sea of Tranquility. Another post says Linux now has a 100% Rust kernel, showing how far Rust could go. There are stories about running big AI models on contact lenses, using WebGPU to display 5D shapes, and buying an over-the-counter CRISPR treatment for lactose intolerance. Some posts talk about old topics with a twist, like fixing a 2024 Framework Laptop or using Tailscale with Starlink. Microsoft 365 is rumored to cost $40 per user, and Google is shutting down Gemini Cloud Services. Other headlines include IBM maybe buying OpenAI, a fresh Debian release, better tools for stopping deep fakes, and the return of server-side rendering. There’s even a post about rewriting sudo in Zig, playing GTA VI on RISC-V, and a text editor that proudly does not use AI.

In the comments, people laugh at how AI mixes real trends with wild ideas, but some say it feels too close to reality. Jokes about “old” tech, like a 2024 laptop or the return of server-side rendering, get lots of likes. Some think the news about Linux and Rust is not so far off, while others worry about real problems like privacy and ad-injection in AR. Many enjoy the creative ideas—photonic circuits, CRISPR in stores—but doubt they will really happen so soon. Some debate if AI will slow down or become more human-like. Playing GTA VI on RISC-V makes people smile, and others remember when running Windows in the browser sounded crazy. Most agree this “future HN” is a clever mix of real trends, old memories, and tech dreams, and it makes everyone think about where we are heading.

Now let’s move to open-source video. PeerTube, a free and open-source video platform, has just been named a digital public good by the Digital Public Goods Alliance. PeerTube lets anyone host, share, and stream videos or live broadcasts. It is made by Framasoft and is used by schools, governments, and activists around the world. The code is open and available on GitHub and Framagit. You can run your own PeerTube server, so no one company controls everything. This helps keep video sharing open and free.

On Hacker News, users praise PeerTube as a strong alternative to YouTube. People like its open source and peer-to-peer tech, which helps with bandwidth costs. Some think the user interface could be better, and discoverability is still a problem. Many like its support for many languages, and some worry about copyright and moderation on independent servers. Overall, most see PeerTube’s recognition as a digital public good as a big win for the open internet.

Next, Django 6.0 is out, bringing new features to this popular Python web framework. One big change is template partials—you can now define small parts of templates and reuse them, which keeps code cleaner. There is a new Tasks framework for running background jobs, so you do not always need third-party tools like Celery. Security gets a boost with built-in Content Security Policy support, making it easier to protect your site. The email system uses modern Python APIs, making things smoother and less buggy. Other changes include better shell commands, improved support for database fields, and 64-bit IDs by default.

The comments are full of excitement. People like template partials and the new Tasks framework, though some wish for a full worker to be included. CSP support is seen as overdue but very helpful. Some are happy about the switch to BigAutoField, as many ran into limits with the old IDs. Most think Django 6.0 is a solid, thoughtful release, and a good time to upgrade, though some want to wait for their favorite packages to catch up.

Let’s Encrypt is celebrating ten years of giving out free security certificates for websites. When it started in 2015, it was hard and expensive to get HTTPS. Now, Let’s Encrypt issues millions of certificates every day, and about 80% of web traffic is encrypted—95% in the US. They have added support for different domains, wildcards, and even IP addresses. Their goal is to make web security simple, but they remind everyone not to forget their work and to support them if possible.

Hacker News users are thankful. Many remember how hard web security was before Let’s Encrypt. Some wish for more features, like better support for private networks, and others worry about relying on a single certificate authority. But most agree that the web is much safer now.

Mistral has released Devstral 2, a new open-source AI coding model, and a command-line tool called Vibe CLI. Devstral 2 comes in two sizes: a big model with 123 billion parameters, and a smaller one with 24 billion. Both are open and can handle real code tasks, like working across files and fixing bugs. The small model even runs on a normal computer. Vibe CLI lets you chat with Devstral in your terminal, get code help, and edit files, all with project-wide context.

People are excited about the results, especially since small models can now compete with bigger ones. Running Devstral Small 2 locally is seen as a win for privacy. There are questions about how well it matches closed models like Claude Sonnet or GPT-4, and discussions about licenses and hardware needs. Some are already using Vibe CLI and sharing their feedback.

Next, an article looks at “vibe coding”—using AI to write code—and asks, why not let AI write in C or assembly, or even a new language just for machines? The author feels torn: AI coding is fast and powerful, but less satisfying than coding by hand. He wonders if programmers will just write ideas or tests, and let AI do the rest. In the comments, some agree, saying human-friendly languages may become less important, but others think we still need to read and check AI code. Some are excited for the future, while others worry about trust and safety.

Now for something creative—Bruno Simon’s online portfolio is a 3D website where you drive a car to explore his projects. Built with Three.js and other web tools, the site feels like a mini-game, with secrets and public messages called “whispers.” The code is open source, and the music is free to use. On Hacker News, people love the playful design and smooth graphics. Some ask about performance and accessibility, and others are inspired to build their own interactive sites.

For developers working with Qt in the browser, debugging WebAssembly apps can be tough. A new article explains how to use DWARF symbols and a special Chrome extension to debug directly in the browser. You build your app in debug mode, load it in Chrome, and use the extension to see your code and set breakpoints. Comments say this is a huge improvement, though support is still limited to Chrome, and debug builds get big. Some hope for better tools in other browsers and more guides for new developers.

A new device called Pebble Index 01 is a smart ring that lets you record voice notes by pressing a button and speaking. It stores your thoughts and sends them to your phone, turning them into text or reminders—all without the internet. The ring has a long-life battery and works offline, with all processing done on your phone. It’s private and secure, and the software is open source.

People on Hacker News like the focus on privacy and the simple design. Some worry about the single-use battery and losing such a small device, but others see many uses, from reminders to helping people with ADHD. Developers like the open software and easy customization. Some want more features, but most are excited to try it.

Our last story is about a travel boycott from Canada to the US. The boycott started as a protest against US policies, with Canadians choosing to spend money at home. The result is mixed: US border towns have fewer Canadian shoppers but are finding new ways to attract local customers. Canadian border towns are also feeling the loss, with fewer US visitors and less work. Some say the boycott is not hurting big companies, but does affect small businesses on both sides. People in the comments think the boycott sends a message, but also brings problems nobody planned for. Many believe both countries should work together instead.

That’s all for today’s episode. We hope you enjoyed this mix of future tech, open-source wins, creative projects, and thoughtful debates. Thank you for listening, and see you next time on Hacker News Daily Podcast.
