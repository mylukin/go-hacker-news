The article from Clarkesworld Magazine explores the history and fascination with the planet Jupiter, from Galileo's early observations to modern space missions. Galileo discovered Jupiter's four largest moons in 1610, changing our view of the solar system. Over time, writers and scientists have imagined visiting Jupiter, and new technology has brought us closer to understanding its atmosphere and moons. Jupiter formed after the sun, influencing the rest of the solar system. Early astronomers, like the Babylonians and the Greeks, were intrigued by its movements. The heliocentric model by Copernicus and observations by Galileo furthered our understanding. Science fiction writers like Jules Verne and Arthur C. Clarke have used Jupiter as a setting, influenced by scientific discoveries.

The article also discusses NASA's missions to Jupiter, such as the Pioneer and Voyager programs, which revealed much about its moons and atmosphere. Modern missions like Juno and upcoming ones like Europa Clipper aim to learn more about Jupiter and its potential for harboring life. Authors continue to draw inspiration from these missions, imagining life or colonies on Jupiter's moons in novels.

In the Hacker News comments, users reflect on how science and fiction inspire each other. Some think fiction leads to technological advances, while others believe technology sparks new stories.

## Deep learning gets the glory, deep fact checking gets ignored

- 原文链接: [Deep learning gets the glory, deep fact checking gets ignored](https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2025-06-04-enzyme-ml-fails/index.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44174965)

The article by Rachel Thomas discusses how deep learning gets a lot of attention and praise, while the important task of fact-checking these AI models often goes unnoticed. She highlights a case where a deep learning model predicted enzyme functions, leading to a high-profile publication, but follow-up work revealed many errors in those predictions.

The main story revolves around two research papers. The first used a transformer model to predict enzyme functions and got published in a top journal, Nature. The model made predictions for enzymes with unknown functions, claiming success based on testing a few predictions. However, many of these claims were later found to be wrong. The errors were uncovered by experts who noticed that some predictions were biologically impossible or already known, showing the pitfalls of relying on AI without deep domain knowledge.

The article emphasizes that the publication system favors flashy AI results, even if they are flawed, over the meticulous work of verifying those results. It shows that while AI can propagate known data, it struggles with truly unknown areas. The author suggests that more support is needed for research that checks AI outputs and integrates expert knowledge.

In the comments, some users agree that the system rewards AI papers more than fact-checking. They note that incentives in academia push for new, exciting findings over solid, verified results. Others highlight the importance of domain expertise, saying that without it, AI predictions can be misleading or incorrect. A few users mention that this issue isn't just in biology; it’s a problem across many fields using AI. They call for changes in how research is evaluated and funded, suggesting that more focus should be on the quality and accuracy of the work rather than its novelty.

## Ask HN: Options for One-Handed Typing

- 原文链接: [Ask HN: Options for One-Handed Typing](item?id=44173581)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44173581)

A discussion on Hacker News explores options for one-handed typing, sparked by a person whose family member injured their dominant arm. The main ideas for solutions are: training to type with one hand, remapping keys to favor one side, and using specialty keyboards, although these can be costly.

Some users suggest simply using a regular keyboard with one hand, which can be effective for temporary injuries. Others recommend remapping keyboards to mirror layouts, allowing the left hand to cover right-side keys. Some users share experiences with split keyboards like the Kinesis Freestyle2, which can be adapted for more comfortable use. Voice dictation tools, like Talon and Superwhisper, are also mentioned as helpful alternatives for typing without hands. Some people propose using text macros to speed up typing or trying specialty keyboards designed for one-handed use. There's also interest in using software to adjust keyboard layouts, such as QMK and kmonad, which can automate the process of mirroring keys. While specialty keyboards like Maltron and TiPY are discussed, many emphasize practical, cost-effective solutions like using free software or repurposing existing hardware.
