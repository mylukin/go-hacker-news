Hello everyone, this is the 2025-10-13 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have a full set of stories for developers and tech fans. Let’s jump right in.

First, let’s talk about NanoChat. This is a project that shows how you can build a basic ChatGPT-like chatbot for around $100. The goal is to make a simple, end-to-end large language model that’s easy to read, change, and run on your own GPU server. You can train, fine-tune, test, and chat with your model, all in one place. The “speedrun” script lets you set up and train the model in about four hours if you rent a server with eight H100 GPUs. After training, you get a basic chatbot you can use from your browser, similar to ChatGPT, but much smaller.

NanoChat is not as powerful as real ChatGPT. It’s more like chatting with a small child—the model can answer questions, write poems, and sometimes make things up. The model and data are much smaller due to the cost limit. The code works on different GPU types, and you can still train with just one GPU, though it will be slower. The project is open source with the MIT license, and easy to copy or change.

Hacker News users are happy with how clear and simple NanoChat is. Many say it’s a great way to learn LLMs without a big budget or team. Some like its easy-to-read code, while a few note that $100 is still a lot for some people, especially without good access to GPUs. There are questions about using it with home computers or cloud credits, and how to make the model bigger or better. Some compare it to other open-source projects, and many see it as a good start for personal chatbots. In the end, people call it inspiring, but agree it’s not a replacement for top commercial chatbots.

Next, a team from the University of Southern California has made a new device that can guide light without needing switches or outside controls. This device follows the rules of thermodynamics, letting light find its own way, like how heat spreads in a gas. In normal electronics and photonics, we use routers and switches to send signals, but controlling light is hard and often slow. The USC team’s device uses the natural behavior of light in nonlinear systems. In their experiment, light moves through two steps, like a gas balancing out, and always ends up in the right place.

This idea, called optical thermodynamics, could be big for future tech. If light can route itself, chips and networks can be simpler and use less energy. It could help with faster computers, better networks, and safer data. Hacker News users are excited, calling it a clever way to use nature instead of fighting it. Some point out that nonlinear systems are hard to control, so making this work is impressive. There are questions about energy use, how it compares to normal switches, and if it can handle large data in the real world. Some are careful, saying not all cool optical ideas make it to market, but most agree this is a hopeful step for photonics.

Now, let’s look at SQLite Online. This is a web-based SQL editor, built by one person over 11 years, now serving 11,000 users a day. The new feature is a way to make charts with SQL, using special commands like QLINE-SELECT, QAREA-SELECT, QBAR-SELECT, and more. These commands let you turn SQL results into line, area, bar, or pie charts right in your browser. You can use data from a CSV file, pick which columns go on the X and Y axes, set colors, and see results instantly.

People on Hacker News are impressed by the solo developer’s work, calling the tool useful and easy for sharing, learning, and teaching SQL. Some suggest features like better mobile support or more export options. There are questions about privacy and ideas to improve the chart syntax. Many wish they had a tool like this when learning SQL, and some share stories about running similar tools and the challenge of handling high traffic. Most comments are positive, thankful, and respectful.

Moving on, we have a story about root cause analysis, or RCA. The article says most people do RCA the wrong way by looking for just one simple cause for failures in complex systems. Real problems happen because of many factors working together, not just one bug or setting. The author shares a real example from work, where a team blamed a setting for a failure, but missed deeper issues like unclear design, bad defaults, and poor testing.

The better approach, called CAST, looks at the whole system, builds a timeline, and asks many questions to find all the weak spots. The author explains that accidents happen when a system is in a risky state and meets bad luck, and that human error is just the start, not the end, of the analysis. Good analysis looks at both technical and social factors and aims to control risks, not just chase every bug.

Hacker News readers agree that real accidents are always more complex than they look. Many share stories where blaming one root cause missed bigger problems, and say managers like simple answers. Some mention the “Five Whys” method and how it often stops too soon. Others warn that big companies push for quick, shallow analysis. The general feeling is that systems thinking is hard but needed, and deeper methods like CAST or blameless postmortems are better.

Next, let’s talk about configuration files. The article says the main problem with config files is not syntax—like YAML or JSON—but the lack of abstraction. Many people switch formats hoping to make things better, but the real problem is copy-paste and repetition. The author shows that with abstraction, like loops or variables, you can write shorter, safer configs that are easier to update.

Tools like Cue, Dhall, Jsonnet, and RCL help reduce repetition, but even simple scripts can help. The trade-off is that generated files can be harder to search and debug, so the author suggests checking in the generated files. Some people prefer simple data for small configs and worry about “configuration drift” if files get out of sync. Others say good editors and linters can help. Most agree that for big projects, abstraction is more important than clean syntax, and want better tools to balance code and data in configs.

On to security, Apple has added new features to iOS to make the kernel safer. The main tools are SPTM, TXM, and Exclaves. SPTM splits memory into safer zones, TXM checks that only signed code runs, and Exclaves move private tasks outside the main kernel. These parts talk through special channels, making it harder for hackers to break in. Even if someone hacks the kernel, they can’t reach the most protected areas.

Hacker News users are impressed by Apple’s focus on security. Some worry these changes make it harder for developers and security researchers. A few note that the design is like older microkernels, and wonder if this will end jailbreaking. There are questions about performance, bugs, and if Android will follow. Some hope Apple can balance security with user control. Most agree it’s a strong step for security, even if not perfect.

The Dutch government has taken control of Nexperia, a big chipmaker, to protect important technology from foreign influence. Nexperia was owned by a Chinese company, and the Dutch worried that its tech could be used for spying or by China’s government. Now, the Dutch have special rights to stop risky sales or decisions. This is part of a trend in Europe and the US to protect key tech companies, especially with rising tension with China.

Some on Hacker News say the government is right to protect important companies, while others worry about too much state control hurting business. Some point out that China does the same, and this could make tech and trade more difficult between countries. There is debate about how much risk there really is, since Nexperia’s chips are basic, not top-end. Some think this is about sending a message to China, and others are sad to see global business get harder. Most agree that each country must put its own security first.

Next, there is a post about a 1943 US government film called “Don’t Be a Sucker.” The movie warns against racism and hate, showing how hate can break a country and lead to disaster, as happened in Nazi Germany. The film calls on everyone to stand together against those who try to divide us.

On Hacker News, people say the film is still important today. Some see it as a strong lesson, while others note that even the US has not always followed its own advice. There are talks about how propaganda can be used for good or bad. Some remember seeing the film in school and wish more people would watch it now. There are worries that such lessons are often forgotten, and that history can repeat itself. Most agree the film’s message still matters.

Now, let’s look at making PostgreSQL faster with JIT compilers. The article explains that it’s hard to make a JIT that’s much faster than the interpreter, because modern CPUs are already very good at running code with tricks like branch prediction. The author shares code examples and shows that inlining common operations gives a speed-up, but the CPU is already doing a lot.

Hacker News users agree that interpreters are fast now, and JIT compilers help more with complex or repeated queries. Some warn that too many special cases can make the codebase messy. There are also comments about the limits of what you can gain, and encouragement for more optimization. Some suggest looking at tricks used in other databases. Overall, the work is seen as useful, but there are limits to what can be done with interpreter or JIT changes alone.

Finally, let’s talk about JSON River, a small and fast streaming JSON parser written in TypeScript. Unlike JSON.parse, which waits for the whole file, JSON River lets you start working with data as it arrives. This is useful for big files or slow networks. You get “partial” results as the data grows, and the final result is the same as with JSON.parse. It has no dependencies and follows JavaScript standards.

Hacker News users like the simple, modern approach. Some say it’s great for APIs or AI models with long responses, or for data pipelines. Others compare it to tools like stream-json, noting that JSON River is simpler and faster but with fewer features. There are questions about error handling and partial values, and requests for more benchmarks. Overall, the response is positive, with many technical ideas and suggestions.
