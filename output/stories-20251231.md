This article is about a computer science professor who decided to cancel his book deal with a big publisher. He wanted to write a book of fun, classic programming projects, but the publishing process became frustrating and not what he hoped for.

At first, the publishers seemed helpful and excited about his idea. He listed some good things about working with a publisher, like help with editing, logistics, and distribution. But there were many bad things too: low pay, constant nagging, strict deadlines, and the publisher wanting too much control. The advance was only $5,000, and royalties were low—12% at first, then 15% later, with most books selling only a few thousand copies. He had to use their writing tools and follow a strict style guide. The publisher pushed him to make the book easier and less personal, even asking for a chapter teaching Python basics, which he didn’t want to add. Later, they also pressured him to include AI content, which didn’t fit his idea of classic programming projects. He kept missing deadlines due to work and life events, like getting married. The editing feedback was sometimes helpful but often missed the point of his book. In the end, he wasn’t enjoying the process anymore, so he paused the project. The publisher finally ended the contract, returning all rights to him. Now, he plans to self-publish the book, selling chapters as he finishes them.

In the comments, some readers supported his choice, saying publishers often make things harder and pay very little. Others shared their own bad experiences with publishers, agreeing that self-publishing gives more freedom and can make more money if you already have an audience. Some people were surprised at how little publishers help with marketing, and how they still want control over the book’s direction. A few comments pointed out that publishers' insistence on adding AI to every book shows they care more about trends than the author’s vision. Some suggested that using tools like Gumroad or Amazon makes self-publishing easier today. Others said that the author’s blog is already popular, so he doesn’t need a publisher to reach readers. But a few people warned that self-publishing can be hard work, especially for editing and distribution. Some liked the idea of releasing chapters one by one, while others worried about readers losing interest if the book is not finished quickly. Overall, most commenters felt the author made the right choice, and many said they would buy the book when it comes out.

## All-optical synthesis chip for large-scale intelligent semantic vision

- 原文链接: [All-optical synthesis chip for large-scale intelligent semantic vision](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adv7434)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46447827)

This article talks about a new chip that uses only light, not electricity, to help computers understand pictures and meaning. The chip is called an “all-optical synthesis chip” and is made for large-scale, intelligent vision tasks.

The main idea is that normal chips use electricity to do work, but this chip uses light. Light can move much faster and use less energy. The chip can look at images and find meaning, which is good for things like self-driving cars or smart cameras. Using light, the chip can process a lot of data very quickly. It can also handle images and language at the same time, helping computers understand what they see and what it means. The chip is small, so it can fit in many devices. It also does not get hot like normal chips. The article says this chip can do tasks that need both looking at images and understanding language. This could help make AI smarter without needing huge computers. The chip could make devices faster and save power. It uses special materials and designs to control how light moves inside it. The researchers built the chip in a lab and showed it can work with real data. They hope this technology will be used in phones, cars, and robots in the future.

In the comments, some people are excited and say using light is the future of computers. Others think it will take a long time before this chip is common. Some users ask if it will be easy to make these chips in large numbers. A few people wonder if it works with current AI software or needs new programs. One person thinks this chip could help with big problems like saving energy in data centers. Another says the chip might only work for special tasks, not for all computer jobs. Some are worried about the cost of making the chip. Others want to know if it is easy to use or if it needs special skills. A few users ask if this will really help AI, or if it is just a small step. Some are hopeful, saying this is the start of a big change in computer design. Overall, readers are interested but have many questions about how soon this will be used and how much it will really change things.

## Privacy and control. My tech setup

- 原文链接: [Privacy and control. My tech setup](https://toidiu.com/blog/2025-12-25-privacy-and-control/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46446938)

The article talks about how the author protects their digital life, focusing less on privacy and more on control over their data and devices. The main idea is that “privacy” means different things to different people, but if you think about “control”—who decides what you see, what ads you get, or even how you vote—the need for better tech habits becomes clearer.

The author explains that many popular tools, like Gmail, WhatsApp, and Facebook, make life easy but take away some control and give it to big companies. They share their own setup to keep more control. For passwords, they use GNU pass, a simple manager that doesn’t give data to others, and only use it on their laptop, not their phone, for safety. For messaging, they prefer Signal over WhatsApp but still have to use WhatsApp for family. Venmo is disabled for privacy. Their phone runs GrapheneOS, which is a special Android that lets you block, disable, or sandbox apps—so Google and other companies can’t do whatever they want on your device. Open-source apps from F-Droid are used when possible, and they avoid social media apps on their phone, using browser containers instead.

For email, the author uses their own domain, making it easy to switch providers. They currently use Tuta for secure and affordable email, since they don’t want to host their own server. When browsing the web, they use Firefox with privacy add-ons to block tracking and ads. Their calendar and contacts are hosted on a Raspberry Pi at home, syncing with their phone using DAVx⁵. For their domain, they use Cloudflare Registrar because it’s cheaper, and for DNS, they use Cloudflare’s service, trusting their business model more than competitors.

In the Hacker News comments, many people agree that “control” is a better term than “privacy.” Some say that feeling in control can help people make better choices with tech. Others point out the trade-offs: for example, using only a laptop password manager is safer but less convenient. Some users say open-source tools are great but can be hard to use for non-technical people. A few wish they could avoid WhatsApp but feel stuck because it’s what everyone uses. People debate if Cloudflare should be trusted, since it’s still a big company, while some praise their transparent business model. Some commenters like the idea of hosting your own calendar and contacts, but others warn it’s too much work for most people. There’s discussion about how hard it is to balance convenience and control—most agree it’s not all or nothing, and everyone has to find their own middle ground. A few note that even with these steps, you can never be fully in control, but doing something is better than nothing. Others share extra tips, like using multiple browsers, or running everything in virtual machines, but admit it can be tiring. Overall, readers appreciate the practical advice and honest look at what’s possible—and what’s hard—when you care about digital control.

## Demystifying DVDs

- 原文链接: [Demystifying DVDs](https://hiddenpalace.org/News/One_Bad_Ass_Hedgehog_-_Shadow_the_Hedgehog#Demystifying_DVDs)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46417162)

The article is about the long and complex process of saving a lost prototype of the video game "Shadow the Hedgehog" from an old, damaged DVD. The authors from Hidden Palace worked with many other fans to recover the data and explain how DVDs work along the way.

First, they talk about how Sega and the Sonic franchise changed after Sega stopped making game consoles. Sonic games started to follow trends instead of making them, and some games, like Shadow the Hedgehog, tried to be more "mature" and cool, but ended up feeling awkward and forced. The article explains how Shadow's own game, with guns and a dark story, was strange for fans. It didn't get good reviews, but it still sold well.

The main focus is the effort to save a rare "Beta 4" prototype disc of Shadow the Hedgehog, which was almost unreadable. The team used around 200 different DVD drives, tried different software, and even learned new ways to read data from very old, broken discs. They explain how CDs and DVDs store data as tiny pits and lands, and how DVDs use special codes to correct errors if there is damage. Most DVD drives hide the error correction data from users, which makes it hard to fix problems when a disc is damaged. The team found that some drives could give back more "raw" data, including the hidden correction codes.

To really save the prototype, they built a new tool called DiscImageMender (DIM). This tool takes many partial disc dumps and uses the error correction codes to piece together the best possible image. For the Shadow prototype, they did hundreds of dumps, merged good sectors, and fixed bad ones. In the end, almost all sectors were fixed, and then they found another copy of the disc that matched their fixed image exactly, proving their method worked.

In the comments, many users share praise for the technical depth. Some are surprised at how much work goes into preserving old games and how complicated disc technology really is. A few share their own stories about trying to read old CDs or DVDs and the frustration when drives won't cooperate. Some commenters focus on the importance of projects like this for game history, saying these efforts keep lost media alive for future generations. Others talk about the value of open-source tools that help with data recovery and wonder why disc makers hid so much useful data from end users. A few worry about how many old discs are now unreadable due to disc rot and bad storage, and that more will be lost if not saved soon. There are also some jokes about how Shadow the Hedgehog's "edgy" style hasn't aged well, but the hard work to save the prototype is still respected. Finally, several users thank Hidden Palace and similar groups for their patience and passion, saying that this kind of work is a real gift for fans and history.

## The compiler is your best friend

- 原文链接: [The compiler is your best friend](https://blog.daniel-beskin.com/2025-12-22-the-compiler-is-your-best-friend-stop-lying-to-it)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46445131)

This article says that compilers are not your enemy—they are actually your best friend when you write code. It shows how working with the compiler, instead of fighting it or hiding things from it, can save you from many bugs and headaches.

The article explains what a compiler is and how it works in languages like Rust, Java, and TypeScript. Rust’s compiler is strict and checks for memory safety and ownership before your program runs, so you catch problems early. Java uses a different style, with bytecode and a just-in-time (JIT) compiler, and TypeScript compiles to JavaScript, helping you add types slowly to big codebases. The type system—the part checking if things fit together—matters most for regular programmers.

But many developers “lie” to the compiler. This happens when you say one thing in your code, but something else can happen when the program runs. For example, you might say a value is a string, but it could also be null, which can cause a crash later. Or you use exceptions, type casts, or functions with hidden side-effects, making it hard for the compiler to help you. These lies make the compiler less useful and bugs harder to find.

The article says you can stop lying by using types that show what’s really happening. For missing values, use Option types instead of null. For errors, use Result or Try types to show if something failed. Avoid casts by making your types more precise. Try to separate pure functions (which always give the same output) from side-effect functions (which change things outside). This helps the compiler check more of your logic.

Once you stop lying, you can go further and use the compiler to encode your business rules. You can wrap simple types like strings and ints in new types (like UserId or AppId), so you never mix them up. Use union types or enums to show different cases, making illegal states impossible to write. You can even use types to make rules like “this list is never empty” or “this number is always positive.” With these tricks, if your code compiles, it’s often already correct.

In the comment section, some readers agree that strong types and working with the compiler help catch bugs early and make big changes safer. People share how using Option or Result types in Rust or Haskell made their code more reliable. Others say that sometimes, fighting with the compiler feels slow and annoying, especially for quick scripts or small projects. A few point out that too many types or too strict rules can make code harder to read or write, and that sometimes you need to move fast.

Some developers mention that not all teams or companies let you use fancy type systems or change the style, especially in old codebases. Others stress that you still need good tests, because the compiler can’t check everything. A few bring up that in languages like Python or JavaScript, adding types is still not as smooth, though tools are getting better. Some highlight that the real win is clearer communication with your future self and teammates, not just pleasing the compiler.

Many agree with the main message: if you help the compiler help you, you’ll find bugs sooner, your code will be easier to change, and you’ll sleep better at night. But they also warn not to get lost in types—focus on making your code clear and useful for people, too.

## Akin's Laws of Spacecraft Design [pdf] (2011)

- 原文链接: [Akin's Laws of Spacecraft Design [pdf] (2011)](https://www.ece.uvic.ca/~elec399/201409/Akin%27s%20Laws%20of%20Spacecraft%20Design.pdf)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46442903)

Akin’s Laws of Spacecraft Design is a list of lessons and rules about engineering, written in a fun and direct way. The laws share advice on how to design complex things like spacecraft, but most of the ideas work for any engineering project.

The first law says engineering needs numbers, not just opinions. You must measure and compare to know if something is better, faster, or cheaper. Another law says you can never make a perfect system—so design things to work even when something goes wrong. Design is always changing; just when you think you are done, you find more to improve. Sometimes your best ideas will not make it into the final product, and you need to accept that.

The laws warn against finding fake patterns in data, remind you not to trust every analysis just because it is printed, and say you should not fall in love with your tools. If someone wants to be the leader too much, they might not be the right choice. The best solution is often in the middle, not at the extremes. You should not wait for perfect information to start working—estimate if you must, but go back and fix things when you know more.

It is okay to throw out everything and start again if that is the best way forward. There is rarely only one right answer, but there are many wrong ones. Do not build things better than the requirements, because clients do not want to pay for extras they do not need. “Better” can be the enemy of “good enough.” Interfaces between systems are where most problems and improvements happen. Past work is not always right, and you should check everything yourself.

Experience helps, but too much can stop new ideas. If your numbers are too good to be true, check your work—you are probably wrong. Good design needs good presentation; if you cannot explain it, people will not accept it. Education is about learning what is useful and what is not. Document everything, especially problems. Schedules are often too hopeful, and work grows unless you control it.

After a failure, do not hide mistakes—learn from them. Do not do anything dumb, and remember the basics. Schedules always get longer, and nothing is ever really free. Costs and time estimates are always too low at first. Drawing skills help, because designs often follow early sketches. You cannot reach big goals just by small steps; sometimes, you need something new.

Sometimes, things work only when no one important is watching. Quick, good action is better than waiting for perfect plans. Use what you have, where you are. The best design is simple, with nothing extra. Responsibility matters—be clear about who did what. New capabilities change what is possible. Avoid making brand-new launch vehicles; use what works. Space is dangerous, and mistakes can kill people—nature cannot be fooled.

In the comment section, many people praise these laws as funny but very true. Some say they wish they had learned this in school, not just from hard experience. Others point out that these rules fit not only for space engineering but for all types of projects. A few share stories where following (or ignoring) these laws led to success or failure in their own work. Some argue about whether “good enough” is always enough, or if sometimes you must push for better.

Several commenters highlight the law about documentation, saying it really helps teams work together and not repeat mistakes. Others like the advice to start with what you have, instead of waiting for something better. Some joke about schedules always slipping and say it matches their daily work. A few people note that the laws are a mix of humor and hard truth, and that engineers everywhere face the same problems.

One commenter warns about the risk of ignoring past experience, while another says too much respect for tradition can block new solutions. Some users debate if leadership can be taught, or if some people are just not suited to lead. Many agree that trying to hide or “explain away” mistakes is one of the worst things an engineer can do. Overall, the community finds these laws helpful, honest, and sometimes a little painful—because they are so accurate.

## Microtonal Spiral Piano

- 原文链接: [Microtonal Spiral Piano](https://shih1.github.io/spiral/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46390312)

This article is about a web tool called Spiral Synth, a piano that lets you play and explore microtonal music using your computer keyboard. The creator made it to help people learn about different musical tunings from around the world, not just the standard Western system.

The tool lets you change how many notes are in an octave. Normally, Western music uses 12 notes per octave (12-TET), but Spiral Synth also supports 19, 24, 31, and 53 notes per octave. These other tunings help you play music from different cultures, like Arabic or Turkish music, or music from the Renaissance. You can use your keyboard to play notes, and the layout is shown so you know which key plays which pitch. The tool also has sound controls, like volume, reverb, and envelope settings (ADSR), so you can shape how each note sounds. You can even change the waveform, add effects, and see chords in a circle or a tower to help understand harmony.

The main idea is to make it easier for people to try and understand microtonal music. The creator hopes musicians will get inspired to use more than just the common Western notes and discover new sounds. There's also a quick start guide to help you use the tool, whether you play piano, guitar, or just want to experiment with music.

In the comment section, some people are excited about being able to try out these unusual tunings so easily. They say it's a great way to hear what music from other cultures or older times sounded like. A few users share stories about learning microtonal music and how hard it was before tools like this existed. Others discuss how the keyboard layout is smart, but mention it might be tricky at first for users who are used to a normal piano. Some wonder if the tool could help composers write new types of music, or if it could spark more interest in microtonal music in general. A few suggest extra features, like saving custom tunings or adding MIDI support. Some users say they wish they had this tool when they were learning about music theory, while others appreciate the sound design options. There are also comments about how visualizing chords as circles or towers helps people understand harmony better. A couple of users ask about the math behind the tunings and are curious about how the spiral design was chosen. Overall, people like that this tool makes microtonal music more accessible and fun.

## My role as a founder-CTO: year 8

- 原文链接: [My role as a founder-CTO: year 8](https://miguelcarranza.es/cto-year-8)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46395438)

This post is about the founder-CTO of RevenueCat sharing what year eight at the company was like. He talks about almost selling the company for a huge amount, but then choosing to keep building instead.

He explains how the app development world is changing quickly, with new trends like “vibe coding” and easier ways to build apps. RevenueCat almost got bought, which would have made him and his co-founder very rich, but they decided not to sell. They felt the company was just getting started and had a lot more to do. The founder says selling means you lose control, and the company’s special culture often changes after an acquisition. To make staying independent easier, they raised more money so they could feel safer and not worry about personal finances. He says talking to other founders who kept their companies helped him decide, and his wife’s support was important too.

The founder’s main goals for the year were to build an app, network more, talk to customers daily, and exercise. He traveled a lot, met users and team members, and tried to make each trip useful. He spent much time hiring, especially trying to find a VP of Engineering, but did not rush and kept standards high. He focused on culture, making new rules and shared ideas inside the company to help people work better together. He started a new team, the “Office of the CTO,” to try new projects and solve hard problems quickly. Some of his biggest mistakes were spending too much time on executive hiring, letting hiring slow down, and moving people between projects too soon.

He also shares small lessons: hiring great people brings more great people, managers need coaching, and that networking only works if it happens naturally. Personally, he says that exercise and family support helped him handle stress, and that being open with the team was good for everyone.

In the comments, many readers praise the honesty and detail in the post. Some say it’s rare to see founders talk so openly about the stress and hard choices of startup life. Others discuss the decision not to sell—some think it was brave and inspiring, while a few wonder if turning down so much money was risky. People like how the founder focuses on company culture and not just growth. There is interest in the idea of “vibe coding” and how making app development easier changes the industry. Some comment that hiring and keeping good people is the hardest part of growing a tech company; others agree that hiring mistakes can cause big problems. A few share their own stories about selling or not selling companies, saying that both choices are hard in different ways. There are also comments about the founder’s tips on exercise and balance, with readers saying it’s important but difficult for startup leaders. Some readers are curious about the technical changes mentioned for the next year, especially the new backend. Overall, people find the story motivating and realistic, showing both the good and the tough parts of being a founder.

## When square pixels aren't square

- 原文链接: [When square pixels aren't square](https://alexwlchan.net/2025/square-pixels/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46443988)

The article talks about a problem with showing videos on web pages: sometimes, the pixels in a video are not actually square, even if you think they are. The author explains that they noticed some videos did not fit right in their web layout, causing letterboxing or page jumps. 

They thought the issue came from how they calculated the video’s aspect ratio, which they got from the video’s pixel width and height. But they found out this was not enough because some videos use non-square pixels, making the video appear wider or taller than expected. Videos have three important numbers: storage aspect ratio (SAR, the raw width and height), pixel aspect ratio (PAR, which tells if pixels are square or not), and display aspect ratio (DAR, which is SAR times PAR and tells the real shape of the video on screen). For example, a video might be stored as 1920x1080 but have a PAR of 45:64, so it really displays as 1350x1080. The author gives examples using ffprobe and ffmpeg to show how to check these values and explains how to fix the code to use display aspect ratio instead of just storage aspect ratio. They also show Python code to do this, using the fractions module to avoid rounding errors.

The author says non-square pixels are rare today but still happen, especially in some YouTube Shorts and old TV formats. They suggest always using the display aspect ratio to avoid bugs when showing videos.

In the comments, some readers say they remember non-square pixels from old television days and early digital cameras. Others note that many video tools and editors still do not handle pixel aspect ratio well, which causes problems for people working with video. A few users share stories about old video games and graphics where pixel shapes caused funny effects or needed special handling. Some developers say that web browsers should make this easier for people, so you don’t have to worry about aspect ratios in your code. Others disagree and think it is important for developers to understand these details, especially when working with media. One person points out that some new smartphone videos also have non-square pixels because of editing or social media platforms. Another commenter thanks the author for explaining the math and sharing working code. Some readers say they have run into layout bugs like this but did not know why until now. Others talk about other media metadata problems, and how missing or wrong info can lead to surprises in apps. Finally, a few people debate if this is a real problem today, or just a rare edge case most people can ignore.
