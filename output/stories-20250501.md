The article "Pwning the Ladybird Browser" is about finding and explaining a security vulnerability in the Ladybird browser's JavaScript engine, LibJS. Ladybird is a new browser from the SerenityOS project, and it's in early development. The author uses a tool called Fuzzilli to find bugs in the JavaScript engine. They run the fuzzer for 10 days and discover various crashes and bugs, including a use-after-free (UAF) bug, which is the main focus of the article.

The UAF bug happens because of how Ladybird handles JavaScript function arguments. When a function is called, it uses an argument buffer that can be freed (or deallocated) and then used again, leading to potential security issues. The article details how this bug can be exploited to leak memory addresses and potentially alter program execution. The author suggests a fix by changing the order of some operations in the code to avoid the bug.

In the comments, people discuss the security and development aspects of the Ladybird browser. One commenter, awesomekling, praises the write-up and mentions that the Ladybird team is working on improving memory management and security. Another commenter, safercplusplus, suggests a technique for avoiding such bugs by using non-resizable vectors. There's also a discussion about the choice of C++ for the project, with some suggesting moving to Swift or C# for better memory safety. Others talk about the challenges and benefits of building a browser from scratch, while some express concerns about the security of C++ and the project's future direction. Overall, the comments reflect a mix of technical insights, development challenges, and future possibilities for the Ladybird browser.

- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43856795)

The article talks about a judge ruling that an Apple executive lied under oath, leading to a criminal contempt referral. The executive, Mr. Roman, made false statements about Apple's plans relating to fees on purchases made outside their app store, which the judge deemed misleading and dishonest.

The court document reveals that Mr. Roman, Apple's Vice President of Finance, lied about Apple's decision-making process regarding fees for external purchases. He claimed Apple only decided on a 27 percent fee in January 2024, but evidence showed this wasn't true. The judge was not impressed and referred the case for potential criminal charges. This situation has sparked conversations about the integrity of Apple's leadership and their business practices.

In the comments, people have mixed feelings. Some think the executive should face charges to set a precedent against lying under oath. Others doubt any serious consequences will happen, believing powerful executives often escape punishment. Some discuss the impact on Apple's stock, speculating that the company might face financial setbacks due to the case and other unrelated issues, like underperforming sales in China. There are also debates about Apple's corporate culture, with some blaming CEO Tim Cook for the company's current state, suggesting it's time for new leadership. Some comments focus on Apple's business model, particularly their control over app payments, which some see as both a protective measure for users and a monopolistic practice that harms developers.

- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43852266)

The article discusses a detailed 108-billion-pixel scan of Johannes Vermeer's "Girl with a Pearl Earring." This scan was created using a Hirox 3D digital microscope, capturing over 2 million images and stitching them together. The technology allows viewers to zoom in and explore tiny details of the painting. The scan is not just a flat image; it includes a 3D representation, enabling a deeper exploration of the artwork. This high-resolution image is valuable for art restoration, helping experts study the painting’s surface, pigments, and any cracks or restorations.

In the comments, people discuss the painting's details and how our brains fill in gaps when viewing art. Some users compare this technique to impressionism, where close examination reveals a "mess," but from a distance, the art is cohesive. Others mention how Vermeer may have used optical tools like a camera obscura to create his works, sparking debate on whether this diminishes or enhances his artistry. Additionally, the scan's technology impresses many users, with some dreaming of owning such advanced microscopes.

The discussion also touches on general art appreciation. Some commenters reflect on their personal experiences viewing famous paintings in museums. Others debate the merits of modern sci-fi books, linking the idea of "filling in gaps" in both literature and art. Overall, the comments highlight a mix of admiration for the scan's technological achievement and a deep appreciation for the original artwork's enduring beauty and mystery.

## A faster way to copy SQLite databases between computers

- 原文链接: [A faster way to copy SQLite databases between computers](https://alexwlchan.net/2025/copying-sqlite-databases/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43856186)

The article talks about a faster way to copy large SQLite databases between computers. The author shares how using SQLite's `.dump` command to create a text file from the database can significantly reduce file size, especially by not copying the indexes, which are a major cause of the database's large size. Compressing this text file with gzip makes it even smaller, allowing for quicker downloads.

The method involves creating a compressed text file of the database on the server, transferring it, and then reconstructing the database on the local machine. This approach not only speeds up the download process but also ensures a consistent copy, avoiding corruption issues that occur when databases are updated during a file transfer.

In the comments, some users suggest using SQLite's official rsync tool, which works at the page level and might be more efficient. Others mention using the `VACUUM INTO` command for creating minimal backups, though it doesn't address the index problem the article discusses. There are discussions about whether compressing text files is more efficient than binary files, with opinions varying based on the specific use case.

Some commenters highlight alternative tools like Litestream for safe database replication, which might be more suited for ongoing synchronization rather than one-off transfers. There's also a mention of using the `sqlite3_rsync` utility, which is optimized for SQLite databases, though it requires the database to be in WAL mode. Lastly, some commenters humorously note how this method gives techies a chance to take a break while files transfer, poking fun at the constant push for efficiency.

The article talks about Julia Parsons, who was a U.S. Navy code breaker during World War II, and sadly, she has died at the age of 104.

Julia worked to decode enemy messages, which played a key role in the war efforts. Her work helped the Allies gain crucial information, which was vital for their success. Code breakers like her worked in secret and often didn't get recognition during their lifetimes. Their efforts were critical in many battles, including the famous D-Day landings. Julia's passing marks the end of an era, as fewer World War II veterans are still with us. It reminds us of the importance of remembering their stories and sacrifices.

In the comments, many people expressed sadness about losing the World War II generation. Some shared personal stories about their grandparents, who also had incredible experiences during the war. One person mentioned visiting historical sites like Normandy, which brings the history to life and helps us connect with the past. Another commenter recounted a brief encounter with a World War II veteran and shared a poignant poem about the dangers faced by those in service. There was also a discussion about the name "Julia" and whether the Julia programming language was named after the code breaker, which it wasn't. Overall, comments reflected on the impact of these veterans' lives and the importance of preserving their memories.
