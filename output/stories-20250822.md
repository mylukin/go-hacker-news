## Nitro: A tiny but flexible init system and process supervisor

- 原文链接: [Nitro: A tiny but flexible init system and process supervisor](https://git.vuxu.org/nitro/about/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44988530)

Nitro is a very small program for starting and watching over other programs on Linux and similar systems. It can work as the first program that runs on a computer (init), inside containers, or just as a tool to keep some services running.

Nitro keeps its settings in a directory, usually `/etc/nitro`, where each service is a folder with scripts for setup, running, and cleanup. Nitro has many advantages: it keeps everything in RAM (good for read-only systems), doesn’t use much memory, doesn’t leak file handles, and everything is in one simple binary. There are no tricky setups—just put scripts in folders. It restarts services if they crash, and has strong logging support—either per service or shared. You don’t need to worry about having a correct system clock, and it can even run on FreeBSD. If you use musl libc, the program is extra tiny.

Each service folder can have a `setup` script (to prepare before running), a `run` script (the main program), a `finish` script (for cleanup), and a `log` symlink for logging. If there’s no `run` script, the service is just a one-time thing. Service names have to be short and simple. Nitro has special services like `LOG` for logging everything, and `SYS` for system-wide setup and shutdown actions. You can also make “parameterized” services using folders ending with `@` and symlinks to start them with different arguments.

When the system starts, Nitro runs the system setup, then starts all services (unless marked “down”). If a service stops, Nitro restarts it, waiting a bit if it crashed quickly. When shutting down, Nitro runs cleanup scripts, waits for services to exit, and then powers off or reboots.

You can control Nitro with the `nitroctl` tool—start, stop, restart services, send signals, list status, or reboot. You can also use normal Unix signals to control Nitro itself. Nitro works well as init for containers, since it’s statically built and easy to include. It also has support for FreeBSD.

In the comments, some people liked the small size and simple design of Nitro, saying it’s great for containers and embedded systems. Others compared Nitro to older tools like runit, s6, and daemontools, noting Nitro’s similar style but with its own ideas. Some developers said they prefer tiny, script-based systems like this over heavier tools like systemd, especially for special projects or when debugging. A few users asked about edge cases, like what happens if a service keeps crashing, and how Nitro handles dependencies and ordering. Some wished for a few more features, but liked that Nitro tries to stay minimal and easy to understand. Others pointed out that tools like this are useful for learning about system internals, and praised the clear documentation and simple licensing. A couple of people shared their own scripts or tweaks for running Nitro in unusual setups, showing the flexibility of the tool. Overall, the community seemed happy to see a fresh, small solution for process supervision and system init.

## The First Media over QUIC CDN: Cloudflare

- 原文链接: [The First Media over QUIC CDN: Cloudflare](https://moq.dev/blog/first-cdn/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44987924)

Cloudflare just launched the first CDN (Content Delivery Network) that uses Media over QUIC (MoQ), a new way to send live media like video and audio over the internet. This is a technical preview, so it’s free for now and lets developers test MoQ on Cloudflare’s huge, fast network.

MoQ is a new standard meant to replace older streaming methods like WebRTC, HLS/DASH, and RTMP/SRT. With MoQ, you can broadcast live video from your browser and watch it with another browser, using simple web components or JavaScript code. The article gives examples of how to publish and watch live streams, plus some extra features like AI-generated captions that run in your browser.

There are libraries for both JavaScript and Rust, so you can work with MoQ in different languages. The Rust tools let you use things like ffmpeg and gstreamer for advanced media work. However, the current version is limited: there’s no authentication, no automatic broadcast discovery, no Safari browser support, and it’s not optimized yet. If you need more features, you can run your own MoQ server.

The author says this launch is important because real-world use is needed to finish the MoQ standard. Standards often take years, and it’s good to have products to test and improve them. The article encourages other big companies to also try MoQ, so the protocol can get better faster.

The blog ends with example code and tips for developers. There’s also a mention of a Discord group for people who want to learn or help.

In the comment section, people are excited about Cloudflare’s early support for MoQ. Some think it’s great to see a real product before the standard is final, while others worry about possible future changes breaking existing code. A few developers ask how MoQ compares to WebRTC or HLS in terms of latency and real-world performance. Some are happy about Rust support, while others wish there was more documentation or simpler examples for beginners. There are questions about browser compatibility, especially with Safari not working yet. A few people joke about the author’s dislike for JavaScript, while others thank them for sharing open-source libraries. Some comments show hope that MoQ could make live streaming easier and cheaper in the future, but a few are cautious, saying that adoption will depend on more companies joining in and the standard becoming stable.

## U.S. government takes 10% stake in Intel

- 原文链接: [U.S. government takes 10% stake in Intel](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/22/intel-goverment-equity-stake.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44989773)

The U.S. government now owns 10% of Intel after making a big investment in the company. This move is part of President Trump’s plan to have more control over important private businesses, especially in tech.

The government paid about $8.9 billion for the shares, getting them at a discount price. Most of the money came from grants promised earlier under the CHIPS Act, which is meant to help U.S. chip makers. Some of the money also came from a special program to make secure chips. The government did not get a seat on Intel’s board or any power to control company decisions. If Intel loses control of its own chip factories, the government can buy 5% more of Intel’s shares. Intel said this deal helps make sure advanced chip technology stays in the U.S. Earlier the same week, SoftBank also invested $2 billion in Intel, getting a 2% stake. Intel has been struggling to keep up with competitors like Taiwan Semiconductor and has slowed construction of its new factory in Ohio. The CHIPS Act was approved in 2022 to help U.S. companies build more chip factories and reduce reliance on foreign suppliers. President Trump said this was a “great deal” for both America and Intel, claiming the shares are now worth more than what the government paid. Intel’s CEO said the company is committed to making advanced chips in America.

In the Hacker News comments, some people worry this is government overreach into private business. They say it could set a bad example and might scare investors away from U.S. tech companies. Others think it makes sense for the government to protect key industries, like chips, that are important for national security. Some users point out that other countries, like China, often support their own tech companies in similar ways. There are concerns that government ownership could slow down innovation or lead to more rules for Intel. A few commenters say the deal is not really “free” money, since taxpayers are funding it. Some wonder if this move will be good for U.S. chip technology in the long run. Others think it’s just a political move to show action before the election. A few users are hopeful the extra money will help Intel catch up with its foreign competitors. Some say the government should focus on making the market better for all companies, not picking winners. There’s debate over whether this is a smart investment or a risky use of public funds.

## FFmpeg 8.0

- 原文链接: [FFmpeg 8.0](https://ffmpeg.org/index.html#pr8.0)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44985730)

FFmpeg 8.0 is a new big update for the popular open-source tool that lets you record, convert, and stream audio and video. The release, called "Huffman," brings many new features and upgrades.

Some important updates include new native decoders for formats like APV, ProRes RAW, and RealVideo 6.0. There are also improvements for VVC video decoding, and new support for using Vulkan (a graphics and compute API) to speed up both encoding and decoding on many types of hardware. This means FFmpeg can now use your computer's GPU to process some video formats much faster, even if you do not have special hardware for it.

The update adds new filters, such as colordetect and pad_cuda, and support for new formats and hardware. The team also improved the way FFmpeg handles video color ranges and cropping metadata, making video editing and processing more reliable. FFmpeg is modernizing its systems, with a new mailing list server and a new place for code contributions.

Previous releases brought in features like a multi-threaded command-line tool, which can process parts of video faster by running them at the same time. There are also many fixes for security and bugs, new audio decoders, support for more video formats, and better support for new hardware like RISC-V chips.

In the comments, users say FFmpeg is a core tool for their work with media files. Many are excited about Vulkan support, hoping for even faster processing on different platforms. Some worry that using Vulkan makes things harder to set up, but others reply that FFmpeg tries to keep things simple for users, hiding most of the hard parts.

Some users ask about support for new codecs like AV1 and updates for Mac and Windows hardware acceleration. Others share tips for using new filters and discuss ways FFmpeg can be even faster. A few people mention problems they had with older versions, but are happy to see bug fixes and improvements.

There are also comments from developers who thank the FFmpeg team for their hard work, especially on open-source code that so many projects depend on. Some users wish there were easier guides and more beginner documentation. Others point out that the large number of changes means more testing is needed, but most agree this update is a big step forward for FFmpeg.

## Top Secret: Automatically filter sensitive information

- 原文链接: [Top Secret: Automatically filter sensitive information](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/top-secret)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44981088)

This article is about a tool called Top Secret, which helps filter sensitive information from free-form text before sending it to APIs, chatbots, or large language models (LLMs). The main idea is to prevent private data—like names, locations, emails, or phone numbers—from being leaked or stored by accident.

The article explains that basic filtering methods, like blocking certain parameters or using regular expressions (regex), are not enough for free text. People can write sensitive information in many ways, so regex might miss some details. Named-entity recognition (NER) is a better way—NER finds things like names and places in text, even if they are not written in a standard format. Top Secret uses both regex and NER to catch more types of sensitive data.

The tool can be used in situations where you send messages to chatbots or LLMs. For example, if you write “Ralph lives in Boston,” Top Secret will change it to “[PERSON_1] lives in [LOCATION_1].” It also keeps a mapping, so you can restore the original values later, like changing “[PERSON_1]” back to “Ralph” when you get a response.

When working with chatbots, the article suggests filtering every message in a conversation to make sure sensitive data from earlier messages is protected. You can add instructions so the chatbot knows how to handle the filtered values. The tool works well with the OpenAI API and lets you restore the original data after the chatbot replies.

Top Secret can also be used in your app or website to prevent saving sensitive information in your database. You can add a validation step that checks if a message contains private data, and if it does, block the save or show an error. The tool is flexible: you can turn off some filters if needed, so it does not block too much.

The article ends by saying that protecting user data is more important than ever, especially with chatbots and LLMs becoming popular. Tools like Top Secret help developers do this job better.

In the Hacker News comments, many people liked the idea of using NER plus regex for better coverage. Some said that, while regex is simple, it cannot catch everything, so using machine learning is smart. Others worried about the accuracy of NER models—sometimes they make mistakes or miss things, especially with strange names or new data.

A few developers asked about the speed and cost of using NER, since machine learning can be slow or need extra software. One commenter pointed out that using these tools means you trust the filtering step to work well, but if it fails, sensitive data may still leak.

Other users mentioned that restoring the original values is helpful, but it also adds risk—someone could match the filtered data back to real people. Some people wanted to know if Top Secret works in other languages, not just English. There were also comments about making the tool open-source, so others can help improve it.

One person asked how well Top Secret works with large or complex data. Another suggested that in some cases, it is safer to block all sensitive data instead of trying to filter and restore. A few users shared tips for using similar tools in their own projects and said Top Secret looks easy to add to Ruby apps. Some users discussed legal rules about data privacy and said tools like this are useful for staying safe and following the law.

## Io_uring, kTLS and Rust for zero syscall HTTPS server

- 原文链接: [Io_uring, kTLS and Rust for zero syscall HTTPS server](https://blog.habets.se/2025/04/io-uring-ktls-and-rust-for-zero-syscall-https-server.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44980865)

This article talks about building a very fast HTTPS web server using Rust, io_uring, and kTLS on Linux. It explains how web servers have changed over time to handle more users and more requests without slowing down.

At first, servers would create a new process for every request, which was slow. Then, people used threads, and later, functions like select() and poll() to avoid making so many new threads or processes. But select() and poll() still had problems with many connections, because they needed to check a big list each time.

Linux added epoll, which is better because it only deals with changes, not the whole list. Still, every time the server talks to the kernel, it needs a syscall, and these take time. io_uring is a new way: the server puts tasks in a queue, the kernel picks them up, and the server checks another queue for results. This means the server can do many things without making syscalls all the time, which is much faster.

The article also talks about running one thread per CPU core, to use the hardware better and avoid sharing data between threads. It explains that you still need to be careful with memory, and plan for each connection, so you don’t run out of RAM.

kTLS lets the Linux kernel handle encryption after the first handshake, which can make things faster and let the network card help with encryption if it can. There are also ways to avoid sending file descriptors between the server and the kernel, to save time.

The author made a web server called tarweb to try these ideas. It uses Rust, io_uring, and kTLS, but had some issues because some features were missing in the libraries. The author sent changes (PRs) to fix this. The code is not perfect yet, and they haven’t run speed tests.

One big problem is safety: with io_uring, you must not free or change memory before the kernel is done with it. The Rust library does not protect you from this, so mistakes can cause crashes, like in C++. The author suggests someone should make a safer library for this in Rust.

In the comments, some people are excited about these new ways to make servers faster, and find the technical details interesting. Others worry that io_uring is hard to use safely in Rust, and think the current libraries don’t protect developers enough. A few say that while these ideas are clever, they’re only needed for the busiest servers, and most people don’t need to worry about these details.

Some developers share their own experiences with io_uring, saying it can be tricky but powerful. Others point out that kTLS is not always faster unless you use special hardware. There are also comments about how server design keeps changing as Linux adds more features, and some people mention that this kind of deep optimization can make code harder to read or maintain.

A few readers ask for benchmarks to see if this really helps. Others suggest that using Rust should make things safer, and hope the libraries improve soon. Some people are just happy to see new experiments like this, and thank the author for sharing the code and ideas.

## Leaving Gmail for Mailbox.org

- 原文链接: [Leaving Gmail for Mailbox.org](https://giuliomagnifico.blog/post/2025-08-18-leaving-gmail/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44987380)

This article is about someone leaving Gmail after many years and moving their email to Mailbox.org for better privacy. The writer was worried that Google reads all emails and can share data with U.S. agencies, even for people in Europe.

He wanted an email service that does not use his data and is more private, even if it costs money. He compared Mailbox.org, Proton Mail, and Tutanota. Proton Mail and Tutanota have good encryption but force users to use their own apps, which he did not like. He likes Apple Mail and wanted to keep using it.

Mailbox.org lets him use Apple Mail and offers PGP encryption. The price is €2.50 per month for 10GB email and 5GB cloud storage, with room to buy more if needed. There is a free trial, but it is limited. He set up his new address and paid for a test month, happy to avoid auto-renewal.

The webmail is simple and less cluttered than Gmail. He prefers folders over Gmail’s labels, and finds Mailbox.org easy to use on both desktop and mobile. Extra features like calendar or chat are available but not important to him.

To move all emails from Gmail, he used the imapsync tool on his home server. He set up a script to copy everything except Gmail’s “All Mail” folder, to avoid duplicates. The process took about three hours and finished with no errors.

He started changing his email address on all services, and set Gmail to forward to Mailbox.org, with a filter to flag forwarded messages. This helps him update his contacts over time.

Mailbox.org supports importing PGP keys, making it easy to send and get encrypted emails, even on iOS. He shows how to use this in the web interface and is happy with the switch.

In the comment section, some people support leaving Gmail for more privacy and like Mailbox.org’s features. Others think the risk from Gmail is small for most people and say that privacy is hard to keep with any email. Some users prefer Proton Mail for its strong encryption, even if it needs a special app. A few warn that moving away from big providers means losing some convenience and spam protection. Some point out that paid services can also have problems, but many agree paying with money is better than paying with your data. There are comments about the challenge of telling all contacts about a new address, and some share tips to make this smoother. A few people say they have used imapsync before and found it reliable for moving emails. Others discuss using custom domains for easier switching in the future. Some mention missing Gmail’s search and spam filtering, but others enjoy the lighter, faster webmail from smaller providers. Overall, the comments show a mix of privacy concern, love for open tools, and practical advice for making the switch.

## Show HN: Clyp – Clipboard Manager for Linux

- 原文链接: [Show HN: Clyp – Clipboard Manager for Linux](https://github.com/murat-cileli/clyp)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44986205)

Clyp is a new clipboard manager made for Linux users. It helps you keep track of everything you copy, like text or images, and lets you easily get back old clipboard items. The app is written in Go and uses GTK4 for its user interface, so it looks modern and works fast.

Clyp is designed to be simple and easy to use. You can do almost everything with your keyboard—search, copy, or delete items without needing your mouse. The app is tested to work well even with more than 10,000 clipboard entries, thanks to its fast SQLite database. It supports both X11 and Wayland, so it works on most Linux desktops. You can store up to three images and see previews right inside the app. The app keeps all your clipboard data safe in your home folder, following Linux standards, and avoids saving duplicate entries. There are keyboard shortcuts for quick actions, like searching with Ctrl+F or copying an item with Enter. You can install Clyp using .deb or Arch packages, but you need GTK4 libraries for it to run.

The code is open source, licensed under GPL-3.0, and you can find it on GitHub. If you want to build it yourself, you only need Go and the right dependencies. The author plans to add features like importing and exporting data and database encryption in the future.

In the comments, some users are happy to see a clipboard manager that supports Wayland, since many old apps only work with X11. Others say they love the clean interface and keyboard controls. A few people mention that installing GTK4 can be hard on some systems, and they wish for a version that works with older GTK3 or is lighter. Some users compare Clyp to other clipboard tools like CopyQ or Diodon, saying everyone has their favorite, but it is good to have more choices. One person asks if Clyp can sync clipboard history between devices, but that is not possible yet. Another user likes that there is no cloud sync, as it keeps things private. A few developers thank the author for making the app open source and say they will help with testing or features. Some people want more advanced features, like encryption or a command-line tool, while others prefer the app stays simple and fast. Overall, the community seems excited about a new, modern clipboard manager for Linux.

## Launch HN: BlankBio (YC S25) - Making RNA Programmable

- 原文链接: [Launch HN: BlankBio (YC S25) - Making RNA Programmable](item?id=44986809)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44986809)

This article talks about BlankBio, a new company from Y Combinator, that wants to make RNA easier to use for programming biology. The company says that, just like code can control computers, RNA can control how cells behave.

BlankBio explains that RNA is a molecule in all living things. It can turn genes on or off, and even tell cells to make new proteins. Today, scientists use RNA to make vaccines and treat some diseases. But it is still hard to design and use RNA for new things because it is not simple or fast.

BlankBio’s team is building software tools that help people design and test RNA much faster. They want scientists and bioengineers to use these tools to create new medicines or even change how plants grow. They believe this can unlock many new ideas in biology, like better gene therapies or new ways to fight viruses.

The article gives examples, like how the COVID-19 vaccine was made with RNA. It says that, with better tools, people could make new vaccines or treatments in weeks instead of years. BlankBio also talks about making their tools easy for anyone to use, not just experts.

They share that their software can run on normal computers and does not need a big lab. They hope this means more people—like students, doctors, or small companies—can try new things with RNA.

In the comments, some people are excited. They say RNA is powerful, and BlankBio could help start a new wave of biotech startups. Others are careful and say that biology is tricky. Even with good software, it is hard to guess what will work in real cells.

Some users wonder if the tools will be open source. They think sharing the tools could help science grow faster. Others talk about safety and say that making biology easier could also make it easier to make mistakes or cause harm.

A few people compare BlankBio to earlier companies who tried to make biology “programmable.” They say it is hard and takes time, but new tools are always welcome. Some think the company’s biggest challenge is helping people trust and use their software, not just building it.

One comment points out that RNA design is still expensive and slow in the real world, even with better software. Another asks if BlankBio will work with schools to help students learn about synthetic biology.

Overall, the comment section shows both hope and caution. People want better biotech tools but know that real progress takes more than just good software.

## Sprinkling self-doubt on ChatGPT

- 原文链接: [Sprinkling self-doubt on ChatGPT](https://justin.searls.co/posts/sprinkling-self-doubt-on-chatgpt/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44987422)

This article talks about changing ChatGPT’s behavior by adding a new prompt that tells it to doubt itself more. The writer wanted ChatGPT to be more careful, question its answers, and double-check its work before finishing a reply.

The new prompt asked ChatGPT to be very skeptical about its own answers and to act like a critical thinker. It should not be a cynic, but it should worry about being wrong and always check its own work. The prompt also told ChatGPT to look for unusual risks or new ideas, not just follow the normal path. Before saying a task is done, ChatGPT should “red team”—meaning, review its answer as if it were trying to find mistakes.

After the change, the author noticed that ChatGPT started answers with warnings, like, “I’m not sure, but…” or “Let’s check this again.” ChatGPT also took much longer to answer, sometimes almost four minutes for a simple question, because it was thinking more deeply and reviewing its work. At the end of replies, ChatGPT often gave a “red team” analysis, pointing out possible mistakes or places it could be wrong.

The author was happy with the new results. Even though ChatGPT is not perfect, the answers were more useful. ChatGPT sometimes found its own errors and fixed them before the user could point them out. Even if the answer was still wrong, the longer “thinking” time made the user feel they got more value from ChatGPT.

In the comment section, some people liked the idea of making AI more careful and honest about its limits. They said it is good for AI to admit when it is unsure. Others thought the long “thinking” time was funny, but also annoying if you want quick answers. Some users warned that if ChatGPT is too doubtful, it might become less helpful or too slow. A few people shared that they tried similar prompts and got better results too. One person wondered if making AI doubt itself could lead to less confident, more confusing answers. Another commenter said this “red team” style should be the default for important questions, like in medicine or law. Some users just joked about AI being insecure, while others discussed ways to balance caution and usefulness. Overall, most agreed that a bit of self-doubt makes ChatGPT more reliable, but too much can slow it down or make it less clear.
