GNU Unifont is a free font that tries to cover every character in the Unicode standard, so people all over the world can read and write in their own language. The project is part of GNU and has regular updates, with many volunteers helping to draw and improve the tiny images (glyphs) for every letter, symbol, or sign.

The main Unifont release includes glyphs for the Basic Multilingual Plane (the first 65,536 Unicode code points) and also covers parts of higher Unicode planes, like those for extra symbols or rare scripts. The font is available in different file formats, such as OpenType, PCF, and BDF, and there are special versions for Japanese users, APL programming, and even for people who want to experiment with the raw glyph data. You can use Unifont in commercial projects, thanks to its open licenses (GPL with special exception, and SIL Open Font License). If you change the font or make new versions, you need to share your changes with the public, giving credit to the original authors.

The project explains that making glyphs is real creative work, protected by copyright laws. Some glyphs, like special Chinese characters made by the Chinese government, cannot be used in Unifont because of legal restrictions, so volunteers have to draw their own. Unifont files try to store size and spacing information, but some programs do not use this, which can make the font look strange in certain tools, especially those made for fixed-width fonts.

Unifont has some limits: it only stores one glyph for each Unicode code point, so scripts that need letters to change shape, like Arabic or many Indian scripts, will not look good. For these, Unifont is only a “last resort” font, and users should use more advanced fonts when possible. The project invites anyone to help by drawing missing glyphs, but asks people to check first to avoid duplicate work.

Release notes show that many people from around the world help improve Unifont. Recent updates include better Chinese character shapes, new emoji, changes to Arabic and CJK glyphs, and the addition of glyphs for rare scripts and symbols. The project tries to keep up with new Unicode versions, adding new scripts and fixing mistakes quickly. There are tables and charts on the website, so users can check which characters are covered.

In the Hacker News comments, some people praise Unifont for its huge coverage and usefulness, especially for showing rare or missing characters in apps and terminals. Others say the font looks very simple or “ugly” because the glyphs are pixel-based and do not have smooth curves. Some users like that Unifont “just works” everywhere and is easy to use in technical or embedded settings. A few mention problems with displaying complex scripts, and recommend other fonts for good-looking text in those languages. There are discussions about the open licenses, with some people happy they can use Unifont in business or open projects, while others wish the font was even easier to modify. Some comment on the hard work needed for every update, and thank the volunteers who draw thousands of glyphs by hand. Finally, a few people share tips for installing Unifont on Windows or Mac and suggest tools for making or editing glyphs.

## macOS 26.2 enables fast AI clusters with RDMA over Thunderbolt

- 原文链接: [macOS 26.2 enables fast AI clusters with RDMA over Thunderbolt](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-26_2-release-notes#RDMA-over-Thunderbolt)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46248644)

Apple’s new macOS 26.2 update is out, and the big news is support for fast, low-latency AI clusters using RDMA over Thunderbolt. This means Macs with Thunderbolt 5 can now connect together and quickly share data for tasks like distributed AI inference, which could make running big AI models much faster and easier on Mac hardware. The update also fixes some bugs, like AirDrop problems between beta versions, an issue with Swift memory tracking in Instruments, and a virtual machine bug that broke iCloud in VMs.

A new StoreKit feature helps developers check the age rating of their apps. Some bugs with test subscriptions and status updates have also been fixed. There’s a note that Xcode 16.4 will only run on certain macOS versions. The update is mostly focused on making things smoother for app makers and users, with a few new features but lots of bug fixes.

Hacker News commenters are pretty excited about the RDMA over Thunderbolt feature. Many say this could make small, fast AI clusters easier and cheaper to build, especially for AI researchers and indie hackers. Some users wonder how easy it will be to set up and use in practice, and if regular users will ever need this. A few are curious if this means Apple will release their own AI cluster hardware or software tools to make it even simpler. One commenter warns that RDMA can be tricky and often needs special drivers or good documentation, which Apple is not always great at providing.

Others debate whether this will really compete with big cloud AI clusters, since Thunderbolt cables are short and you can only connect a few Macs together. Still, some think it’s a fun tool for experiments, classrooms, or developers who want to try running AI models across several cheap Macs. A few bring up past Apple tech that never took off, but most agree this is a big technical step forward for Mac users who care about AI and high-speed networking.

## Security issues with electronic invoices

- 原文链接: [Security issues with electronic invoices](https://invoice.secvuln.info/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46248470)

This article talks about security problems with electronic invoices in the European Union, which use a special XML format. The main issue is that these electronic invoices are getting more common, but the technology behind them is not always safe.

The EU wants businesses to use standardized, machine-readable invoices, but there are many formats and sub-formats, making things complicated. The XML format used for these invoices can have security flaws, especially something called XXE (XML External Entity) vulnerabilities. XXE problems can let attackers read files on a server or even steal data. Some programming languages and libraries, like Python and .NET, are safe by default, but others, like Java and the Saxon library (often used for invoices), are not safe unless you change the settings.

Another problem is with XSLT 2.0, which is a tool used to check if invoices follow the EU rules. Only one free tool, Saxon, supports this version, and it is not secure by default. This means many people using the official EU validation tools might be open to XXE attacks without knowing. The article’s author even talked to the group that manages these web standards, but the problem is still there.

There’s also a problem with getting the full set of rules (EN16931) for these invoices. Some parts are free, but others cost money and are hard to find, making it more difficult for developers to follow the rules and keep things safe.

The author tested many popular electronic invoice tools and found security holes in almost all of them. Some companies fixed the problems quickly, while others did not respond or still have open issues. The article lists all the products tested, what kind of vulnerability they had, and if or when it was fixed.

In the comments, some people agree that using XML for invoices is risky and too complex. They think the EU should have picked a simpler, safer standard. Others say that the problem is not XML itself, but how developers use it without understanding security settings. A few developers say it’s hard to keep up with all the changing standards and that buying the official rules makes things worse. Some people worry that having only one main tool (Saxon) for XSLT 2.0 is dangerous, since it creates a single point of failure. Others defend the need for flexible, machine-readable formats, saying that good security practices can solve these issues if followed carefully. A few commenters share their own stories of finding or fixing similar bugs in other business software. Some wish the EU would offer free, easy-to-use testing tools for everyone. Others are frustrated that after so many years, basic XML security mistakes still happen in new software. Finally, some say this shows why open bug reports and fast fixes are important for keeping everyone safe.

## Rats Play Doom

- 原文链接: [Rats Play Doom](https://ratsplaydoom.com/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46248323)

This article talks about a group building a VR system so real rats can play the video game DOOM. The team made a special machine using a treadmill ball, curved screen, sensors, and a reward system that gives sugar water when the rat does something right.

Their first version was simple: just a ball and sensors, and the rats could only move forward. The new version is much better, with a big screen that wraps around, better tracking, and a smarter reward system. The setup lets the rat walk on a ball to move in the game, pull a lever to shoot, and get sugar water as a prize. They even added air puffs and sound features to make the game feel more real for the rat.

The hardware can be built by anyone because all the designs and code are open source. The software uses Python and connects a PC to a Raspberry Pi, which handles sensors and rewards. Training the rats takes a few weeks, but the team’s rats got too old before full testing. So, while the system works, they still need to finish training and collect more data.

One important point: the system needs to be adjusted for each rat, like changing the trigger’s position or reward flow. There’s no automatic calibration, so users must set it up by hand.

In the comments, people had lots of different ideas. Many found the project funny and impressive, saying it shows what’s possible with open hardware and software. Some worried about the rats’ well-being and asked if VR is stressful for animals. Others think it could be useful for science, studying how brains learn or how animals react to virtual worlds.

A few users remembered similar experiments with mice or monkeys, and compared the build quality and openness of this project. Some thought it’s just a fun hack, while others saw serious research potential. There was also talk about the ethics: is it okay to make animals play games for our amusement, even with rewards? People liked that the instructions are public, but wondered who else might try this at home.

Finally, some commenters joked about “speedrunning” DOOM as a rat or how long it will take before a rat can beat a human player. Overall, the project sparked curiosity, amusement, and some deep questions about technology and animals.

## SQLite JSON at full index speed using generated columns

- 原文链接: [SQLite JSON at full index speed using generated columns](https://www.dbpro.app/blog/sqlite-json-virtual-columns-indexing)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46243904)

This article explains a cool trick for working with JSON data in SQLite. It shows how you can store JSON, use virtual generated columns, and add indexes to make your queries much faster.

The main idea is to keep your JSON data as it is, without breaking it into separate columns. You use SQLite’s JSON functions to pull out values from your JSON into virtual columns. These columns don’t actually store new data—they just show data from the JSON when you need it. You can then add indexes on these virtual columns. With indexes, your searches become much quicker, almost as fast as regular columns in a normal database.

If you later need to search by a new field inside your JSON, you just add another virtual column and index. You don’t have to change the whole table or move your data around. This makes it very flexible. You can change your queries as your app changes, without big updates or migrations.

The author gives step-by-step code examples. First, make a table with a JSON column. Next, add virtual columns that use `json_extract` to get fields from the JSON. Then, add indexes on these columns. Finally, run fast queries using these indexes. If you need more fields later, just repeat the process.

This approach lets you enjoy the easy storage of JSON and the speed of indexed databases. You don’t have to pick one or the other.

In the comment section, many people are surprised that SQLite can do this. Some say they didn’t know about generated columns or how easy it is to add indexes to them. Others think this is a smart way to get the best of both worlds—flexibility and speed.

A few commenters point out that this technique can make your database simpler, especially for small apps or quick projects. Some warn that you should still be careful: if your JSON structure changes too much, it can get messy or confusing. One person asks about performance for very large databases, but others reply that for many use cases, this is more than fast enough.

Some people also talk about using this trick in production. They say it works well if you know the limits of SQLite. Others share their own stories of using SQLite’s JSON features. There’s a lot of excitement about how powerful SQLite has become, especially for new apps.

Overall, people agree this is a useful pattern. It helps you move quickly and keep things simple, while also giving you fast search and easy updates when your data changes.

## 4 billion if statements (2023)

- 原文链接: [4 billion if statements (2023)](https://andreasjhkarlsson.github.io//jekyll/update/2023/12/27/4-billion-if-statements.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46174114)

This article is about a programmer who tries to check if a number is even or odd using only “if” statements, not normal math like modulus. He starts with a small C program that has one “if” for each number up to 10. The code works, but only for numbers 0 to 10. To handle more numbers, he writes a Python script that generates many “if” statements in C, covering all 8-bit numbers (0 to 255). This works, so he tries 16-bit numbers, making a huge C file with about 130,000 lines. The code still works and runs fast on his computer.

He then tries to scale up to 32-bit numbers, which means over 4 billion “if” statements. The generated C file is about 330 GB, too big for the compiler or operating system to handle. He realizes this approach won’t work because of compiler and file size limits. To get around this, he writes the logic directly in x86-64 machine code using Python, creating a 40 GB binary file with all the comparisons. He then writes a C program that loads and runs this binary code, checking if any 32-bit number is even or odd.

There is a bug when testing big numbers because the code uses “atoi,” which doesn’t handle large unsigned numbers well. He fixes it by using “strtoul” instead, and now the program works correctly for all 32-bit numbers. He notes that the program is surprisingly fast, even with such a large file, taking only about 10 seconds to check the highest numbers.

Commenters on Hacker News had many opinions. Some found the article funny and enjoyed the playful, “what if” approach. Others said it’s a good example of how not to solve problems, and joked about the huge waste of memory and time. Some pointed out that modern compilers and CPUs are very good at optimizing real solutions (like using modulo or bitwise operations), making this “if statement” method impractical for real apps.

A few commenters liked the creative use of code generation and meta-programming, saying it shows how computers can do repetitive work for us. Others discussed technical limits, like file size restrictions and compiler errors on huge source files. Some people wondered about possible real-world uses for giant lookup tables, but most agreed this is just for fun.

One commenter said it’s a good way to learn about time-memory tradeoffs, even if the example is silly. Another pointed out that the program’s “performance” is misleading, since it’s mostly about reading a giant file, not actual calculation speed. Some joked about the environmental impact of using so much disk space and memory for a simple problem.

Overall, the community saw this as a fun, tongue-in-cheek experiment that highlights the importance of using the right tool for the job, and the value of understanding both software and hardware limits.

## Pg_ClickHouse: A Postgres extension for querying ClickHouse

- 原文链接: [Pg_ClickHouse: A Postgres extension for querying ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/blog/introducing-pg_clickhouse)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46220411)

The article talks about pg_clickhouse, a new extension that lets you run ClickHouse queries directly from PostgreSQL. It aims to make it easier for teams to move from using PostgreSQL for analytics to using ClickHouse, without having to rewrite lots of old queries.

The main problem is that companies outgrow PostgreSQL for analytics as their data grows. Moving the data to ClickHouse is easy with tools like ClickPipes, but changing all the old SQL queries takes a lot of time. Pg_clickhouse solves this by letting you point your existing queries at ClickHouse tables, so the queries work as before but run faster. It works by using PostgreSQL’s foreign data wrapper (FDW) system, which lets you access other databases as if they are local tables. The team looked at older solutions like clickhouse_fdw but found they needed more updates and features, so they made their own with modern improvements.

The extension supports advanced query “pushdown.” This means most of the work, like filtering and aggregating data, happens in ClickHouse instead of PostgreSQL, which is faster. For example, it rewrites special PostgreSQL functions like percentile_cont to use ClickHouse’s quantile function. It also converts filter expressions, so queries with WHERE clauses or filters still work well. SEMI JOIN pushdown is another big feature. This helps with more complex queries and makes them run much faster.

Testing with TPC-H benchmark queries, the team saw big speedups, especially after adding better join support. There were still a few queries that didn’t get full pushdown, but most were much faster with the extension. The team has a roadmap to support even more types of queries, functions, and data types in the future.

In the Hacker News comments, some users are excited about how pg_clickhouse could help with analytics migrations, calling it a “game changer” for teams already using both databases. People like that it lets you avoid re-writing lots of old SQL, making big migrations less risky. Some wonder about compatibility with different versions of PostgreSQL and ClickHouse, and the authors confirm it works with recent versions. Others ask about performance, and users point out that true pushdown is key—the more work done in ClickHouse, the better the speed.

A few users share worries about possible confusion, since there are already other FDW extensions for ClickHouse. Some think it could be hard to keep feature parity as both PostgreSQL and ClickHouse change, but most agree this extension is a strong step forward. Some discuss edge cases, like very complex queries or differences in SQL syntax between the two databases, and wonder how well the extension handles them. Others suggest more documentation and real-world examples would help new users. Overall, most comments are positive, seeing pg_clickhouse as a helpful tool for teams with growing analytics needs.

- 原文链接: [Motion (YC W20) Is Hiring Senior Staff Front End Engineers](https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/motion/715d9646-27d4-44f6-9229-61eb0380ae39)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46248892)

Motion is a tech company building a work platform powered by AI agents, and they are hiring for a Senior Staff Frontend Engineer. The job is focused on rebuilding their frontend as they change from a small app to a larger business tool.

Motion’s product uses AI agents that can actually do work for users, not just give advice or suggestions. These agents are built into the platform, so they have full access to the data and can finish tasks by themselves. The company has grown very quickly, reaching a high amount of revenue in just three months, and they have support from big investors like YC and Sam Altman.

The new engineer will help with big changes, like making the app work offline, syncing data quickly, and breaking the app into smaller parts called micro frontends. They will also help make the app load much faster. The role involves making important decisions that will affect how the app works for a long time.

The company looks for ambitious people who want to improve and grow. They want engineers who can take charge of projects, work through problems that are not fully defined, and learn new things fast. It’s important to focus on what helps customers most, not only on technical challenges. Working at Motion means working with experienced coworkers and learning from them. The pay is high, with salaries up to $375,000 and total compensation almost $1 million, including bonuses and equity. The job is remote for people in North America and Canada, and visa sponsorship is available.

In the Hacker News comments, some people are surprised by the high salary and want to know more about the workload and work-life balance. Others question if the company’s “intense” work culture means long hours or high stress. A few commenters say that working on deep technical changes like micro frontends and offline sync is exciting and will attract top talent. Some people are interested in how the AI agents work differently from common copilots, and if this will change how businesses use software. Others wonder about the company’s future, and if the fast growth is sustainable. A few say that the job sounds great for people who want to learn quickly and work with strong teams, but not everyone will enjoy the high-pressure environment. Some mention that visa sponsorship is a big plus for people outside the U.S. There are mixed views on whether the company’s culture will help or hurt employee happiness over time. Many agree that Motion’s engineering problems are interesting, but note that the high standards are not for everyone.

## Secondary school maths showing that AI systems don't think

- 原文链接: [Secondary school maths showing that AI systems don't think](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/secondary-school-maths-showing-that-ai-systems-dont-think/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46245731)

This article is about using secondary school maths to show that AI systems do not actually “think” like humans do. It explains how normal maths lessons can help students understand what AI really is and clear up some common wrong ideas.

The researchers from Austria and Germany made workshops that use AI examples in maths classes. These workshops use real-world problems, like predicting traffic lights, Netflix recommendations, and weather forecasting, to teach maths topics such as decision trees, regression, and neural networks. For example, students learn to separate data about red and green traffic lights using lines, and then test if the model works well. They also discuss mistakes the model can make, like misreading a red light, and what this means for safety. Another lesson introduces a simple (toy) artificial neural network to show how it is just a set of maths functions, not a brain that “understands” or “sees.” Students use online tools to change the model and see how it fits data. They see that AI just finds patterns in data, and does not really learn or know, it only does calculations. The article says that adding these AI contexts makes maths more fun and useful, and helps students see that AI is not magic.

The teachers also get students to talk about the social and ethical problems of AI, like bias and privacy. The workshops use Jupyter notebooks, so students do not need to know how to code. The article’s author thinks this approach makes hard ideas much simpler for students, but says teachers will need to guide students step by step.

People in the Hacker News comments have a lot to say. Some agree, saying AI is just maths and statistics, and it is important for kids to learn this early so they are not fooled by hype. Others say that, even if AI is only maths, the results can still look very smart or even creative, which can be confusing. A few people say that teaching the limits of AI is good, but students should also learn about what AI can do well. Some worry that focusing only on maths might make students miss out on the bigger ideas, like how AI changes jobs and society. Others share tips about teaching AI, saying hands-on demos work best. Some raise the point that many adults also believe AI “thinks,” so it is good to teach these ideas at school. Finally, a few commenters argue that, while AI does not think, it can still do things that surprise us, so we should be careful not to make students think AI is useless or simple.

## String theory inspires a brilliant, baffling new math proof

- 原文链接: [String theory inspires a brilliant, baffling new math proof](https://www.quantamagazine.org/string-theory-inspires-a-brilliant-baffling-new-math-proof-20251212/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46245622)

A group of mathematicians say they have solved a big problem in algebraic geometry by using ideas from string theory, a part of physics. Their proof tries to show which kinds of polynomial equations can be “parameterized” (solved in a simple way), and which cannot.

Polynomials are equations like x² + y² = 1, and their solutions can make shapes such as lines, circles, or more complex objects. Some polynomials are easy to solve; you can write all solutions using simple formulas. Others are much harder and create rich geometric shapes. For decades, mathematicians have wanted to classify which polynomial equations are easy and which are hard in this way, but progress stopped after a certain point.

The new proof focuses on degree-3 polynomials with five variables, which were not fully understood. Earlier work had shown that for three variables, these equations are usually parameterizable (easy), but for four variables, most are not (hard). The question for five variables was open for a long time. The mathematicians used ideas from string theory, especially something called “mirror symmetry,” which links shapes studied in math to those in physics.

A famous mathematician, Maxim Kontsevich, had worked for years on these deep connections between math and physics. With help from others, especially Tony Yue Yu, and after a key formula was found by Hiroshi Iritani, the team broke the problem into smaller pieces called “atoms.” They proved that for the five-variable case, there is always at least one atom that cannot be made simple. This shows that these equations cannot be parameterized in an easy way.

Mathematicians are now trying to understand the proof, which uses very new and unfamiliar tools. Some trust Kontsevich because he is famous and has made big discoveries before. Others are cautious, saying the proof is hard to follow and relies on ideas from physics, not just math. Many reading groups around the world are studying the paper, but even after weeks, people still feel lost. Some compare this situation to a past famous proof that was also hard to understand at first. Some are excited and see it as a step toward new ways of doing math, while others want to see more traditional explanations before they are convinced. Overall, this proof has restarted interest in an old problem and made many people hopeful about future discoveries.
