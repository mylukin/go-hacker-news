Hello everyone, this is the 2025-12-30 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have a full lineup of tech stories that show how developers and teams are building, fixing, and experimenting with software, hardware, and even the environment. Let’s get started.

Our first story looks at how the company Kasava manages everything in a single monorepo. At Kasava, all of their code, documentation, website, marketing materials, emails, and even investor slides live together in one big code repository. This means there’s just one source of truth for the whole business. For example, if the pricing limit changes, you only update a JSON file once, and then the change appears everywhere: in the app, on the website, in the docs, and more. The company’s AI tools can read and update the repo, so if you ask the AI to change the pricing page, it will make sure the backend, frontend, docs, and even blog posts all match.

Kasava’s workflow is simple: make your changes, and ‘git push.’ There’s no need for separate tools for content or docs—everything is code and follows the same review and shipping process. This helps avoid confusion and broken links between teams. Each project has its own dependencies, making things easier to manage, and every main folder has a ‘CLAUDE.md’ file to explain what it is and how to get started, which helps both people and AI assistants. Their CI/CD setup only rebuilds what actually changes, and big files are stored outside the repo when needed.

There are some challenges. The repo is big but not too big—cloning is still fast. Each part builds on its own, so build times are not a problem. Everyone on the small team can see everything, but more controls can be added if the team grows. Switching between different code types can be hard, but using the same tools helps.

In the comments, many agree that a monorepo makes life easier for small teams, keeping everything connected and easy to update. Some say this works well until the company gets very big. Others like that everything, even docs and marketing, is code, making updates and reviews faster. A few warn that very large monorepos can get slow, and it might be hard to control access. Some people note that tools like Google Docs or WordPress are still useful for non-technical teams. Overall, most agree that this approach helps small, fast-moving teams ship updates quickly.

Next, we have a story about FediMeteo—a global weather service built on a tiny FreeBSD VPS for just four euros a month. The creator started FediMeteo to bring weather updates to local cities in the Fediverse, but it soon grew to serve thousands of users around the world. FreeBSD’s jails make it easy to separate countries and keep things secure. The service uses open weather sources like Open-Meteo and wttr.in, and is built from simple Unix tools and scripts that work together. For each city, there’s a “user” in the snac software posting updates. Every six hours, a Python script pulls weather data and posts it.

As the project grew, users asked for more features: more countries, languages, time zones, and measurement units. The creator had to handle cities with the same name, and he added caching to fix problems with city coordinates. The whole service now covers nearly 3,000 cities in 38 countries, all while using very little memory and CPU. He also learned some hard lessons, like leaking an API key by accident, but users helped him fix it quickly.

Hacker News readers love the Unix philosophy behind the project and praise the use of FreeBSD. Some wonder if the VPS can keep up with even more users, or if managing many jails will get tricky. People like the open data and text-based, JavaScript-free design. There’s praise for the developer’s openness, and some share stories about their own small tools growing fast. Others hope this approach can be used for other public data, not just weather.

Our next story is about F-Droid, the popular free Android app store, upgrading its main server. Thanks to community donations, F-Droid replaced 12-year-old hardware with a new, much faster server. The team took their time to find hardware that would last long and fit their needs. The server is managed by a trusted contributor, not a random data center, matching F-Droid’s focus on security and transparency.

With this upgrade, app updates go out every day or even twice a day, instead of every three or four days. Developers and users get new versions faster, and the project is safer and more reliable. Many in the community are happy and thank the F-Droid team. Some ask about the server hardware, and a few worry about having only one server in one place, suggesting cloud hosting for backup. Others say F-Droid’s careful, independent setup is why they trust it. There are also calls for even more transparency, maybe with open hardware in the future. Overall, the response is very positive.

Now, let’s talk about “Hacker Book,” a project that lets you download all of Hacker News—about 22 GB—in one SQLite file. This giant dataset includes all posts, comments, and user profiles since 2006, with over 46 million items. The data is divided into many parts for easier use, and the site also works as a fast, alternative Hacker News frontend. You can search by user, category, or time, sort by comments or points, and even see deleted stories and comments.

People are excited about what they can do with this data: track trends, analyze topic popularity, follow famous users, or build new frontends. Some mention privacy concerns, but most agree this is public info. There are tips on handling such a big SQLite file, and some worry about the 22 GB size. The creator promises regular updates. People debate if this will help spot trends or fight spam, and many are excited to use it for research, machine learning, or just exploring tech history.

Another story today is about a new way to clean up dangerous chemicals like DDT and lindane from soil using electrolysis. A team at ETH Zurich uses electricity to break these chemicals into safe parts, turning them into table salt and useful industry materials. The process uses alternating current, which is cheap and avoids making dangerous chlorine gas. The equipment is simple and mobile, so there’s no need to move polluted soil. This not only cleans the soil but also recycles chemical pieces for industry. Tests show it works for mixed or dirty soil. The team hopes this will help the environment and support a circular economy.

Readers are excited, hoping this can finally solve old chemical pollution. Some want to know if the method is safe and works on a large scale. There are questions about cost, what happens to recycled materials, and if the process can clean up other chemicals. Some share memories of DDT’s harm in the past. Others like that the equipment is mobile for remote locations, and many think governments should support this research.

Switching to security, Libsodium, a well-known cryptography library, just fixed a bug in its function for checking Edwards25519 curve points. The bug meant some invalid points were accepted because a second check was missing. This only affects people using the low-level API directly. High-level functions and keypairs are not at risk. The fix was simple—add a check for Y equals Z. If you can't update, the article gives a workaround. The author suggests using Ristretto255 for even more safety.

In the comments, people thank the author for being open and quick to fix the bug. Most agree it’s a rare edge case. Some say this shows why you shouldn’t use low-level crypto functions unless you really know what you’re doing. There’s praise for Ristretto255, and talk about how hard it is to keep crypto libraries bug-free. Some are surprised this is Libsodium’s first CVE, and there are calls for more funding to support the maintainer.

Next up, zpdf is a new open-source library written in Zig for extracting text from PDFs. It’s much faster than MuPDF, a popular tool. zpdf uses memory-mapped files to handle large PDFs and supports many compression types and font encodings. It uses SIMD for fast string searching and can extract text from many pages at once using all CPU cores. In tests, zpdf is 3 to 5 times faster than MuPDF for single-thread jobs, and up to 18 times faster using all cores. The library is open source under the MIT license.

Commenters are excited to see a Zig project beating MuPDF. People like the use of memory-mapped files and SIMD. Some ask if zpdf handles tricky or encrypted PDFs, and if it works with Asian fonts or right-to-left languages. There’s talk about real-world accuracy, since many PDFs have odd layouts. Some want to use zpdf as a drop-in replacement for MuPDF or PDFMiner. Others say Zig programs are small and easy to deploy. People are interested but want to see more real-world tests.

Now, let’s talk about Toro, an open-source unikernel for running applications as small virtual machines, or microVMs. Toro is built for speed and small size, using modern Linux virtualization tools like QEMU-KVM and Firecracker. It supports up to 512GB of RAM and uses a cooperative scheduler. Toro uses virtio for networking and files, and comes with examples like a static web server. You can try it with Docker or build it yourself. It’s written mostly in Pascal, with some Assembly and Python, and uses the GPLv3 license.

In the comments, some are excited about unikernels and Toro’s use of modern tools. Others point out that unikernels can be hard to debug and often lack hardware support, but they like Toro’s built-in gdbstub. Some wish Toro supported ARM, not just x86-64. There are questions about real-world use, and some think unikernels are best for special cases like serverless or edge computing. People are happy Toro is open source and easy to try.

Next, we have a look at how professional developers are using AI agents to write code in 2025. A study with 112 experienced developers found that AI agents help do tasks faster and can handle many jobs at once. Some let the AI write whole code parts from natural language instructions, but most developers keep control, reviewing and correcting the AI’s work. Software quality—safety, correctness, maintainability—remains key, so developers use their own skills to check the AI’s output.

Developers like using AI for simple or repetitive tasks and brainstorming, but want to keep control for complex or important work. Most see AI as a helper, not a replacement. In the comments, people agree that humans should stay in charge. Some worry new developers may miss out on basic skills, and others want better tools to watch and guide AI agents. There’s hope that AI will free up time for more creative work, but caution about companies pushing AI for speed, even if quality drops. Most agree: AI is useful, but humans must still lead.

Our last story is about “loss32,” a project that wants to make a Linux desktop where everything runs Win32 software through WINE. The idea is to let users download and run Windows .exe files easily on Linux, giving a Windows-like desktop but with Linux’s stable kernel and hardware support. Unlike ReactOS, which copies the Windows NT kernel, loss32 uses Linux, WINE, and some ReactOS user parts. This could mean better hardware support and stability, and you can still run Linux apps when needed.

The project is still early and rough, but there’s a real screenshot showing it works. The team is looking for help, especially from people with WINE or Linux desktop experience. An early version should be ready in January 2026.

In the comments, some are excited, saying this could make WINE better for everyone. Some worry about problems with software updates and security when relying on Win32. Others compare loss32 to ReactOS and hope the Linux base avoids past problems. There are questions about mixing Windows and Linux apps, and if this will cause confusion. Some are skeptical, thinking WINE is still not perfect, but others see it as a fun experiment or niche tool for people who need old Windows programs.

That’s all for today’s Hacker News Daily Podcast. Thank you for listening, and we’ll see you next time with more stories from the tech world.
