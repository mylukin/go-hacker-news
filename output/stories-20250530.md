- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44139454)

Stanford's post talks about AI-generated kernels that are unexpectedly fast, even beating expert-optimized ones in PyTorch. They focused on creating synthetic data to train better models, but found the data itself led to very efficient kernels. Some examples include a Conv2D kernel performing at 179.9% of PyTorch's speed and a LayerNorm at 484.4%.

They use a benchmark called KernelBench. The idea is to replace PyTorch operations with custom kernels, hoping for a speed boost. They check correctness by comparing outputs with PyTorch. The usual way to improve kernel speed is by making small changes repeatedly. But this can get stuck in a loop of similar ideas.

To solve this, they tried two new things: first, making the AI think in natural language about new ideas, and second, trying many ideas at once. This lets them explore more options and find better solutions. They noticed that many successful kernels used similar strategies, like optimizing memory access or using lower precision data types.

In the comments, one user humorously suggests that some might underestimate AI by saying it's just repeating patterns, like a "stochastic parrot." This highlights a common debate about AI's ability to innovate.
