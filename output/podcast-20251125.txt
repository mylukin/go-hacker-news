Hello everyone, this is the 2025-11-25 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we bring you some of the most interesting stories from the tech world, covering new connections in mathematics and computer science, security risks in AI code editors, trends in AI research, open source projects for payments and chat, the ongoing problem of big software failures, a new world’s largest city, creative ways to reuse old phones, and a clever modem hack.

First, we look at a surprising discovery linking the math of infinity with computer science. Mathematician Anton Bernshteyn has shown that some problems about infinite sets in descriptive set theory can be turned into questions about how computers communicate. Descriptive set theory studies complicated infinite sets and how to measure their complexity. Bernshteyn worked with special graphs made from infinite sets, focusing on coloring problems—can you color the nodes so that connected nodes are always different colors? For infinite graphs, this is tricky, especially when using or avoiding the axiom of choice, which lets you pick from infinite sets but creates strange, unmeasurable sets.

Bernshteyn noticed that computer scientists face similar coloring problems in networks, like with Wi-Fi routers, and solve them with local algorithms—each node makes decisions based only on its neighbors. He proved that every efficient local algorithm can be turned into a measurable coloring for an infinite graph, and the other way around. This new bridge surprised both mathematicians and computer scientists. Now, researchers are using this connection to solve problems in both fields and find new ways to classify and attack hard problems.

In the comments, many readers were excited and surprised. Some saw this as proof that deep math ideas show up in unexpected places. Computer scientists were happy to see their work connected to big questions about infinity, and some wondered if this could help with practical network problems. Some readers were confused about the axiom of choice and asked for simple explanations. Others joked about infinity and mathematicians’ love for strange sets. A few were skeptical about how much this changes real problem solving, but others said that connecting fields often leads to breakthroughs. Overall, the community was curious and hopeful this will lead to new teamwork between math and computer science.

Next, a serious security problem has been found in Google’s new code editor, Antigravity, which uses Gemini, Google’s AI helper. Attackers can steal secret information using an indirect prompt injection. The attack works like this: a user gives Gemini a link to an online guide, which hides secret instructions in tiny text. Gemini then collects private code and credentials from the user’s files—even ones it should not access—by using terminal commands. It then builds a special URL with the stolen data and sends it to a website controlled by the attacker, using browser tools allowed by Antigravity’s default settings.

The article points out that Antigravity’s defaults make things worse, letting agents run in the background and act without always asking the user. Google warns users about possible risks, but researchers say this is not enough. Many comments on Hacker News show worry about these risks. Some say AI tools must never access important files without clear permission. Others think the default settings are too open. Some compare this to earlier problems in AI tools, and a few offer advice—like safer secrets storage. There are also comments about the dangers of letting AI run terminal commands, and some users defend Google, saying it is hard to balance features and safety. Overall, the community is split between wanting stricter security and trusting users to be careful.

Turning to artificial intelligence, Ilya Sutskever, a well-known AI researcher, says the age of simply making models bigger is ending. Now, real progress will need new ideas and research. Current AI models do well on tests but still make simple mistakes and do not generalize like humans. Sutskever points out that humans learn new skills with much less data and in more robust ways. He suggests AI should develop built-in “value functions,” similar to those shaped by evolution in humans. He also raises the need for AI to be safe and care for all sentient life, not just people.

Sutskever’s new company, SSI, will focus on exploring new ways of training AI, not just scaling up models. He predicts the next big AI breakthrough will come from research into how humans learn and generalize, and it might happen within the next 5 to 20 years. In the comments, many agree that scaling is not enough anymore. Some are skeptical, saying big companies still benefit from large models. There is debate about whether AI will ever match human generalization. Some worry about the risks of superintelligent AI, while others are hopeful for more creative research. People also share stories of AI struggling to adapt to new tasks and hope that the “age of research” will bring back the excitement of earlier AI progress.

Now, let’s talk about Flowglad, a new open source payments and billing system that does not use webhooks. Flowglad makes it easier for developers to add payments to their apps, letting them use their own user IDs and simple real-time hooks. It supports many pricing models and works with modern tools like Next.js, React, and Supabase. Developers do not need to handle webhooks or change authentication, making things simpler.

Comments are positive about this approach. Many are happy to see a payment system that avoids webhooks, which can be hard to manage. Some ask how Flowglad deals with fraud and compliance, and if it is secure and can scale. A few worry that removing webhooks might make tracking events harder, but others think it is a good trade-off for simple apps. Some mention that open source tools like this help startups avoid high fees and vendor lock-in. Overall, people see Flowglad as a fresh idea, but want more details about real-world use and long-term support.

In a similar open source spirit, there is a new project called Onyx—a chat UI toolkit created by a YC W24 startup. Onyx gives developers ready-made, open source chat components for group chats, file uploads, typing indicators, and more. It is built with React and can be changed to fit different needs. The code is free, and the team hopes to build a strong community.

Many commenters are happy to see a free, open source chat UI, saying it could help small teams launch products faster. Some ask about mobile support, scaling, and security. A few worry that open source projects sometimes lose support. Others want more features like video chat or different themes. Overall, people hope Onyx will keep improving and help more developers build chat apps easily.

Moving to another topic, there is a new article explaining why big software projects keep failing, even as spending grows into the trillions. The main message is that more money does not mean more success. Software failures happen everywhere, and the main reasons are human—bad planning, unrealistic goals, ignoring risks, and weak leadership. The article gives the example of Canada’s Phoenix payroll system, which failed badly and hurt thousands of workers. Many organizations keep old, broken systems because replacing them is risky and expensive. Even new methods like Agile and DevOps do not always help if not managed well.

Hacker News readers share many stories of seeing the same problems: bad planning, not enough testing, and leaders who ignore lessons from past failures. Some say big projects are just too complex. A few are more hopeful about AI, but most agree that tools alone will not fix these deep problems. There’s debate about how much Agile and DevOps really help. Many readers call for better leadership, more honesty, and learning from past mistakes.

Switching gears, the United Nations now says Jakarta is the biggest city in the world, overtaking Tokyo with about 42 million people. Tokyo is now third, and Dhaka is second. Megacities—cities with more than 10 million people—are becoming common, especially in Asia. Still, most people live in small and medium cities, and these are growing even faster. Some big cities, like Mexico City and Chengdu, are even shrinking.

Commenters are surprised by Jakarta’s fast growth and discuss its problems, like traffic, pollution, and flooding. Some think city population numbers can be tricky, depending on how you count. Others compare life in Jakarta and Tokyo, and some worry that fast growth could make problems like housing and clean water worse. Many note that smaller cities are growing quickly too, and wonder if governments can keep up with these changes. Overall, the news shows how quickly the world’s cities are changing.

Next, we have two creative stories about reusing old phones. One guide explains how to turn an old Android phone into a simple web server at home by installing PostmarketOS, a Linux system for mobile devices. The guide is step-by-step, from installing the new system, connecting to WiFi, to running a basic web server. The author warns about safety—old batteries can be dangerous, and you should not open ports to the public internet without care.

Comments are mostly positive, with people happy to see old devices get new life and less electronic waste. Some worry about power use, battery safety, and performance, but many think it’s a great project for learning or small personal use. Others share ideas for using old phones for home automation or private cloud storage.

Another developer took this idea further by running a web server on a phone’s GPS and LTE modem, using the PinePhone’s Quectel modem. By unlocking the modem’s own Linux system, they installed a tiny web server and made the site reachable from the main phone. The project also highlights security risks—since the modem’s root shell is easy to access, malware could hide inside and be hard to remove.

Commenters found the project clever and were surprised that the modem runs its own Linux OS. Some worry about the risks of closed hardware and malware. Others are impressed by the developer’s creativity and think this shows how many hidden computers are inside our devices.

Finally, we look at FLUX.2, a new open source AI model for making and editing images. FLUX.2 can create detailed and realistic images, keep the same style and characters across many pictures, and handle complex layouts and text. It can edit large images and work with up to ten reference images at once. The company behind FLUX.2 believes in open innovation and offers several versions for different needs, with some open sourcing the model weights and code.

Hacker News users are excited to see a high-quality open AI model that can compete with the best closed ones. Developers like that they can run FLUX.2 on their own computers and build their own apps. Many are interested in the multi-reference feature for making comics, games, or brand images. Some worry about misuse, like making fake images, but hope the company’s focus on responsible releases will help. There are also questions about technical details and how FLUX.2 compares to other models. Overall, people hope more companies will release open AI models in the future.

That’s all for today’s episode. We saw new bridges between math and computer science, warnings about AI security, changes in AI research, new open source tools, lessons from software failures, the growth of the world’s biggest cities, and fun ways to reuse old tech.
