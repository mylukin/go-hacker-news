## How we lost communication to entertainment

- 原文链接: [How we lost communication to entertainment](https://ploum.net/2025-12-15-communication-entertainment.html)

This article talks about how online communication has changed into something more like entertainment. The writer explains that tools like ActivityPub and Fediverse platforms (such as Mastodon and Pixelfed) are less about real conversations and more about sharing and viewing content. The main argument is that these networks, which were once seen as ways to connect people (like email), are now just new forms of media, where missing a message is normal and expected.

The writer gives the example of Pixelfed, which sometimes drops messages without telling the user. This is a big problem for people who want reliable communication, but it does not bother people who use these networks only for entertainment. The article says that many younger users are used to having many accounts on different platforms, and do not care much if messages are lost. For them, these platforms are like TV—something to watch, not a place to talk.

The article points out that old internet users (often over 40) prefer email, RSS, or classic websites, where messages are not lost. They see ActivityPub as a way to talk, so dropped messages are bad. But many new users see ActivityPub and similar tools as ways to get content, not to communicate directly. The author says that even social networks pretend to be about communication, but they are really about keeping users busy and entertained, so companies can make money.

The article also talks about how email is now seen as old and boring, and many people just use it as another feed to scroll through. Reliable, simple communication tools like email, IRC, or XMPP are not popular because they are not addictive or exciting. The author says this is why entertainment-focused platforms win: they are designed to keep users hooked, while real communication tools are ignored.

The article ends by saying that true communication online is disappearing, but some people still use email, mailing lists, and RSS. The writer says it is okay to be part of a small group that values simple, direct communication.

In the comment section, some people agree with the writer and miss the older days of email and forums. They say that today’s platforms make it hard to have deep conversations, and that losing messages is a big problem. Others argue that content-focused platforms are not all bad—sometimes people just want to read or watch things, not always talk.

A few commenters say that multiple accounts are not really a problem, and that having different accounts for different purposes can give users more freedom. Some point out that email is not perfect either: it gets a lot of spam and is often ignored. Others say that most people do not care about lost messages because they never expect a reply anyway.

One commenter explains that modern social networks are more like TV or radio, where you just consume what is given to you. Another person says that the rise of instant messaging is because people want fast answers, not slow, careful replies. Some agree that these new tools do not help people truly connect, but also admit they are easier and more fun to use.

A few people say that reliable communication is still possible, but it is now hidden behind boring or old technology. Some wish for better tools that mix fun and reliable messaging. Others think the change is just part of how technology moves forward. Finally, some thank the writer for reminding them that simple communication is still possible, even if it is not popular.

## Floor796

- 原文链接: [Floor796](https://floor796.com/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46401612)

Floor796 is an interactive website that shows a huge animated floor filled with many funny and detailed scenes. The idea comes from the famous movie "Akira" and other anime, where there are big buildings with many different rooms. The website lets you explore these rooms on a single, very wide floor, and each room has its own little story or joke.

You can scroll left and right to see hundreds of different rooms. Each room has moving people, robots, pets, or objects. Some rooms have references to video games, anime, and internet culture. You might see Mario, Pikachu, or a robot cleaning. There are hidden jokes and small animations everywhere. If you click on some rooms, you can trigger little surprises or extra animations. The art style is bright and pixelated, like an old video game.

The project is made by a small team from Russia. They add new rooms and scenes from time to time. The website runs smoothly on most computers, but it can use a lot of memory if you scroll for a long time. It is made with HTML5 and JavaScript, and the source code is not open. The creators also sell prints and posters of the artwork.

In the comments, many people say they love the creativity and detail of Floor796. Some users notice funny references to their favorite games and shows. Others talk about how the site feels like a modern "Where's Waldo?" with so many things to find. A few users wish there was a search or map feature, to make it easier to find rooms. Some worry that the site can be slow on old computers or phones. Others ask if the creators plan to open-source the project or add more interactive features. A few people share links to similar projects or pixel art communities. Most agree that Floor796 is a joyful and unique website that is fun to explore, but some think it could be even better with more ways to interact or navigate.

## Windows 2 for the Apricot PC/Xi

- 原文链接: [Windows 2 for the Apricot PC/Xi](https://www.ninakalinina.com/notes/win2apri/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46403915)

This article is about someone getting Windows 2, Word, and Excel running on an old Apricot PC/Xi, a computer from the 1980s that is not IBM PC-compatible. The author wanted to use this rare computer for word processing and spreadsheets, so they started the hard task of porting Windows 2 to it.

The Apricot PC/Xi is a British computer with an Intel 8086 chip, using 3.5" floppy disks before even the Macintosh did. It has a sharp monochrome screen and a small, simple design, but it cannot run normal IBM PC software. Because of this, it never became popular, and only a few programs exist for it.

The author explains that Windows 1 was already ported to the Apricot in the 1980s, but its software support was poor. Windows 2 is much more useful, but porting it was difficult. The main problem was that the Apricot drivers for Windows 1 were only available as part of a special combined boot file, not as separate driver files needed for Windows 2.

To solve this, the author tried making their own simple ("stub") drivers using Microsoft’s Driver Development Kit. This allowed Windows 2 to start, but it couldn’t show graphics properly because the Apricot’s video system was very different. Writing a new video driver for the Apricot was too hard, so the author looked for another way.

They found that if they could get the video driver and font from the old Windows 1 boot file and patch it into a Windows 2 driver, it might work. They wrote a tool to help extract and combine the needed parts, fixing headers and offsets by hand. This finally got Windows 2 running with working graphics on the Apricot.

The author also had trouble with the mouse driver and system timer, but after more debugging and writing a new system driver, everything worked. Now, the Apricot can run Windows 2, along with Word, Excel, and some games.

The article includes a tour of the system, with screenshots of programs and details about the Apricot’s hardware. The author is happy to have modern-ish software on such an old and rare computer, and thanks their fiancée and other experts who helped.

In the Hacker News comments, many people praise the author’s dedication and technical skill. Some are surprised that anyone would spend so much effort on such an obscure computer, but they admire the passion for old hardware. Others share their own stories about rare computers or early Windows versions, and a few discuss the technical challenges of writing drivers for non-standard machines.

Some commenters focus on the history of the Apricot PC, noting its advanced features for the time, like the early use of 3.5" disks. Others point out that lack of IBM PC compatibility doomed many good computers in the 1980s. A few debate whether projects like this are useful or just “tech archaeology,” but most agree it’s impressive.

People are also curious about the tools the author wrote, especially the driver extraction tool, and ask if it could help with other old computers. Some wish there were more games or new software for these rare systems.

Overall, the comments show great respect for the effort and skill needed to bring new life to an almost forgotten computer. Many say the story is inspiring or makes them want to try similar projects themselves.

## Nvidia's $20B antitrust loophole

- 原文链接: [Nvidia's $20B antitrust loophole](https://ossa-ma.github.io/blog/groq)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46403559)

Nvidia paid $20 billion for Groq’s technology and team, but did not buy the whole company. They used a special deal structure to avoid antitrust rules and other legal problems.

Nvidia got all of Groq's intellectual property, patents, and top leaders, but left GroqCloud—the cloud business—out of the deal. Groq’s special chip, the LPU, is different from Nvidia’s and Google’s chips. Instead of using regular memory (DRAM), LPUs use fast on-chip SRAM. This makes Groq’s chips very good for running AI models quickly and efficiently, but they cannot train large models and have size limits.

Nvidia paid three times Groq’s recent valuation, using a licensing deal instead of a normal buyout. This helped Nvidia skip government reviews and shareholder votes. The deal also allowed Nvidia to avoid Groq’s business in Saudi Arabia, which could have caused trouble with U.S. regulators. By moving fast, Nvidia blocked other big tech companies from getting Groq’s technology or team.

Most of the deal money will go to Groq’s investors and top executives. Regular employees might get less, depending on how the money is split. People left at GroqCloud are unlikely to benefit, since the company lost its key technology and leaders.

Many comments on Hacker News say this was a smart legal move by Nvidia. Some users think it is unfair and shows how big companies work around laws. Others point out how investors and leaders win big, while regular workers get little or nothing. A few worry that this kind of deal could hurt innovation and make it harder for new companies to compete. Some users are excited by Groq’s chip design and hope Nvidia will use it well. Others discuss possible problems for customers using GroqCloud now that the main team is gone. There is debate about whether regulators will change rules to stop these kinds of deals in the future. A few commenters also mention the political links between Groq, its investors, and U.S. policy makers, suggesting these connections helped make the deal possible. Some users think Nvidia paid too much, but most agree it wanted to protect its lead in AI hardware.

## Janet Jackson had the power to crash laptop computers (2022)

- 原文链接: [Janet Jackson had the power to crash laptop computers (2022)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20220816-00/?p=106994)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46403291)

Janet Jackson’s song “Rhythm Nation” once caused some laptop computers to crash just by playing its music video. The problem was found in laptops with certain 5400 rpm hard drives, and even nearby laptops could crash if the song played close to them. The cause was that the song had a sound at the natural resonant frequency of those hard drives, making the drives vibrate and fail. The fix was to add an audio filter to remove the dangerous frequency before playing the song. The story also links to the famous Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse, which many people remember as a resonance disaster, and mentions that the real cause was a bit more complex.

In the comments, some people say this type of problem still happens today in storage servers, often because of fan noise or other vibrations. Others joke about using the song to crash machines or wonder if the story is an urban legend. Several users discuss the physics behind resonance, explaining that it depends on the shape, material, and support of the object, not just its spin speed. There are debates about whether better vibration damping in laptops could have prevented the problem, with some saying that cheap laptops skip this to save money. One commenter notes that the story was real, as told by someone on the Microsoft team. Another person points out that this event even got its own security CVE, though some think that’s a joke. There’s also a link to a similar story about chickens and factory noise, and a few people share how this incident made news in other places. Some commenters ask for more technical details, while others are just amazed that a pop song could crash a computer.

## Clock synchronization is a nightmare

- 原文链接: [Clock synchronization is a nightmare](https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/clock-sync-nightmare/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46368177)

This article explains why keeping clocks in sync across many computers is very hard. When computers are spread out in different places, there is no shared global clock, and each machine’s time can drift apart from others.

The main problem is that each computer has its own clock, usually based on a quartz crystal, but these crystals are not perfect. Changes in temperature, small differences from the factory, and aging all make clocks run a bit faster or slower. Over time, this means two machines will have different times, even if they started together.

This drift causes trouble. For example, if you edit a file on your computer and the server’s clock is ahead, the server might think your file is older and ignore your changes. In databases, if two actions happen at nearly the same time on different machines, the database might put them in the wrong order, which can be a big problem for things like bank transactions. Debugging and logging also get confusing if clocks don’t agree, making it hard to see what happened first.

To fix this, there are several ways to sync clocks. The Cristian algorithm asks a central server for the time, but network delays make it hard to be exact. The Berkeley algorithm collects times from all computers and averages them, adjusting clocks slowly so they never go backwards, which could confuse software. The most common system is NTP, which uses layers of servers to spread time from very accurate sources, like atomic clocks or GPS. But NTP is still only accurate to a few milliseconds, and delays in the network and operating system can make it less precise.

Some jobs need even better accuracy. For example, financial trading and science experiments may need times to match within microseconds or even nanoseconds. PTP is a protocol that uses special hardware to get very close sync, but it costs more to set up.

Sometimes, instead of trying to match real-world time, computers use logical clocks. Lamport timestamps are simple counters that help order events, but they can’t always tell if two things happened at the same time or in which order. Vector clocks are more detailed and can show if events are concurrent or ordered, but they take more space since they store one number for each computer in the system.

Google’s Spanner database uses a system called TrueTime, which combines GPS and atomic clocks, and returns a time interval instead of a single number. This way, it can make sure events are ordered correctly, though it sometimes has to wait a few milliseconds to be sure. CockroachDB uses hybrid logical clocks, which mix real time and logical counters, to get most of the benefits without expensive hardware.

The article ends by saying there is no perfect solution—what you choose depends on how much accuracy you need and how much complexity and cost you can handle. Sometimes, you just need NTP. Other times, you need logical clocks or expensive hardware. But you must always plan for small errors, because perfect clock sync is impossible.

Hacker News readers shared many ideas and stories. Some said they learned the hard way how even a small clock drift can break things, especially with file syncing or distributed builds. Others pointed out that leap seconds, when an extra second is added to the clock, can crash systems that are not ready for it. A few people shared how their companies use PTP or GPS for very precise needs, like stock trading, and how expensive or tricky it is to keep everything working.

Some comments discussed logical clocks and how they are easier to use in some systems. Others warned that even with good network protocols like NTP, you can never fully trust the network, especially over the internet. A few readers liked Google’s TrueTime approach but noted it only works if you can afford special hardware everywhere.

There were also tips on how to make software safer, like always checking if the clock jumps backwards and using monotonic clocks when possible. Some people said that for most apps, you don’t need microsecond accuracy, and worrying too much about perfect sync just adds complexity. Others argued it’s important to understand these problems, even if you rely on libraries or cloud services to handle time.

Finally, many agreed that clock sync is a deep, tricky topic and that every engineer working on distributed systems should learn more about it, because time bugs can be very hard to find and fix.

## White House pushes to dismantle leading climate and weather research center

- 原文链接: [White House pushes to dismantle leading climate and weather research center](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/white-house-pushes-to-dismantle-leading-climate-and-weather-research-center)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46405183)

The White House plans to close the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Colorado, the top weather and climate research center in the U.S. The center has helped scientists all over the world study weather, climate, and how these affect daily life and safety. Experts say NCAR is important because it has special tools, supercomputers, and smart people working together to make weather forecasts better and safer. For example, NCAR helped invent technology to warn planes about dangerous winds and tools to measure hurricane strength. The center’s work helps predict storms, protect people, and study how the climate is changing over time.

The Trump administration says NCAR spreads "climate alarmism" and wants to move its work elsewhere. Scientists worry this will hurt progress and make it harder to train new experts. They say that NCAR’s climate research is key now, because the world faces more extreme weather and climate disasters. Both a climate scientist and a meteorologist in the article agree that NCAR’s science is not political or “woke”—it just gives facts to help everyone. They fear that closing NCAR is part of a bigger trend to ignore important science.

If the center closes, many people could lose access to useful weather and climate information. It would also be hard to rebuild such a center in the future. The administration says the research can be done somewhere else, but experts are not sure this will work well. They point out that weather and climate affect everyone, and that even people in states that often support the administration could be at risk from storms or disasters if weather science is weaker.

In the Hacker News comments, there is a lot of worry and debate. Some people are shocked, saying weather and climate science are vital for public safety and should not be political. Others think the government spends too much money and that private companies could do this research instead, but many reply that NCAR’s data is open to all and helps everyone, not just paying customers. Some users say the move is short-sighted and will make the U.S. less safe in the long run. Others note that science often gets attacked when it gives results that leaders do not want to hear. A few suggest that breaking up NCAR might create gaps in knowledge and teamwork that cannot be fixed easily. There are also comments about how this action could hurt America’s leadership in weather and climate tools, and some fear it will make future disasters harder to predict or handle.

## Gpg.fail

- 原文链接: [Gpg.fail](https://gpg.fail)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46403200)

This article talks about many new security problems found in GnuPG, which is a popular tool for PGP encryption and signing. The person who found these issues is sharing details, proof-of-concepts, and patches to help fix them.

The main problems are serious. One issue allows attackers to change signed messages or make fake signatures by using tricks with the filename field or the way GnuPG checks signatures. Some attacks can recover the original message, even when it is encrypted. Others let attackers add extra subkeys, inject trusted comments, or confuse users with strange message formats.

There is also a problem where GnuPG does not clearly show if a signature check passed or failed, which can make users trust a message that is not safe. Some bugs let attackers use old, broken hash functions like SHA1, or trick the program with special characters and line formats. There are even memory corruption bugs which could crash the program or let attackers run their own code.

The person who found these bugs says they had to rebuild the website quickly, but will add more details soon. They also promise to release slides, code, and patches to help users and developers understand and fix the problems.

People in the comment section have strong opinions. Some are shocked that GnuPG, a tool trusted for years, has so many problems. They worry about projects and companies that use GPG for important things like software updates and email security. Others point out that cryptography is hard to get right, and even old, trusted code can have hidden bugs.

A few users say that these findings show why it is important to keep security software simple and easy to review. Some think the issues are not all equally dangerous, but agree that users should update GnuPG and watch for fixes. Others share tips on how to protect themselves, like checking signatures carefully and not trusting email attachments by default.

Some developers talk about other tools they use instead of GnuPG, saying there might be safer choices. A few people thank the researcher for sharing their work openly, helping the whole community. There is also debate about how quickly the GnuPG team will fix these issues, and if the open-source model helps or hurts security in this case. Many agree that trust in digital signatures is important, and everyone should pay attention to updates about these problems.

## Show HN: Ez FFmpeg – Video editing in plain English

- 原文链接: [Show HN: Ez FFmpeg – Video editing in plain English](http://npmjs.com/package/ezff)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46400251)

Ez FFmpeg is a new tool that lets you do video editing using plain English commands. The idea is to make FFmpeg—normally a very technical tool—much easier for everyone to use.

The tool works by letting you type what you want, like "cut the video from 10s to 30s" or "add music to the background," and then it turns your words into FFmpeg commands. You don’t need to know any code or special syntax. This is good for people who find FFmpeg too hard or confusing. The package is shared on npm, so you can install it with Node.js. It likely supports many simple tasks like trimming, joining, resizing, and changing video speed. Because it uses FFmpeg under the hood, it should be powerful and fast. The main goal is to save time and help people who want to edit videos without learning all the FFmpeg tricks.

In the comments, some people are excited about the idea. They say FFmpeg is strong, but often too hard for beginners. They like that this tool could open up video editing to more people. Others wonder how well the plain English feature works. They ask if it can handle hard or strange requests, or if you need to write your sentences in a certain way. A few users worry about errors—if the tool misunderstands your words, it might do the wrong thing. There’s also talk about security, since running commands from text can be risky. Some developers hope the project stays simple and doesn’t try to do too much. Overall, many agree this tool could help a lot of people, but they want to see more examples and maybe a demo before they trust it for real projects.

## They made me an offer I couldn't refuse (1997)

- 原文链接: [They made me an offer I couldn't refuse (1997)](https://jens.mooseyard.com/1997/04/13/they-made-me-an-offer-i-couldnt-refuse/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46370309)

This article tells the story of a software developer who made a note-taking program called “Antler Notes” while working at Apple in the 1990s. Apple wanted to buy this program, but then upper management realized they might already own it since the developer was an employee.

At first, it looked like Apple would get the program for free, which made the developer feel frustrated and powerless. In the end, some people at the company arranged for him to get a bonus, but it wasn’t officially tied to the program. The writer says this experience helped him understand the idea of “alienation from one’s labor,” where workers lose control over what they create.

The article explains that, by law, companies own anything employees make that relates to their business, even if the work happens at home on personal time and equipment. This is usually written in the contracts people sign when they start a tech job. In California, there’s a law (Section 2870) that says if you make something entirely on your own time and without company resources, the company doesn’t own it—unless it’s related to the company’s business or your job.

The writer points out that it’s often hard to know what “related to the company’s business” really means. Many people think that if you work for a company making software for a certain platform, anything you make for that platform could be claimed by the company.

He gives advice for keeping your side projects safe: talk to the company’s legal team before you start, and get their agreement in writing. When you start a job and sign paperwork, list all your old projects and even ideas you might want to work on later. One friend even listed vague ideas with code names to cover future projects, though the writer isn’t sure if this is a good idea.

In the Hacker News comments, many people share similar stories about companies claiming ownership over side projects. Some think companies act unfairly, while others say the law is clear and employees should be careful. A few people talk about how hard it is to prove you made something completely outside of your job. Some recommend always getting legal advice or even avoiding side projects while working for big tech companies. Other commenters say it’s best to work for companies that respect your outside work and trust their employees. A few mention that these rules can be different in other countries, and not everyone agrees on what’s fair. Overall, people agree this is a tough problem for developers who want to build things outside of work.
