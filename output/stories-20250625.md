## QEMU: Define policy forbidding use of AI code generators

- 原文链接: [QEMU: Define policy forbidding use of AI code generators](https://github.com/qemu/qemu/commit/3d40db0efc22520fa6c399cf73960dced423b048)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44382752)

QEMU, a big open-source project, just made a rule: you cannot use AI code generators (like ChatGPT or Copilot) to make code for their project. The main reason is legal risk—no one is sure who owns AI-generated code or if it copies from somewhere else.

The article explains two main legal worries: First, if AI code is found to break copyright, it could be very hard to remove and fix, because you can’t always tell what came from AI and what was changed by humans. Second, if AI code is called public domain, open-source licenses might not fully protect the project anymore. This could make it easier for others to use or abuse the code without following QEMU’s license rules. The rule is strict: no AI-generated code at all, not even if you edit or change it later. The QEMU team says this is the safest choice right now, but they might change the rule in the future. They want to protect the project from legal problems and avoid spending time on court cases. Another worry is that AI code might look good but be wrong or unsafe, especially for complex projects like QEMU that need deep understanding of hardware. The team also wants every contributor to really understand the code they send in, not just copy and paste from an AI tool.

People in the comments had many views. Some agree with QEMU, saying it’s smart to avoid legal trouble until the law is clearer. Others think the rule is too strict and hard to enforce, because many code editors now have AI help built in. Some worry that banning AI will slow QEMU down, and projects that use AI might move faster and win. But others reply that there is not much proof yet that AI-written code is better or that human-only projects are losing. Many developers say they use AI for small things, like autocomplete or quick scripts, but always check and rewrite the code themselves. A few point out that reviewing AI code is hard, because sometimes it looks right but has hidden bugs, and it wastes expert time. Some think the main problem is not legal, but that too much low-quality AI code (called “slop”) makes open-source maintainers’ lives harder. There are also worries about people using AI to fake skills and spam projects with bad code to pad their resumes. A few people wonder if this is like “cheating if you get caught,” since it’s so hard to tell what code is from AI. Others say it’s important to set the rule anyway, to make clear what the project expects. Some see this as just a temporary measure until laws or tools improve, while others worry it could hurt open source in the long run. Overall, most agree the question is hard, and the best answer may change as AI and laws keep growing.

## A new pyramid-like shape always lands the same side up

- 原文链接: [A new pyramid-like shape always lands the same side up](https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-new-pyramid-like-shape-always-lands-the-same-side-up-20250625/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44381297)

This article is about a new kind of pyramid-shaped object—a tetrahedron—that always lands on the same side, no matter how you drop it. Mathematicians have created this shape by making its weight uneven, solving a question first asked almost 60 years ago.

The problem started long ago: John Conway, a famous mathematician, wondered if you could make a four-sided pyramid (tetrahedron) that, when made from a single material, only sits on one face. He later showed this was impossible with even weight. But if you can move the weight around inside, maybe it could work. Other shapes, like round toys, can self-right because they are curved and heavy at the bottom. For flat-faced shapes like tetrahedra, it's much harder.

Recently, mathematicians found a way. They used computers to try many shapes and weight setups. Eventually, they built a real tetrahedron using light carbon fiber for most parts and a very heavy tungsten carbide piece for balance. They had to be extremely precise—even a tiny bit of glue could ruin it. After many tries, they succeeded: the model always flips to the same face, proving the theory.

The work shows how experiments and new tools, like computers and precision engineering, help solve old math questions. The team hopes this idea could help design things like spacecraft that need to right themselves after falling over. They also learned that sometimes, simple-seeming problems need a lot of effort and technology to solve.

In the comments, people joked about the shape being a bad four-sided die (D-4) for games, since it always lands the same way. Some wondered if you could make shapes that have two stable faces, or use these ideas for security (like tamper detectors). Others discussed using balls with a heavy side, but noted that balls can roll away or land on more than one side. The difference between curved shapes like the gömböc and flat-sided ones was brought up—a gömböc can self-right but is always round, not pointy.

Some commenters were a bit disappointed that the solution needs such big differences in weight and can't be made from just one material or with simple 3D printing. Others pointed out that, for real use (like in moon landers), it doesn't matter if the object is curved or not—what matters is that it rights itself. Discussion also covered old math papers and whether they really proved what was claimed; some proofs were said to be wrong or incomplete.

A few people noted how "simple" inventions like bicycles also needed precise tools and materials to work, and this pyramid is similar—it looks simple, but is actually hard to make. Finally, some argued about the meaning of "Platonic solids" and whether weight distribution matters for the definition, while others just hoped to buy one of these cool objects for fun.

## Puerto Rico's Solar Microgrids Beat Blackout

- 原文链接: [Puerto Rico's Solar Microgrids Beat Blackout](https://spectrum.ieee.org/puerto-rico-solar-microgrids)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44382834)

This article is about how the town of Adjuntas in Puerto Rico kept its power on during an island-wide blackout, thanks to solar microgrids and battery storage. The rest of Puerto Rico had no power for over a day, but Adjuntas used a new setup to keep the lights on for homes and businesses.

The blackout happened because Puerto Rico’s main electric grid is old and has many problems, like poor maintenance and damage from hurricanes. In the past, storms like Hurricane Maria left people without power for months. The government tried to fix the grid by giving contracts to private companies and spending billions in aid, but slow rules and politics have stopped a lot of the money from being used. Now, the U.S. government is moving $365 million away from supporting rooftop solar and using it to make quick repairs to the main grid, which made some people angry, especially those who want more solar power.

Because the main grid is so weak, many people in Puerto Rico are buying their own solar panels and batteries. Each month, about 4,000 new home systems are installed. By March, over 12% of the island’s home electricity came from solar. Adjuntas tried something special: their group Casa Pueblo worked with U.S. scientists to build several microgrids that can share power with each other. This is called “grid orchestration.” If one microgrid goes down, the others keep running. During the blackout, three microgrids connected to the main grid kept working, and two more off-grid systems also stayed up. Together, they supply enough power for dozens of homes and 15 small businesses—small, but important.

Casa Pueblo is now building a lab to test more microgrid ideas. Their next step is to connect microgrids that are farther apart. As more storms and heatwaves are expected, people believe these small local systems will be even more important. The leaders say this growth in solar is not because of the government, but because normal people are paying for it themselves.

In the Hacker News comments, users praised the resilience of the microgrid system and liked the local, community-driven approach. Some said this is a good example for other places with weak grids or frequent blackouts. Others worried about the U.S. government moving money away from solar and thought it might slow down clean energy progress. A few commenters pointed out that big, central grids are hard to fix and often fail in disasters, while small, local systems can recover faster. Some users were inspired by how Puerto Ricans are not waiting for the government and are instead building their own solutions. Others asked about costs and if poor people can afford solar and batteries, saying there should be help for those who need it most. One commenter warned that even good microgrids need maintenance and planning, and that strong rules and training are important for safety. Overall, most people agreed that microgrids and solar are a smart way to make energy systems stronger, especially in places hit by storms and blackouts.

## -2000 Lines of code

- 原文链接: [-2000 Lines of code](https://www.folklore.org/Negative_2000_Lines_Of_Code.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44381252)

The article tells a story from 1982, when Apple’s Lisa team tried to measure each programmer’s work by how many lines of code they wrote each week. Bill Atkinson, a key engineer, thought this idea was silly and dangerous. Bill believed that good software should be small, fast, and simple. At the time, he had just improved Quickdraw, making it six times faster and cutting out about 2,000 lines of code. When asked to report his weekly code, he wrote “-2000” for lines of code. After that, managers stopped asking him to fill out the form.

The story shows that counting lines of code does not measure real progress. Bill’s change made the product better, even though it meant less code. The goal is not to write more code, but to make software work well. Sometimes, removing code is the most valuable work you can do. Writing extra or repeated code to look busy just makes the product worse. The article suggests that managers should judge work by the quality and usefulness of the software, not by numbers on a form.

Many commenters shared stories about deleting large amounts of code and feeling proud, saying it made systems faster and cleaner. Some said they had worked with teams where people copied and changed code instead of improving it, often to make their numbers look better. Others joked that these bad habits made it easy to delete code later. Several people mentioned that trying to measure work with simple numbers (like lines of code, or bugs fixed) leads to bad results and can even hurt morale.

Some commenters linked the story to modern tools like AI code generators, saying that these can also create a lot of extra, unneeded code. They warned that more code does not always mean better software, and that managers still sometimes make the mistake of measuring the wrong things. Others remembered times when removing code made systems much simpler and better to maintain. A few doubted whether the story happened exactly as told, but most agreed with its main point. Some said that, sadly, managers still make these mistakes today, and that good management is rare. Others pointed out that end users often do not notice code quality, but they do notice when software feels slow or buggy. Overall, the comments showed that many developers value simplicity, and wish management would too.

## OpenAI charges by the minute, so speed up your audio

- 原文链接: [OpenAI charges by the minute, so speed up your audio](https://george.mand.is/2025/06/openai-charges-by-the-minute-so-make-the-minutes-shorter/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44376989)

OpenAI charges for transcribing audio based on the length of the audio file, so the author found a way to save money by speeding up the audio before sending it for transcription. By using tools like ffmpeg to double or triple the speed of the audio, you can fit longer talks into OpenAI’s time limits, spend less, and get results faster—with little loss in transcription quality at 2x or 3x speed.

The author explains how this trick came about when he wanted to summarize a 40-minute Andrej Karpathy talk but hit OpenAI’s 25-minute upload limit. He sped up the audio to 2x and 3x, which made the file short enough to upload and also reduced the transcription cost. He shares a script using yt-dlp to extract audio from YouTube, ffmpeg to change speed, and a curl command to send it to OpenAI’s API. The author also compares the costs at different speeds: 2x and 3x speeds cut costs by up to 33% compared to sending the full-length audio. He notes that going to 4x speed made the transcription much less accurate. For most talks, 2x or 3x is the sweet spot—much faster and cheaper, but still understandable. The article also suggests removing silences from the audio for even more savings. The author mentions that YouTube’s own auto-transcription or running Whisper locally can sometimes be better or cheaper, but his main focus is on optimizing OpenAI’s API costs.

Many commenters agree the trick is clever and useful, especially for those who need fast, cheap transcriptions. Some share extra tips, like using ffmpeg’s silenceremove to cut out silent parts and save even more. Others discuss how different people have different listening speeds—some can handle talks at 2x or more, while others find even 1.5x too fast, especially for speakers who already talk quickly. There’s a debate about whether speeding up audio affects understanding, with some saying that the main ideas still come through, while others warn that you miss details and deeper thinking at higher speeds. Some suggest using local tools like Whisper to avoid privacy issues and extra costs, and note that alternative services like Groq or Deepgram can be even cheaper. A few commenters ask about accuracy: they want to see more formal tests comparing transcriptions at different speeds. Some worry about the trend of “contentmaxing”—always trying to consume more, faster—and whether it’s good for learning. Others say it’s just a practical way to get the gist when time is short. Lastly, people like that the article gives the main point right away, with code, and only adds background later—a style they wish more tech writers would use.

## Experience Making a 1-minute AI movie with my 7-year old daughter

- 原文链接: [Experience Making a 1-minute AI movie with my 7-year old daughter](https://drsandor.net/ai/minecraft/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44375696)

A father and his 7-year-old daughter made a 1-minute Minecraft-themed AI animation using just one photo as input. They used new AI tools like Wan Video, Flux Kontext, and DeepSeek, spending about 20 hours together on storyboarding, building the workflow, and rendering video clips.

The process started with a simple photo of his daughter wearing a tiger mask and a pink yukata. Using Flux Kontext, they created a storyboard by editing images and keeping the character’s look the same in each scene. Prompts like “make the character look like a pixelated Minecraft character” helped guide the AI. Storyboarding was fast and cheap, even though Flux Kontext isn’t open-source yet.

For making the video, they used Wan Video’s FLF2V-14B model, which creates short clips from a first frame, a last frame, and a text prompt. Rendering each scene took a lot of GPU time, but they tried to speed things up with a tool called Self Forcing. Sadly, Self Forcing didn’t work with their chosen model, leading to slower overall rendering.

To write good prompts for each animation, they used an LLM (Large Language Model) to describe what happens between two images. Sometimes the AI made mistakes, like forgetting the tiger’s wings, but it tried to fix them creatively, such as using a bird to add wings back. The end result was a creative, if rough, animation that amazed them with how quickly and cheaply it came together.

The main lessons were that Self Forcing is very helpful (if compatible), Wan FLF2V-14B can be tricky to use, and they hope Flux Kontext will become open-source soon. The father was impressed by how much AI has improved in just six months.

In the Hacker News comments, one user congratulated the author and said they also made animated videos with their 4-year-old daughter, using Lego and Runway. They noted that their child usually loses interest after 5–10 minutes and wondered which part of the process the author’s daughter enjoyed most. This shows that parents are interested in using AI for fun projects with kids, but keeping young children engaged can be hard. The comments were positive and supportive, with people sharing their own experiences and asking for tips. Overall, readers liked seeing how AI can bring families together for creative tech projects.

## What Problems to Solve (1966)

- 原文链接: [What Problems to Solve (1966)](http://genius.cat-v.org/richard-feynman/writtings/letters/problems)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44379606)

This letter is from Richard Feynman to a former student, who felt sad about working on "humble" scientific problems instead of big, famous ones. Feynman explains that the best problems to work on are the ones you can actually solve or help solve, no matter how small they seem.

He says it is a mistake to think only "grand" problems are valuable. Helping even one person or answering a simple question can be just as important. Feynman gives examples from his own career, like working on friction, how to stick metal to plastic, or making toys called flexagons. Many of these were small or even failures, but he enjoyed them and learned from them. He tells his student not to worry about being "nameless" or not working on big things—being useful to colleagues or family is valuable too. Feynman also admits he made a mistake by giving his student a problem, rather than letting him choose one that fit his own interest and skill. He ends by telling his student to judge himself fairly, and not by impossible standards.

In the comments, people say the letter is wise and comforting. Many are touched by Feynman's simple way of explaining deep ideas. Readers like that he shows small wins and helping others are worthwhile. One user says sometimes we need encouragement to keep working, and Feynman’s words help with that. Some feel pressure to work on "big" things, like creating famous tech products, but realize it's OK to solve everyday problems and help those around us. Others agree, saying being a good family member or colleague is enough.

Some point out that the "humble" problem the student worked on turned out to be important for science. A few readers mention how Feynman made complex things simple, and that solving any problem, big or small, can bring joy. One commenter warns that today, companies may push developers to solve problems that only benefit the company, so it’s important to choose your own path. Another says understanding what you truly want to work on is key, even if outside pressure makes it hard. There are also lighter comments, like someone noting a cheesecake recipe on the same website, and one person expressing disappointment in Feynman's personality, but still respecting his work. Overall, the letter inspires many to rethink what problems are worth their time and to value their own contributions.

## The Offline Club

- 原文链接: [The Offline Club](https://www.theoffline-club.com)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44381168)

The Offline Club is a group that helps people meet in person and spend time together without using phones or computers. It offers fun events like phone-free dinners, reading sessions, and retreats in nature, to help people relax and connect face-to-face. The website lists many cities in Europe where you can join local groups, and it explains why people like being part of the club: to have real conversations, enjoy hobbies, and take a break from screens. There are also options for businesses to organize offline events for their teams, and you can even start a new chapter if your city does not have one yet. Reviews from members say they love the calm atmosphere and the chance to make friends. The club has been featured in big newspapers, and it now has events in 11 cities across 7 countries.

Many comments on Hacker News compare The Offline Club to Meetup, an older service for group events. Some say Meetup lost its way because of changes in management and too many online events after COVID. Others point out common problems for groups like this: finding good places to meet, getting people to actually show up, and stopping events from turning into sales pitches or being taken over by people with bad intentions. Some people suggest that making events a bit harder to join, or charging a fee, can help attract only those who are really interested.

A few users share tips from their own experience: talking to local cafes for space, sending personal messages to remind people, or even overbooking events to handle last-minute cancellations. There is talk about the balance between making events too formal and keeping them open and friendly. Some wish there were more “third spaces,” like libraries or game stores, where people can meet without spending much money. Others remember how clubs and user groups used to work before everything moved online.

There is also debate about whether scheduled events or spontaneous visits are better for real friendships. Some think scheduling is too formal, while others say it’s respectful and needed, especially as adults get busier. A few people point out that joining an event helps you meet new people, but building true friendships takes more time and regular contact. Some remember the old days when you could just drop by a neighbor’s house, but others say this was never common in their culture. Overall, most agree that finding ways to unplug and meet people in real life is important, even if it takes effort to make it work.
