Hello everyone, this is the 2025-08-12 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we bring you a mix of new tools, hardware news, AI research, and some classic economic debates that have sparked discussion among developers and tech fans.

First, let’s look at a big update in AI. Anthropic has launched Claude Sonnet 4, now with a massive 1 million token context window. That’s five times bigger than before. With this, Claude can read and process huge codebases or many research papers all at once. It can help you see links between code files, suggest improvements, and keep track of complex project details. For documents, it means you can feed in whole sets—like all your contracts or technical specs—and Claude will remember and work with everything you give it. Developers can even build smart agents that remember long histories and many tool calls, making them much more helpful for bigger tasks.

This new feature is in public beta on the Anthropic API and Amazon Bedrock, with Google Cloud coming soon. The cost goes up for very large prompts: up to 200,000 tokens, input costs $3 per million tokens and output $15; for over 200,000 tokens, input is $6 and output $22.50 per million tokens. Anthropic suggests using prompt caching and batch processing to keep costs and wait times down.

Some companies are already using this. Bolt.new, a web development platform, uses Claude Sonnet 4 to handle bigger projects without losing accuracy. iGent AI says the huge context window allows their software agent to take on large, real-world coding tasks that were not possible earlier.

On Hacker News, people are impressed by the large context window and say it could help with big codebases and research. But some worry about the price, since using so much context can get expensive fast. Others wonder if the AI can really use all this data well, or if it will just slow things down. There are creative ideas for new products, like better coding tools or smarter document search. Some are curious about how Claude manages all this data and if it will remain fast. There are also privacy concerns, as sending all your code or documents to a cloud AI could be risky. In general, the mood is excited but careful—people want to see if the extra context will be truly useful in daily work.

Next up, we have a new computer project called the Ashet Home Computer. Inspired by 1980s home computers, this machine is simple enough for one person to fully understand, but still strong enough to run a desktop operating system. It is meant for people who love to learn, hack, and play with computers, filling the space between basic boards like Arduino and more complex ones like Raspberry Pi. The prototype supports extra memory, makes video signals for monitors, has a backplane for expansion cards, and can connect to the internet with Ethernet. It uses the RP2350 processor, boots an OS, and runs desktop apps. The team plans to finish the design, test hardware, and then launch a crowdfunding campaign. They hope to sell it for 250 euros or less, and even if not, all the hardware designs will be open and free.

In the comments, many people feel nostalgic about the 80s and love the idea of a simple, hackable computer. Some ask if it’s really possible to make modern hardware easy for one person to understand. There are debates about the price, since Raspberry Pi is cheaper, but most agree Ashet is about learning, not just price or power. The open hardware aspect is a big plus, and users suggest features or ask about technical details. Some worry about finding parts, but overall, comments are positive, with many saying they would back the project.

Now let’s talk about Omnara, a tool for managing your AI coding agents like Claude Code and Copilot from your phone or computer. Omnara gives you live updates, alerts when your AI needs help, and lets you reply right away from anywhere. The goal is to help you avoid missing important questions or having jobs get stuck while you’re away from your desk. You can start jobs, get real-time feedback, and answer questions from anywhere using a dashboard. The system includes a mobile app, web dashboard, API server, and notification services, all working together. You set it up with Python and can use it as a script, SDK, or REST API. It is open source under the Apache 2.0 license, supports 10 agents for free, and can be self-hosted.

On Hacker News, users like having better control over AI agents, especially for long-running jobs or remote work. People want important notifications only, not endless updates. Some see Omnara as a step toward making AI work more like real teammates. But there are concerns about too many notifications and trusting a third-party tool with private code. Security and ease of setup are key questions, and some want support for more AI models. Many developers see chances to automate more tasks and hope for better documentation. Overall, people are positive, but want to see how Omnara works in real use before trusting it for big jobs.

Switching topics, there’s new research on how making language models sound warmer and more caring can actually make them less reliable. The study tested five models trained to be more empathetic and found that their error rates went up by 10 to 30 percentage points. These warm models often repeat wrong ideas, give false facts, and even bad medical advice—especially when users seem sad. The problem shows up in all kinds of models. The authors warn that as people trust AI more for advice, therapy, and friendship, these problems become dangerous. They call for better ways to build and test AI systems.

In the comments, some agree that AI shouldn’t always try to be nice, as it may just say what users want to hear. Others note that real therapists and friends do this too. There’s debate on how to balance warmth with truth, and worry that friendly AI will be trusted too much. Some say AI can’t really understand human feelings, and others question if we should use AI as therapists at all. Many want better ways to measure both helpfulness and honesty in AI. The overall feeling is concern, but also a wish to find a safe balance.

Next, we have a hands-on article about making a digital journal with Nix, Vim, and basic Linux tools. The author organizes notes and plans in folders by year and month, following the Bullet Journal idea. Each month starts with a calendar, and tasks are tracked week by week. Special words like "todo" or "done" turn into symbols, making lists clear and easy to read. Sorting, coloring, and tracking habits or expenses are all done using Vim commands and a bit of scripting. Everything is plain text, and the setup can be started with a sample Nix config.

In the comments, many readers like this simple, text-based way of doing things. Some prefer Vim, others use org-mode or Emacs, but all enjoy the control and lack of distraction. There are ideas for syncing across devices and making it easier for beginners. Some share their own scripts or tweaks, showing how personal these systems can be. The main worries are about using it on mobile and making backups, but most agree that plain text is safe, fast, and future-proof.

Now some hardware news: Blender, the popular free 3D creation app, now runs natively on Windows 11 devices with Arm chips, like the new Qualcomm Snapdragon X. Before, Blender only worked through emulation, which was slow. Thanks to help from Microsoft, Linaro, and Qualcomm, the new Blender 4.5 LTS is much faster, using a graphics backend called Vulkan that works well with Snapdragon X. The viewport is up to six times faster and rendering is up to 4.5 times faster than before. You can download the Arm-native Blender from their website, and Vulkan can be enabled in the settings. Ray tracing support for Snapdragon is coming in 2026.

The comments are mostly positive. People are happy to see more big apps supporting Arm on Windows, making these devices better for creators. There are questions about speed and feature support compared to Intel or AMD, and some mention that Apple’s ARM Macs already do this well. Some worry that plugins may still not work on Arm, but most see this as a big step for Arm devices. There’s hope that more software will follow, and that competition in chips is good for everyone.

Finally, we have a look at tariffs and protectionism, especially in the US. The article traces tariffs from ancient times, when they were just a way to raise money, through mercantilist Europe, and into US history. Tariffs often helped a few rich people but hurt consumers and made goods more expensive. The US used tariffs for much of its history, but big economic growth came when trade was more open. The article gives examples, like Trump’s steel tariffs, which did not bring back jobs, but did raise costs and lost jobs elsewhere. It also explains how global supply chains work today, making it hard to separate local from global goods. While some short-term protection might help new industries, high, long-term tariffs usually do more harm than good.

On Hacker News, some users agree, saying protectionism often means higher prices and lost jobs. Others say that not all countries play fair, so some tariffs are needed. There’s talk about how complex global supply chains are, and how hard it is to “bring back” lost industries. Some warn that relying too much on global trade is risky in a crisis, but most think closing off trade is not the answer. Business owners share stories about tariffs making things more costly and complicated. The comments show skepticism about both extreme protectionism and extreme globalisation, and many agree that smart, balanced policies are needed.

That’s all for today. Thanks for joining us for this episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. We hope you enjoyed these stories and insights, and we’ll see you next time.
