## Logging Sucks

- 原文链接: [Logging Sucks](https://loggingsucks.com/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46346796)

This article talks about how logging in most software systems is broken and why your logs often do not help when things go wrong. The author shows that in modern systems, logs are missing important context and are hard to search, which makes debugging painful and slow.

The article says that logs today are made for old systems, where you had just one server and could check things easily. Now, a single user’s request can go through many services, databases, and queues, but logs still act like it’s simple. When there is a problem, you search logs by user ID or email, but you get too many results or not enough details. Sometimes, the same data is saved in many different ways, making search harder.

The main problem is that logs are made to be easy to write, not easy to use. Developers write simple log lines, but don’t think about how to find problems later. The article explains terms like “structured logging” (using key-value or JSON logs), “cardinality” (how many unique values a field can have, like user IDs), and “dimensionality” (how many fields each log has). 

The author says that structured logging is good, but not enough. What you need is a “wide event” or “canonical log line”—a single, big log entry for each request, with lots of fields. This entry should include everything important: user info, request path, payment details, errors, feature flags, and more. With this, you can quickly answer questions like “why did checkout fail for this user?” or “are premium users seeing more errors?”

The article also talks about OpenTelemetry. It says OpenTelemetry is only a tool for moving data; it does not decide what details to log. You must still add the right business data yourself.

To avoid high logging costs, the author suggests “sampling”—keeping only some logs. But, you should always keep logs for errors, slow requests, VIP users, and special cases. Only sample random normal requests.

Many people mix up structured logging and wide events. The article says wide events are a way of thinking: one big, full log per request. Some people think tracing is enough, but tracing and wide events give different, useful details. Others say high-cardinality data is too expensive, but new tools can handle it well.

In the comments, many people agree that logs are often hard to use. Some say they spend too much time searching for the right log or building one-time tools to find issues. Others mention that their companies use basic logs and think it’s enough, but they still struggle during outages. 

A few readers like the idea of wide events, saying it would save time and give better answers. Some warn that it’s hard to change old habits or update big codebases to use this style. Others bring up the cost of storing so much data, but some reply that new databases like ClickHouse make this easier.

Some people worry that adding too many fields to logs will slow down their systems or make logs harder to read. Others disagree, saying with the right tools, searching big, structured logs is fast and useful. There is also advice to start small—maybe add wide events only for important actions or errors first.

A few commenters share stories about missing key info in logs and having to guess what happened. Others say that good logs helped them fix big problems in minutes. Some people also debate if logs and metrics should be different, but others agree with the article that having one source of truth is better.

Overall, the main feeling is that logging is often ignored until there’s a problem, and that better logging with more context would help everyone. Many want to try wide events, but know it will take work to get there.

## A Guide to Local Coding Models

- 原文链接: [A Guide to Local Coding Models](https://www.aiforswes.com/p/you-dont-need-to-spend-100mo-on-claude)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46348329)

This article looks at whether you can save money by running AI coding models on your own computer, instead of paying $100 or more each month for cloud tools like Claude Code. The author bought a powerful MacBook with 128 GB of RAM to test if local models could really replace these expensive subscriptions.

They found that local coding models are much better than most people think. In fact, for about 90% of typical developer tasks, local models work almost as well as top cloud models. Even small models with 7 billion parameters can be quite good. Local models save you money, let you keep your data private, and work even if you have no internet. They also don’t depend on cloud providers, so you avoid outages or sudden changes.

However, the last 10% of coding tasks—usually the hardest ones—are where cloud models still win. If you do important work, that last bit of quality is worth the subscription fee. The author realized their test was more helpful for hobbyists or people working on side projects, not for teams or companies. For businesses, paid cloud tools are still best.

Setting up local models is not always simple. You need to understand how much RAM the models need. Large models (like 30 billion parameters) can use over 60 GB of memory, and the context window (the model’s “memory” for the current task) uses even more. You can save memory by using “quantization,” which makes the model use fewer bits for each value, but this can hurt performance if you go too far.

The article explains two main ways to run local models: Ollama (easy to use, works on all computers) and MLX (faster, but Mac-only). The author used MLX for speed but said Ollama is great for beginners. They recommend trying different coding tools, like Qwen Code or Aider, because not all tools work well with all models.

For setup, you pick the right model size for your RAM, use a serving tool (like MLX), and connect it to your coding tool. The author shared scripts and setup tips to make this easier. They also advise watching your memory usage to avoid slowing down your computer.

At first, the author thought buying a powerful computer and skipping cloud subscriptions would save money in the long run. But after testing, they realized local models are not quite good enough for serious professional use. Still, local models can help reduce costs by letting you use cheaper or free cloud tiers for the hardest tasks, while doing most work for free on your own machine.

Now, looking at Hacker News comments, many people were excited about the idea of local models, especially for privacy and saving money. Some shared their own setups, often using smaller models on less powerful computers. Others pointed out that the real pain point is how tricky setup can be, and how buggy some tools are.

A few commenters agreed with the author that the final 10% in quality is very important for professional work. Some said companies should not risk using weaker local models for production code. Others thought that, as local models keep improving, the gap with cloud models will shrink, and more people will switch to local setups.

Some people said free tools like Google Gemini or OpenAI’s free tier make it hard to justify buying expensive hardware just for coding help. Others worried that if everyone moves to local models, companies might make cloud tools less generous or more expensive.

A few praised the detailed technical explanations, especially about quantization and memory usage. Some warned that even with the best setup, running big models can make your computer slow or hot, and you need to balance speed, cost, and convenience.

Finally, some users said they prefer the flexibility of switching between local and cloud tools for different tasks, and liked the idea of combining both for the best experience. Many agreed that local models are getting better fast, and this is a space to keep watching.

This post shares a tool that tracks books most often mentioned on Hacker News in 2025. The tool shows which books are popular in tech and startup circles, with data pulled from many podcast episodes.

The article discusses how copyright laws may not be fair for everyone, especially when only a few people get rich from popular works like Harry Potter. It says that enjoying creative works and sharing them should help more people, not just a few. The author points out that J.K. Rowling got rich from Harry Potter, but many other talented writers do not get the same chance.

Some people find reading hard when forced in school, but books like Harry Potter helped them enjoy reading again. There’s talk about using popular books to learn new languages, for example by reading or listening to Harry Potter in another language. The article lists the most mentioned books in tech podcasts: “Made in America” by Sam Walton, “7 Powers” by Hamilton Helmer, “Zero to One” by Peter Thiel, “Against the Odds” by James Dyson, and “Harry Potter” by J.K. Rowling.

The post also talks about how some families or schools ban books like Harry Potter for religious or cultural reasons. Others say that even if an author has personal views they do not agree with, they can still enjoy the books.

There’s a discussion about copyright and ideas: copying whole books for profit is different from using short quotes or training AI with book texts. When people write fan fiction or talk about books, it helps make those books more famous.

Now, looking at the comments, people share different opinions. Some agree that copyright should be rethought, especially for very famous books. Others think writers should keep control of their work because they created it. Some users remember being banned from reading Harry Potter as kids, but found ways to read it anyway.

Many people say Harry Potter helped them love reading, while others prefer more serious literature. There’s debate about separating art from the artist—some say you can enjoy a book even if you don’t like the author. Some parents want their kids to read only “high culture,” while others think it’s okay to read popular books.

A few commenters share tools for learning languages with books, and suggest ways to enjoy stories in more than one language. Some argue that, once a book gets super famous, it becomes part of public culture, and maybe copyright rules should change.

Overall, people have strong feelings about books, reading habits, copyright, and how stories shape culture. The post and comments show that books like Harry Potter spark many different ideas and debates among tech people.

## The gift card accountability sink

- 原文链接: [The gift card accountability sink](https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/gift-card-accountability-sink/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46348455)

This article talks about how gift cards work and why they are often used in scams. It explains that gift cards are a big business, used by many companies, and not just a tool for scammers.

Gift card scams happen when criminals trick people into buying gift cards and sharing the card numbers. The scammer then turns this value into cash or other things, making it hard to trace. In the U.S., people are better protected from fraud if they use debit or credit cards, because banks usually return stolen money. But with gift cards, there is almost no protection—if you're scammed, you are likely to lose your money forever.

Most companies do not manage their own gift card systems. They hire special companies, called program managers, to handle the technical and legal details. This setup makes it hard to know who is responsible when things go wrong. If you call the store after being scammed, they may say they only sell and accept gift cards, but do not issue or control them. Their fraud team often cannot help you, because they do not have access to the needed information.

Gift cards are not regulated like normal bank cards. There are laws that protect debit and credit card users, but gift cards are left out of these rules. If you report a gift card scam, you might just be told to contact the police, but this rarely helps you get your money back. The reason for these weaker rules is to make it easy for stores to sell gift cards and for people without bank accounts to use them.

Industry groups and lobbyists have worked to keep gift card rules simple. The government allows small gift card sales with little oversight, only checking bigger transactions. This means scammers know which gift cards are easiest to use and target those brands.

In the end, the article says gift cards are designed this way for good reasons, but it also means regular people can get hurt. Groups like AARP warn people that being asked to pay with gift cards is always a scam, but that's not fully true—sometimes businesses do use gift cards as payment for real reasons.

People in the comments had strong opinions. Some agreed with the article, saying gift cards are too easy to use for scams and need better rules. Others noted that not everyone has a bank account, so gift cards help people who are "unbanked," making them valuable. A few commenters shared stories about family or friends losing money to gift card scams and feeling frustrated that nobody could help them.

Some technical readers talked about how the system is split between stores and program managers, which causes confusion and makes it hard to track fraud. A few suggested that the government should make gift cards follow the same fraud rules as credit cards. Others worried that new rules would make it harder for people who really need gift cards.

There was debate about whether stores should take more responsibility when their gift cards are used in scams. Some said it's unfair to expect stores to fix problems they can't control, while others argued that big companies should do more to protect their customers. A couple of people pointed out that scam warnings don't always work, since scammers can be very convincing, especially with older or vulnerable people.

In summary, the comments showed that gift cards are both a useful tool and a big risk, and there is no simple answer to fixing the problems. Many agreed that people should be careful, but the system itself might need to change to stop so many scams.

## More on whether useful quantum computing is "imminent"

- 原文链接: [More on whether useful quantum computing is "imminent"](https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=9425)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46348318)

This article is about whether useful quantum computing is close to happening, and why the author, Scott Aaronson, is now more optimistic than before. He explains that he changed his view because of strong progress in quantum hardware over the last year, rather than any big change in theory.

Scott went to a big quantum conference (Q2B) and saw major companies like Quantinuum and Google show real results using trapped ions and superconducting qubits. He says some companies are working hard on real problems, while others are just selling hype for investors. The main uses for quantum computers are still the same as before: simulating quantum physics and chemistry, breaking some cryptography, and maybe small improvements for optimization and machine learning in the future. He warns that while hardware is improving quickly—with some systems now reaching high reliability—it is still not clear exactly when truly useful machines will arrive or which technology will win.

Scott also points out that the loud promises from companies about quantum computing in the next few years should now be taken more seriously, because hardware is getting better faster than many expected. But he also warns against too much hype, especially from companies that exaggerate what quantum computers can do, or claim they will “never hallucinate” like AI. He reminds readers that the real quantum advantage is still mostly in areas related to physics, not general business problems. Finally, he gives a warning about security: as quantum computers get better, old encryption could become breakable, so moving to new “post-quantum” encryption is urgent.

In the comment section, many readers agree that the hardware progress is impressive, but they are still unsure if “useful” quantum computing is very close. Some think the main applications, like breaking cryptography, are still years away, and say the field should focus on real results, not hype. Others note that every year the timeline for “quantum advantage” moves a bit further, so they are cautious about big promises. A few readers defend the need for optimism and point out that all big technologies had doubters before they became real. Some users criticize companies that focus more on raising money than solving hard technical problems. There is also discussion about whether quantum computers will really help with things like machine learning, or if that is just marketing talk. Some warn that governments and investors might waste money chasing hype, while others say that investment is needed to get real progress. Finally, some agree with Scott’s point that security changes for quantum computers need to start now, not later.

## Mullvad VPN: "This is a Chat Control 3.0 attempt."

- 原文链接: [Mullvad VPN: "This is a Chat Control 3.0 attempt."](https://mastodon.online/@mullvadnet/115742530333573065)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46347080)

The article is about Mullvad VPN warning that the European Union is planning new laws called "Going Dark" or "ProtectEU" to let police access encrypted data, and this time they want VPNs included. Mullvad says this is a new version of "Chat Control," which was an earlier proposal to scan private messages, and they promise to fight the new plan just as much.

The EU lost the last battle to control end-to-end encryption, but they plan to try again by 2026, aiming for even more control. Some countries in the EU want the laws to include VPN services, not just messaging apps. They also want to keep more metadata, like which websites you visit and who you talk to, as widely as possible. Mullvad says they have fought these proposals for years, even though such laws could help their business. They promise never to spy on their users, even if new laws demand it.

Mullvad also says that if the law passes, they will still protect their users’ privacy and not keep logs or data. They point out that they don’t know who their users are, so they cannot spy on them anyway. Mullvad warns that these moves are about centralizing power and controlling citizens, not real security. They say fighting these laws is the right thing to do, even if it means trouble for their company.

Many comments agree with Mullvad and are worried about government overreach. Some say this is a problem with too much central power in the EU and suggest decentralization as a solution. Others joke about the endless attempts to pass such laws and say politicians should find better things to do. Some users ask how Mullvad can promise not to spy if forced by law, and others reply that Mullvad’s system means they don’t know their users. Some comments compare these laws to those in Russia and worry about a global trend to ban VPNs. A few praise Mullvad for honesty and say they will stay customers for life. Others complain that lawmakers don’t understand encryption and call these efforts pointless and dangerous. Some wish governments would focus on real problems instead of spying on their people. There are also jokes about how these laws just keep coming back, and some people are losing trust in the EU. Overall, most commenters support Mullvad and fear the new laws would hurt privacy and freedom.

## I Program on the Subway

- 原文链接: [I Program on the Subway](https://www.scd31.com/posts/programming-on-the-subway)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46294694)

This article is about someone who writes code on the subway in New York City because they have less free time now and want to use their commute better. The writer explains that programming without their usual setup—no big monitors, no fast internet, no fancy keyboard—actually helps them focus, since there are fewer distractions. Sometimes they use WiFi at subway stops to download something quickly, but most of the time, they just code offline and check if things compile. The author works on low-level code for side projects and says not being able to run or test things right away makes them think more about what the code will do. 

They admit it’s hard to keep complex ideas in their head on the train, especially with loud noises, so they do simpler tasks or write plans in a notebook if needed. The laptop they use is a cheap, old ThinkPad, so they're not too worried about theft, though friends joke about it. Sometimes, people ask what they're doing, which leads to interesting conversations and even new friends. The biggest problem is finding a seat during busy hours; it’s hard to code while standing up, though the writer is working on a way to attach a keyboard to their pants and use special glasses for a screen. 

They encourage others to try programming on the subway, saying it builds focus and makes good use of travel time. 

In the comment section, some people love the idea and share their own stories of working on trains or buses, saying it’s a good way to stay productive. Others point out that programming in public can be tough because of noise and movement, or because it’s not safe everywhere. A few mention that not having internet can be a problem if you need to look things up, but others agree it helps them focus better. Some suggest using tablets or even just a notebook and pen for planning when a laptop isn’t practical. A few worry about the risk of theft or someone looking over their shoulder, but others think it’s fine if you’re careful and have a cheap device. There are also comments about the social side, with people saying they like meeting new people who are curious about tech. One or two readers think the idea is strange, but most agree it’s a creative way to use lost time. Some even say they might try it themselves.

## E.W.Dijkstra Archive

- 原文链接: [E.W.Dijkstra Archive](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/welcome.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46345523)

The E.W. Dijkstra Archive is a website that collects the writings and legacy of Edsger W. Dijkstra, a key figure in computer science. Dijkstra’s work shaped many fields, such as algorithms, programming, operating systems, and formal methods.

The archive includes more than a thousand of Dijkstra’s technical notes, called “EWDs.” For years, Dijkstra shared these notes with colleagues by mail and photocopies. Many of these writings were not formally published, so the website makes them easier to find and read. The site offers indexes to search the manuscripts by number, title, or topic. Some documents are transcribed to make them searchable and accessible for people with visual impairments. There are also some translations from Dutch, Russian, and Spanish, though translations are now rare because they are difficult to do well.

The site welcomes volunteers to help transcribe documents and correct errors. There are links between related EWDs, summaries for some documents, and information about copyrights. Besides the manuscripts, the archive has audio and video of Dijkstra’s talks and interviews. It shares memories, obituaries, and essays about his life and impact. The archive mentions the Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing, which honors his foundational work on concurrency. There is also a list of annual Dijkstra Memorial Lectures.

The site is updated from time to time, and feedback is welcome from readers. It links to a related website on disciplined mathematical thinking, influenced by Dijkstra’s ideas.

In the Hacker News comments, many people share how Dijkstra’s writings influenced their thinking about programming and software. Some users praise his clear, precise writing style and his focus on simplicity. Others say they find some of his ideas challenging or strict, but still helpful for learning and improving their skills. A few mention that the EWDs can be hard to read because of the scanned PDF format or because the language is formal. Several commenters thank the archive’s team for making these documents available, while others discuss Dijkstra’s famous quotes and his strong opinions—sometimes controversial—about computer science education and software practices. There is agreement that Dijkstra’s work is still important today, especially for people who want to understand the “why” behind programming, not just the “how.” Some users also share their favorite EWDs or stories about using Dijkstra’s ideas in their own projects.

## I can't upgrade to Windows 11, now leave me alone

- 原文链接: [I can't upgrade to Windows 11, now leave me alone](https://idiallo.com/byte-size/cant-update-to-windows-11-leave-me-alone)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46347108)

This article talks about a user who cannot upgrade their laptop to Windows 11 because it does not have TPM 2.0, a special security chip. The user is tired of Microsoft showing upgrade reminders every time they turn on the computer, even though the system already knows the laptop cannot be upgraded.

The writer explains that their laptop is still powerful, but it is about 10 years old and does not have this TPM 2.0 chip. Microsoft keeps pushing reminders to upgrade, but there is no real way to say “no” or stop these messages. The only options are “remind me later” or “learn more,” which just shows ads for new laptops. The writer thinks this is not a mistake but something Microsoft designed on purpose. They say Microsoft is being unfriendly to users by not letting them decline the upgrade and by trying to force them to buy new hardware.

The writer is annoyed that after paying for a computer and the pro version of Windows, Microsoft still tries to make them use extra services like OneDrive or sign in with a Microsoft account. They joke that maybe Microsoft should have to follow their own rules and ask for permission before connecting to the internet. The notification pop-up is run by apps called “Reusable UX Interaction Manager” or “Campaign Manager.”

In the comments, many people agree that these upgrade reminders are annoying and hard to stop. Some say they have the same problem and feel like their computer is not really theirs anymore. Others explain ways to try to block or remove the reminders, but these solutions are often complex or do not always work. A few people defend Microsoft, saying that keeping people up to date is important for security, but most think the company should respect users’ choices, especially if the device cannot be upgraded. Some worry that this is part of a larger trend where companies control more of what users can do with their own devices. Others say this is why they use other systems like Linux, or why they avoid Windows when possible. There are also jokes about how Microsoft’s choices push people to buy new computers, even when their old ones work fine. Some users discuss the technical side of TPM 2.0 and how some machines might support it if enabled in the BIOS, but the original poster’s main issue is the forceful reminders and lack of a “no thanks” option.
