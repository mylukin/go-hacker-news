## AirSnitch: Demystifying and breaking client isolation in Wi-Fi networks [pdf]

- 原文链接: [AirSnitch: Demystifying and breaking client isolation in Wi-Fi networks [pdf]](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2026-f1282-paper.pdf)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47167763)

This article looks at Wi-Fi “client isolation,” a feature that claims to stop devices on the same network from talking to each other, and tests if it really works. The researchers check how well client isolation protects users on home and business Wi-Fi networks, and they find many ways this protection can be broken.

The main points are: Most Wi-Fi routers use a “group key” (GTK) to send broadcast messages, and this key is actually shared with all users. Even with client isolation enabled, an attacker on the same network can use the GTK to send messages straight to another device, or even trick devices into accepting fake messages. Some routers only block direct connections at one layer (like the MAC address layer), but attackers can still reach other users using the IP layer—sending packets through the router’s gateway (“gateway bouncing”). Attackers can also copy (“spoof”) another device’s MAC address to steal its traffic, or make the router send messages meant for the victim to the attacker instead (“port stealing”). The paper shows that these tricks work on many popular routers and even on some university networks. They test different devices and show that most operating systems (like Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS) will accept these kinds of injected packets. The attacks can be used to become a “man-in-the-middle,” meaning the attacker can read and change all the victim’s internet traffic—even encrypted HTTPS in some cases. The researchers give technical details for each attack and show that no router or network they tested was safe from all of them.

Looking at the top comments, some people are surprised that such basic attacks still work in 2026, and they point out that Wi-Fi security is much more confusing than it should be. One user says they always thought client isolation was strong, but now see it is only a “band-aid” and not a real fix. Others mention that the lack of a Wi-Fi standard for client isolation leads to these issues—router makers all do it differently and often badly. Some folks ask about VLANs for better isolation, and the authors say VLANs help but are not used much at home. A few developers worry about IoT devices because they often join guest networks, thinking they’re safe, but this research shows they aren’t. One commenter notes that even expensive enterprise gear is vulnerable if not set up with extra steps. Some suggest using end-to-end encryption (like VPNs or MACsec) as a better way to stay safe. Others are happy to see the research code is open source, so people can check their own networks. Finally, several people agree that Wi-Fi security needs better standards and more clear options for users, because most people just trust the default settings and think they are protected when they might not be.

- 原文链接: [Launch HN: Cardboard (YC W26) – Agentic video editor](https://www.usecardboard.com/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47170174)

This article is about Cardboard, a new video editor that uses AI to help people edit videos much faster. The main idea is that Cardboard can turn raw video clips into a finished, ready-to-share video in just a few minutes.

Cardboard says it can do the boring parts of editing, like cutting out silences or adding captions, with only a few clicks. You can ask it to make changes using plain language, and the AI will understand and update the video timeline for you. It has special tools for different types of videos, like vlogs, montages, podcasts, launch videos, and explainers. Cardboard can find clips based on what happens in them, not just their names, which helps users work faster. The tool also supports live collaboration, so teams can edit together in real time without sending files back and forth. Some features include smart trimming, automatic color grading, and adding music or voiceovers. The app is designed to make a strong first edit quickly, so users only need to make small changes after. Cardboard is backed by Y Combinator and is used by some tech companies already. Pricing starts at $60 per month, and there is a free trial.

In the comment section, many people are interested in how well the AI actually works for real editing tasks. Some users think $60 a month is expensive, especially compared to other video editors. Others say that if Cardboard saves a lot of time, it might be worth the price for professionals. A few users wonder if the AI makes mistakes or if users still need to check every detail before publishing. Some commenters like the idea of searching for clips by their content, not filenames. Others ask if Cardboard supports all video formats and if it works well for larger projects. A few users are excited about live collaboration, while others still prefer editing by hand for more control. Some people think AI video editing is the future, but others are worried it will take away creative jobs. Overall, users are curious but want to see more real-world examples and maybe a lower price for small creators.

## Will vibe coding end like the maker movement?

- 原文链接: [Will vibe coding end like the maker movement?](https://read.technically.dev/p/vibe-coding-and-the-maker-movement)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47167931)

The article looks at “vibe coding,” a trend where people quickly build software using AI, and asks if it will end like the earlier Maker Movement. The Maker Movement promised to change how we build things with tools like 3D printers, but it faded after its big ideas didn’t come true.

The article says both movements started with excitement and new tools. In the Maker era, people built projects for fun, learning, or just to see what was possible, not to make money. This playful time helped people get better at their craft, develop judgment, and form communities. But vibe coding skipped this step. Instead of starting small and playful, AI coding tools were pushed into serious work right away. Now, there is pressure to build real products fast, and less time for learning through play.

The Maker Movement wanted to change the world with new factories and local production, but in the end, only prototyping became easy—real manufacturing stayed with big companies overseas. In vibe coding, AI helps people build demos and apps fast, but the real value goes to the AI companies, not the coders. People can make things quickly, but they may not gain deep skills, and their hard work often just helps improve the AI models.

The article argues that instead of thinking of vibe coding as craft or creation, it’s more like consumption. AI gives us a lot of extra “brainpower,” and vibe coding is a way to use it up—like spending energy that is already there. This is not always bad: by making lots of quick projects, people can learn what works, build taste, and get attention or reputation in their field. Sharing these projects, even if they are simple or silly, can help people connect and gain new chances.

But the article warns that vibe coding can make people feel busy or productive, but it’s easy to lose track of what is actually good or useful. Sometimes, people just enjoy the feeling of building, without clear results. The fast pace can also lead to burnout if you expect deep personal growth from the process, like with traditional craft. Instead, the article recommends seeing vibe coding as a way to spend surplus energy from AI, and suggests focusing on what you can learn or share, not just what you produce.

People on Hacker News had many opinions. Some agreed that the Maker Movement ended because the tools were fun but not useful enough for big change, and they see the same risk with vibe coding. Others think vibe coding is different, because AI tools are so powerful that they really can change how people work, even if the first projects are simple. A few commenters liked the “consumption” idea, saying it matches how they feel when using AI—busy, but not always building something lasting.

Some worried that AI tools make it too easy to skip learning the basics, so people might not really understand what they are building. Others pointed out that showing off quick demos can win attention, but may not lead to real skills or strong products. Some said that even if most vibe coding projects are useless, a few will become important, just like in the early web. A few commenters felt sad that the playful “scenius” phase is missing, while others thought maybe it’s just happening in new places, like Discord or Twitter.

Overall, many agreed that AI is changing how we build things, but they are unsure if it will help people grow or just help companies collect more data. Some hope that even if vibe coding is fast and shallow, it will still lead to new ideas and communities in the long run. Others think we need better ways to keep learning and sharing, so the cycle does not end up like the Maker Movement.

## What Claude Code Chooses

- 原文链接: [What Claude Code Chooses](https://amplifying.ai/research/claude-code-picks)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47169757)

This article is about a study that tests what tools Claude Code (an AI coding assistant) picks when asked to solve real programming problems. The researchers ran 2,430 prompts on real code projects, using open-ended questions and no tool names, to see which tools Claude Code would choose.

Claude Code often chooses to build custom solutions instead of picking popular third-party tools. For example, when asked to add feature flags, it writes its own config system instead of picking a tool like LaunchDarkly. When asked to handle authentication in Python, it writes code from scratch using JWT and bcrypt rather than using an existing library. This "build, not buy" approach is most common in 12 out of 20 tool categories tested. But when Claude Code does pick a tool, it does so clearly and often defaults to popular choices—like GitHub Actions for CI/CD, Stripe for payments, shadcn/ui for UI, Zustand for state management, and Sentry for observability.

The AI picks tools more often in the JavaScript ecosystem than in others, and usually chooses the most popular ones. Some tools with big market share (like certain API layers and package managers) are rarely picked. Newer Claude models tend to choose newer tools, showing a clear shift over time—like moving from Prisma to Drizzle for JavaScript ORMs, or from Redis to custom caching for Python.

Deployment choices are also strong: Claude Code always picks Vercel for JavaScript frontends and Railway for Python backends, with traditional clouds like AWS or Azure barely mentioned. The models agree in most categories, but sometimes switch their preferred tools as new versions are released.

People in the comments discuss why Claude Code builds its own solutions so often. Some think this is risky, because writing your own auth or feature flags can lead to security bugs and more maintenance work. Others feel it shows Claude is careful not to assume you want extra dependencies, and that it’s trying to be flexible and not lock you into one vendor. Commenters notice that Claude’s tool choices reflect current trends and may shape what new projects use, for better or worse. Some think this could make the AI a tastemaker, pushing certain tools to the top. A few wish the AI would better explain its choices, or ask more clarifying questions before picking a tool. Some users are surprised that cloud providers like AWS or GCP are rarely picked, and wonder if this will change as Claude is updated. Others point out that custom code is sometimes needed, but that recommending it by default could be a bad habit for new programmers. Overall, people find the study interesting and want to see how Claude’s choices will shift as new tools come out.

## OsmAnd's Faster Offline Navigation

- 原文链接: [OsmAnd's Faster Offline Navigation](https://osmand.net/blog/fast-routing/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47170157)

OsmAnd has made offline navigation much faster by creating a new routing system called Highway Hierarchy (HH) Routing. The article explains how the old A* routing algorithm became too slow for big or complex routes, so OsmAnd built a new method that is up to 100 times faster.

The old A* algorithm was very flexible and let users make custom routes, but it could be slow for long trips. Other common fast algorithms, like Contraction Hierarchies, were not a good fit for OsmAnd because they used too much storage, were hard to update, and did not support the many custom options OsmAnd offers. So, OsmAnd designed their own system.

The new HH-Routing works by first dividing the map into clusters, or small regions. Each cluster has a few important “border points” where you enter or leave the area. OsmAnd finds these border points using a special method that looks for natural bottlenecks, like the main exits of a parking lot. They use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to help find these spots.

For each cluster, OsmAnd pre-calculates shortcuts between these border points, so it knows the fastest way through each area. When you ask for a route, OsmAnd quickly finds the best path between border points using a small, simple map. Then, it fills in the details by running a more detailed search only within each cluster you pass through. This means it doesn’t need to check every road on the whole route, saving a lot of time and storage.

The system is flexible. Even with live map updates—like if a road is closed—OsmAnd can adjust and find new routes quickly. If a user has very unique routing preferences, the app can fall back to the old A* method if needed. The data for this new routing system only adds about 0.5% extra to map sizes. Users can still download just the maps they need, and the app supports frequent updates.

Some things to watch out for: all the map files you use together must be from the same update cycle for the new routing to work across borders. Also, while HH-Routing is fast for most situations, the old A* is still used for very custom or unusual routes.

Hacker News users had a lot to say about this update. Some were impressed by the technical solution, especially the clever use of border points and shortcuts to keep things fast and small. A few commenters appreciated that OsmAnd still supports deep customization, saying this is rare in modern apps.

Others pointed out that keeping map files in sync across regions could be tricky for travelers, and worried about missing a border update. Some users shared stories about slow calculations with the old routing, saying the 100x speedup will make OsmAnd much more usable for long trips. There were also questions about how the system handles live changes, like sudden road closures, and praise for the fallback to A* for edge cases.

A few developers discussed the choice of Ford-Fulkerson for finding bottlenecks, noting it’s a smart way to simplify the map. Some compared OsmAnd’s approach to other routing engines, like OSRM or GraphHopper, and liked that OsmAnd keeps everything offline and private. Others wondered if the same ideas could help bike and walking routes, or if there were plans to open-source more of the routing code.

Overall, the comments showed excitement about faster offline navigation, respect for the technical work, and some healthy skepticism about edge cases and map update coordination.

## Lidar waveforms are worth 40x128x33 words

- 原文链接: [Lidar waveforms are worth 40x128x33 words](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2025/html/Scheuble_Lidar_Waveforms_are_Worth_40x128x33_Words_ICCV_2025_paper.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47121352)

This article talks about a new way to use lidar sensors for self-driving cars. The authors show how deep learning can make lidar point clouds better by looking at raw waveforms instead of only simple peaks.

Normal lidar works by sending out a laser and waiting for it to bounce back. It records the shape of the returning signal, which is called a waveform. Standard systems look at each waveform one by one, picking out the strongest signal to know how far away something is. But this old way has problems, especially in areas with fog, shiny objects, or weak signals. It often misses details or makes mistakes in tricky conditions.

The new idea in the article is to use a transformer, a type of neural network, to look at many waveforms together. This way, the system can learn from the patterns in nearby signals, not just from one spot. The researchers trained their model with both real and fake data, including tough weather situations. Their method made point clouds more accurate. For example, they measured something called the “Chamfer distance”—a way to see how close their 3D results are to real shapes—and improved it by 20 to 32 centimeters compared to old methods. Also, their lidar worked at a longer distance: up to 17 meters farther in fog, and 14 meters farther in normal conditions.

People in the comment section had different opinions. Some were very excited, saying this could help self-driving cars see better in bad weather. Others asked about how much computing power this new system needs, since transformers usually use a lot of resources. A few worried about using neural networks for safety tasks, since they can sometimes make strange mistakes. There were questions about getting enough good training data, especially for rare weather. People also talked about how this idea might work on real car hardware, and if it could run fast enough for driving. Some users said it was a clever use of modern AI tools for classic sensor problems, while others wanted to see more open data and tests before trusting the results. Overall, readers agreed the research was interesting and could push lidar technology forward, but there are still some questions to answer before it can be used in real cars.

## Palm OS User Interface Guidelines (2003) [pdf]

- 原文链接: [Palm OS User Interface Guidelines (2003) [pdf]](https://cs.uml.edu/~fredm/courses/91.308-spr05/files/palmdocs/uiguidelines.pdf)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47168726)

This article is about the official Palm OS User Interface Guidelines from 2003. It explains how to design apps for Palm handheld devices so they are easy to use and feel like other Palm apps.

The guidelines say Palm apps should be simple, fast, and easy to use. Because Palm devices have small screens and no real keyboard, apps should not ask for much data entry. Menus are hidden by default, and toolbars with lots of buttons are not good. Instead, show only the most important buttons. Apps should show the top 20% of features people use the most. Less is more.

Palm apps must open quickly and let users get to important info in one or two taps. For example, the calendar app always shows today’s schedule when it opens. Consistency is important, so apps should look and work like built-in apps. Power user features can be hidden but easy to find. Battery life matters, so apps should not use a lot of power for things like communication or animation. Syncing with a desktop is built-in, and apps should work well with this.

The article also talks about how to design an app: set clear goals, learn about your users, write out user scenarios, then plan how the app should feel and look. Don’t just copy a desktop app onto the Palm. Instead, focus on what users really need on the go. The book gives advice on forms, controls, labels, and icons. It says to put important controls at the bottom of the screen, use bold labels, and not to clutter the screen.

In the comments, many people feel nostalgic about Palm devices and say the guidelines are still useful today. Some think Palm’s focus on simplicity made the devices successful, especially compared to early Windows handhelds, which tried to do too much. Others like how Palm cared about fast access and battery life, things that are often ignored now. A few people notice that modern apps could be better if they followed these old rules, like fewer taps to get information and less clutter on the screen. Some wish today’s mobile OS makers wrote clear guidelines like this. Others point out that simple design is hard, and many apps today are too complex. One commenter says reading these guidelines helps them remember to think about real user needs, not just adding features. A few mention how Palm’s syncing and categories were ahead of their time. There is also discussion about how the Palm user base was different—less technical, so the UI had to be extra simple. Finally, some note that while hardware is much better now, the basics of good design have not changed.

- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47169518)

This project is called "deff." It is a tool that helps you review git diffs side-by-side inside your terminal. The tool is written in Rust and shows file changes with color, scroll, and search features.

You can use deff to see changes between your branch and its upstream, or pick two points in your git history. Deff shows added and removed lines with different colors, and highlights code syntax. You can move through files using Vim keys (h, j, k, l) and scroll up, down, left, or right. It supports both keyboard and mouse, so you can also use your mouse wheel. If you want to see uncommitted changes, use --include-uncommitted. There is a search option: press "/" to search for text, then use "n" or "N" to jump to next or previous match. You can mark files as reviewed with "r," and it remembers which files you already checked. Deff has dark and light themes, and you can set your favorite with --theme. To install, just run the provided shell script, which builds it using cargo. Local builds are possible too, if you prefer. The project is open source and uses the MIT license.

In the comments, many people are happy to see a terminal diff tool with a side-by-side view. Some say they have wanted something like this for years. A few compare deff to tools like "delta," "diff-so-fancy," or "vimdiff," and discuss when to use each one. Some users like the Vim-style navigation, while others wish for Emacs keys too. A few ask if it can handle big diffs or binary files. One person points out the nice feature of marking files as reviewed, which helps with large code reviews. Some users are worried about installing Rust tools if they are not Rust developers, but others say the installer is easy if you have cargo. There are suggestions for more themes and for supporting more languages in syntax highlighting. A few people ask about Windows support, and the author says they are open to help with that. In general, most comments are positive and many are excited to try deff in their daily workflow.
