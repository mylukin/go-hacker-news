Telo MT1 is a new small electric truck made for city life and weekend trips. The main idea is to build a truck that is easy to drive and park in the city but still strong and useful for carrying things or people.

The MT1 is about the size of a MINI Cooper but can carry as much as a Toyota Tacoma. It uses new electric technology and safety features. The truck has a five-seat cab and a five-foot bed. The bed can be changed to carry big items like 4-by-8-foot plywood sheets, or you can add more seats for up to eight people. The truck is fast—it can go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in about 4 to 5 seconds. It offers up to 350 miles of range on a single charge and has a 106 kWh battery that can fast-charge from 20% to 80% in about 20 to 30 minutes. The MT1 also uses sensors and airbags for safety, and the inside is simple and comfortable with natural fabrics. There are different versions, with either two-wheel or all-wheel drive, and it can carry up to 2,000 pounds. The truck is small—152 inches long and 73 inches wide—but the bed can be made longer when needed.

Many Hacker News commenters like the idea of a small, city-friendly electric truck. Some people say it is good to see a truck that does not need to be so big. Others wonder if the truck is really safe, since it is much smaller than most trucks. Some users ask about the price and if the company can really build this truck at scale. A few people worry about the battery life and if the fast charging will hurt the battery over time. There are also comments about the design—some like the simple look, while others think it looks too plain. A user points out that having a truck this small but with a big payload is very rare. Some wonder if it will really be useful for people who need to tow heavy things. Others are excited about the flexible seating and bed, saying this makes it much more useful for families and city dwellers. A few users compare it to other electric trucks and wonder how it will compete. Some think the city focus is smart, while others worry most Americans still want bigger trucks. There are questions about repair, service, and if Telo can survive in a tough market. Overall, people are interested but also cautious about if Telo can deliver on its big promises.

## 6 Weeks of Claude Code

- 原文链接: [6 Weeks of Claude Code](https://blog.puzzmo.com/posts/2025/07/30/six-weeks-of-claude-code/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44746621)

This article is about a developer’s experience using Claude Code, an AI coding tool, for six weeks while working at Puzzmo. The author says Claude Code has changed how he thinks about writing and managing code, giving him more freedom and speed.

He explains that Claude Code lets him skip a lot of manual coding work. Instead of writing every line, he can tell the tool what he wants and then review and fix its output. This has made it much easier and faster to handle big changes, like converting codebases, updating libraries, and fixing old problems. He lists many tasks he finished alone in just over a month, things that used to take much longer or build up as “tech debt.”

The author shares that trying out ideas is now cheap and quick. He can have Claude Code write tests or explore new features, then throw them away if they’re not useful. This lets him experiment more and make better decisions. He also uses two code clones with different settings to work on several things at once.

In game development, Claude Code helps the team create and test new games faster. Designers can get a working prototype online in hours, which changes how the team decides which games to finish and release. The tool is also used during meetings to quickly try fixes for issues while people discuss them.

The author says Claude Code works best for people with some coding experience who want to try things on their own. He thinks the tool fits well with certain types of codebases—those that use common, modern tech and are not too old or huge. At Puzzmo, the business itself is a good test case for these AI tools.

He admits it’s hard to measure exactly how much faster he works now because traditional stats like “lines of code” don’t show a big jump. But the feeling of speed and the amount of finished work are much higher.

The author does not worry about using the newest AI tool all the time. He sticks with Claude Code and doesn’t chase every new trend. He points out the importance of balancing work and not letting the tool take over every part of the day.

For safety, he has tried to set limits on what Claude Code can do automatically, but sometimes just lets it run with fewer checks. He advises junior developers to use Claude Code as a learning partner—write their own code, compare it to what the AI makes, and learn from the differences.

He also talks about how side projects are now much easier to start and finish. With Claude Code, things that used to take a weekend now take just a couple of hours.

Several examples are shared, like building scripts to delete old data, adding new features to games, and making tools for puzzles. In some cases, Claude Code gets very close to what’s needed, and the author just finishes the last bit. Sometimes it struggles, especially with things requiring memory or big-picture understanding, but it’s still helpful.

He thinks Claude Code is about as good as a junior developer with lots of energy, but not much ownership or memory. As a tool for pairing, it works well if an experienced person reviews and guides the work.

In the comments, some readers are excited about the speed and freedom Claude Code brings. They see it as a big change, similar to how photography changed painting. Others worry about over-reliance on AI and the risk of not learning the basics. Some say that quality and context still matter, and that experienced engineers are needed to check and shape the results. A few point out that not all projects will benefit, especially older or more complex codebases. Some commenters ask about security and the risks of letting AI make changes without review. Others are curious if this will change hiring, with more focus on people who can manage and guide AI rather than write every line themselves. Overall, most agree that tools like Claude Code are changing programming, but people still need skill and judgment to use them well.

## Helsinki records zero traffic deaths for full year

- 原文链接: [Helsinki records zero traffic deaths for full year](https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/27539-helsinki-records-zero-traffic-deaths-for-full-year.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44736025)

Helsinki has gone a whole year with zero deaths from traffic accidents, which is a big achievement for the city. This is the first time Helsinki has reached this goal, and officials say it is because of many years of planning and changes to how people move around the city.

The city lowered most speed limits to 30 km/h, especially near schools, and made roads safer for walking and cycling. Many streets used to have higher speed limits, but now more than half are at 30 km/h. Crossings, intersections, and street layouts have been changed to protect people. Police and city workers work together more now, using speed cameras and extra patrols. Helsinki also has good public transport, so fewer people need to drive cars. Cars themselves are now safer, too.

There are fewer accidents causing injury than in the past. In the late 1980s, there were about 1,000 injuries and up to 30 deaths a year. Last year, there were only 277 injuries and no deaths. The city uses better data to plan, watching traffic and accidents closely. Helsinki tries to protect children, cyclists, and walkers with special rules.

Electric scooters can be a problem, but the city controls where people park them, how fast they go, and adds more signs. The city thanks all people—drivers, cyclists, and walkers—for being careful. This all fits into the EU’s “Vision Zero” plan, which wants no traffic deaths by 2050.

In the Hacker News comments, many people are surprised and impressed by this result. Some say it shows what cities can do if they really try to make streets safer. Others point out that lower speed limits and better street design work better than just blaming bad drivers. A few commenters ask if this could work in bigger or busier cities, or if Helsinki is special because it is smaller and has good public transport.

Some people talk about their own cities and wish for safer roads, while others are more doubtful, saying that getting drivers to slow down is hard in many places. A few even wonder if the weather in Finland, with more snow and ice, might make people drive more carefully. Others note that fewer cars in the city center and more space for walking and cycling make a big difference.

Many agree that changes like these need time and support from both leaders and the public. Some wish their local governments would copy Helsinki’s ideas, while a few warn that not all cities can or will make the same choices. Overall, most comments are positive and hopeful that more places will try to lower traffic deaths.

- 原文链接: [The Art of Multiprocessor Programming 2nd Edition Book Club](https://eatonphil.com/2025-art-of-multiprocessor-programming.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44767555)

This post shares news about a book club reading “The Art of Multiprocessor Programming, 2nd Edition.” The book covers how to build software that works well on computers with more than one processor. The post lists which chapters the club will read each week, starting from the basics and moving to topics like locks, queues, and parallel data structures. All the meetings will happen by email, not video or chat. Each week, one person sends out a short email to begin the talk, sharing their thoughts or confusion about the chapter, and others reply. The goal is for people to share their own experiences, not just repeat what the book says. Anyone can join by filling out a form, but they need a Google account to take part because the group uses Google Groups. The organizer reminds readers to get the 2nd edition, not the older 1st edition, and says you should read each chapter before its date.

In the comments, many people praise the book as a classic for learning about multicore programming and say it’s great for both students and working developers. Some mention that the book’s code examples use Java, but the ideas apply to any language. A few wish the club used a more open platform than Google Groups, since not everyone likes Google accounts. Others share tips for reading the book, like building the code examples yourself or looking up extra resources online if a chapter is hard. Some commenters recall how hard it was to learn about locks and memory models, but say group discussion helps a lot. One person notes the second edition has important updates for modern hardware and programming tools. Others ask if the club will keep discussion friendly for beginners, and the organizer says yes, all levels are welcome. A few suggest other books on similar topics, but most agree this one is the best place to start. Some worry about keeping up with the reading, but others say the weekly pace looks manageable. Overall, people seem excited and supportive about joining and learning together.

## Browser extension and local backend that automatically archives YouTube videos

- 原文链接: [Browser extension and local backend that automatically archives YouTube videos](https://github.com/andrewarrow/starchive)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44768714)

This project is about a Firefox browser extension and a local Go backend that work together to save YouTube videos when you visit them. The extension detects YouTube video pages, grabs the video ID, and sends it to the backend, which downloads the video using yt-dlp and converts it to MOV format with ffmpeg.

The backend is written in Go and runs an HTTP server on port 3009. It has two endpoints: one for health checks and another that handles POST requests to start video downloads. When a video ID comes in, the backend uses yt-dlp to download the video and ffmpeg to convert the file for better compatibility. It can also download English subtitles, but this feature is only partly working right now.

The Firefox extension has several parts. The content script checks if you are on a YouTube video page and picks out the video ID from the URL. This ID goes to the background script, which then sends it to the backend server running on your computer. There’s also a simple popup interface you can use to check or trigger downloads by hand, but most things happen automatically when you visit a video.

To get started, you need to run the backend with Go, install the Firefox extension, and then just visit any YouTube video. The backend saves downloaded videos into a data folder on your computer. The whole system depends on yt-dlp, ffmpeg, and Go.

Looking at the Hacker News comments, many people like the idea because YouTube videos can disappear or change, so keeping local copies is useful. Some users say this helps them keep archives of important talks, courses, or news videos. Others point out privacy and legal questions, since downloading videos might break YouTube’s terms of service. A few commenters worry about how much disk space big collections can use and ask about features like skipping ads, handling playlists, or choosing formats.

Some users ask if it can work with other browsers or sites, not just Firefox and YouTube. Others wonder about making the system easier to use without needing to run commands or install Go. There are questions about keeping the backend secure, so random sites can’t trigger downloads. A few people suggest possible improvements, like auto-tagging, better subtitle support, or using Docker for fast setup.

Overall, most comments are positive, saying this tool fills a real need for personal archiving. Some users share tips about yt-dlp and ffmpeg tricks, and others discuss the bigger trend of people wanting more control over the media they watch online.

## Anandtech.com now redirects to its forums

- 原文链接: [Anandtech.com now redirects to its forums](https://forums.anandtech.com/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44767433)

AnandTech’s main website now redirects everyone to its forums instead of the usual tech news and reviews. The forums are still active, with many sections for talking about hardware, software, deals, and more.

The forum is divided into many topics: CPUs, motherboards, graphics cards, memory, displays, power supplies, laptops, networking, Apple products, peripherals, computer building, consumer electronics, gaming, mobile devices, audio, TVs, software, programming, and even health and cars. People ask questions like “Is OLED worth it?”, “How to fix overheating CPUs?”, and “What’s a good laptop for remote work?” There’s also a section for hot deals and giveaways, plus off-topic chat and politics. The community is large, and threads are updated often, with both new and old members joining in. It looks like AnandTech’s core community is still talking about tech and helping each other, even though the main site content is gone. At the bottom, the site shows it’s owned by Future plc, a big media company.

In the Hacker News comments, many people are sad or worried about this change. Some say AnandTech’s reviews and news were the best for learning about CPUs and hardware in detail. Others remember reading AnandTech for years and feel like it’s the end of an era. A few users are happy the forums still work, since lots of old knowledge is stored there. Some wonder if this means AnandTech will close for good, or if it’s just a temporary move. Others blame the new owner, Future plc, for not caring about tech journalism and focusing only on ads or clicks. A few hope someone will archive the old reviews, so they are not lost forever. Some people say this is just another example of good internet sites dying after being bought by big media companies. But a few users point out that at least the forums let the community keep going, even without the main site.

## Helion begins work on Washington nuclear fusion plant

- 原文链接: [Helion begins work on Washington nuclear fusion plant](https://www.nucnet.org/news/microsoft-backed-fusion-company-begins-work-on-washington-nuclear-fusion-plant-7-4-2025)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44745067)

Helion, a company backed by Microsoft, has started building a nuclear fusion power plant in Washington state. The goal is to supply clean energy to Microsoft’s data centers by 2028 if everything goes as planned.

Helion’s new plant, called Orion, is special because it may be the first fusion power plant to connect to the electric grid. Microsoft has already signed a deal to buy up to 50 megawatts of electricity from Helion. This would help Microsoft reach its goal to be carbon negative by 2030. Helion says their seventh prototype, called Polaris, will be the first to make electricity from fusion. Earlier, their Trenta prototype reached a fuel temperature of 100 million degrees Celsius, which is the level needed for fusion to work in power plants. Helion has raised over $1 billion from investors, including Sam Altman from OpenAI, and the company is now valued at $5.4 billion. The company still needs final government permits to power up the plant, but they say they are on track. Other big companies are also interested in fusion. For example, Google signed a deal with another fusion company, Commonwealth Fusion Systems. Fusion is different from fission, which is how normal nuclear plants work. Fusion joins light atoms to make heavier atoms and releases lots of energy with less waste and no carbon emissions.

In the top Hacker News comments, some people are excited and see this as a big step forward for clean energy. They say it could change the world if fusion works as promised. Others are more doubtful, pointing out that fusion has been “almost ready” for decades but never quite delivered. Some users wonder if the 2028 date is too optimistic, since building new energy plants often takes longer than planned. There are also questions about the business deals, with people asking if Microsoft is just making a bet or if they truly believe fusion will work by then. Some are curious about the technical side and want to know how Helion’s approach is different from other fusion companies. A few commenters talk about the need for more government support and say that even if Helion is first, more fusion plants will be needed to really help with climate change. Others warn that if fusion becomes real, it could change the whole energy market and make old power plants less valuable. Overall, the comments show a mix of hope, caution, technical curiosity, and business interest.

## PixiEditor 2.0 – A FOSS universal 2D graphics editor

- 原文链接: [PixiEditor 2.0 – A FOSS universal 2D graphics editor](https://pixieditor.net/blog/2025/07/30/20-release/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44746583)

PixiEditor 2.0 is a new free and open-source tool for editing all kinds of 2D graphics, not just pixel art. The team calls it a “universal” editor because it lets you work with raster images, vectors, animations, and procedural effects all in one app. The main feature is the Node Graph, which lets you connect layers and effects in creative ways—almost like building your own mini image processing pipeline. With this, you can do things like make 3D cube textures, complex animations, or procedural effects that update live as you edit.

You can freely switch between painting, pixel art, and vector modes. Vectors are kept in their own layers, so you can always edit them later without losing quality. Tools include paths, shapes, text, and more. The Node Graph is powerful: each layer is a node, and you can link them together to create special effects or even entire workspaces with different outputs at once.

Animation is now built-in, including both classic frame-by-frame and procedural options via the node system. You can export animations as videos or sprite sheets. The pixel art tools remain strong, with things like pixel-perfect brushes and non-destructive text.

PixiEditor 2.0 also launches with a new way to support the project: paid extensions and a “Founder’s Pack.” The base editor stays free and open-source, but you can buy extras like special workspaces (for making cards, seamless textures, or reusable pixel art animations), extra palettes, and a unique app badge. This helps fund development, as the creator left a full-time job to work on PixiEditor.

The new version needs a Vulkan-compatible GPU and a 64-bit system. If your computer can’t run it, you can switch back to version 1.0 for now.

In the Hacker News comments, many people are excited to see a true open-source competitor to apps like Photoshop or Aseprite, especially for new workflows mixing vectors and raster art. Some users praise the Node Graph feature, saying it could change how people make 2D art and effects—one comment even jokes about someone running Doom inside it. Others are happy about the animation improvements, since frame-by-frame and procedural animation in one tool is rare.

A few commenters worry about the new hardware requirements, especially for people on older computers or Linux setups, but most understand it’s needed for advanced features. There is a lot of support for the funding model: people say they are glad the editor stays free, and they like the idea of buying add-ons to help the project. Some compare this to Blender’s model, where core functions are free and extras raise money.

One or two users mention they hope PixiEditor will get even more features, like vector animation and better plugin support. Others discuss the challenge of making money with open-source, and praise the honest approach from the creator. Overall, the mood is supportive, and many plan to try out the new version or recommend it to friends.
