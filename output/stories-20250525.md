## An Almost Pointless Exercise in GPU Optimization

- 原文链接: [An Almost Pointless Exercise in GPU Optimization](https://blog.speechmatics.com/pointless-gpu-optimization-exercise)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44049282)

This article talks about optimizing a GPU to run a card game called "Beggar My Neighbour". The author tried to make a pointless problem run faster on a GPU, which is usually not attempted because it’s seen as having no practical value.

The task started with a C++ program that played this card game and was then ported to run on a GPU. Moving to a GPU was simple but making it fast was not. The author learned about minimizing thread divergence and maximizing memory access speed. The program was transformed into a state machine to help threads work in sync, using different data values.

Initially, the GPU version was slower than the CPU. The author used Nvidia Nsight Compute to analyze the performance. By adjusting thread configurations, using lookup tables, and moving parts of the data to faster memory (shared memory), performance improved. The author found that compacting data structures further boosted speed, achieving 100 million deals per second, compared to 3 million on a CPU.

In the Hacker News comments, one user pointed out the "pointless" nature of the problem, referencing John Conway, who described it as not worth solving. Another commenter was curious about updates or changes since the article was published. There was interest in the algorithm's performance improvements despite the problem's theoretical insignificance, showing the community's appreciation for technical challenges and optimization.
