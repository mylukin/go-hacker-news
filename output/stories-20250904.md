Stripe has launched a new blockchain called Tempo, made just for payments with stablecoins. The idea is that most blockchains today are made for many things or are focused on trading, but not really for regular payments.

Tempo is designed to move money fast, cheaply, and reliably between people and businesses anywhere in the world. Stripe built it together with big partners like Visa, OpenAI, Shopify, and Deutsche Bank to make sure it works for real companies. The blockchain can handle over 100,000 transactions every second and promises fast results, almost right away. Fees are very low and always the same, and you can pay them in any stablecoin you like.

Tempo also has built-in privacy, so important details about payments can stay secret but still follow the rules. It is made for several uses: sending money across borders, paying people around the world, adding payments into other apps, tiny payments, payments between bots or programs, and bank transfers with instant settlement.

Some technical features are: letting you pay fees in any stablecoin, special lanes just for payments, easy swapping between different stablecoins, sending many payments at once, and tools for following rules and adding payment details. It’s also compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), so people who make apps for Ethereum can use it easily.

Tempo is open for anyone to use and build on, though right now only partners can try it. Later, anyone will be able to run validator nodes to help keep the network going.

In the comment section on Hacker News, some people are excited to see Stripe using blockchain in a serious way, especially for payments, which is something crypto has promised for years. They like that Stripe is working with big, well-known partners, which could make it more likely to get used in real businesses. Some people are worried about how “decentralized” it will be, since big companies are running it at first and will control a lot. Others point out that payments are already fast and cheap in many countries, so they wonder if this will really solve a big problem, or just add more tech for no reason.

A few commenters ask if regular people will ever use it, or if it’s just for companies. Some wonder if governments or banks will try to stop it, especially if it gets popular for moving large amounts of money. There’s also a discussion about privacy: some like that there are privacy features, while others worry it might not be private enough or might let Stripe see too much. Some users are hopeful that Tempo can finally make global payments simple, but others say that the hard parts of money movement are legal and regulatory, not technical. Overall, people are watching to see if Stripe can really make payments better using this new blockchain.

- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45131921)

This was the 49th ICPC World Finals, held in Baku in 2025, where university teams from around the world competed in solving algorithm and programming problems. The contest ended with St. Petersburg State University taking first place, solving 11 problems with a time score of 1478.

The scoreboard shows the number of problems solved and the total time for each team, with penalties for wrong submissions. The University of Tokyo and Beijing Jiaotong University also did very well, both solving 10 problems. Top teams came from Russia, Japan, and China, but universities from many other countries were in the top 50, including the US, Korea, Germany, Croatia, and Singapore.

Problems are labeled from A to L. Each team’s row shows how many problems they solved and how many tries it took for each. For example, St. Petersburg State University solved some problems on their first try but needed more attempts on others. Teams get a higher score if they solve more problems and if they do it more quickly.

Many teams solved between 6 and 9 problems, showing how hard the contest was. Only one team managed to solve 11 out of 13 problems. Even well-known universities like MIT, Harvard, and Tsinghua were behind the top team. There are also problem links, so people can see what kind of questions the teams had to answer.

From the comments, many people are impressed by the high level of skill, especially from the Russian and Chinese teams, saying their training is very strong. Some wish the contest had more diversity at the very top, not just the same top universities every year. Others point out that just getting to the finals is a huge achievement for any student or school.

A few commenters say that the contest problems are getting harder and more mathematical each year, and wonder if this is good or bad for programming education. Some share stories about their own ICPC experiences, saying it helped them get jobs or learn teamwork. Others discuss the difference between being good at contests and being a good software engineer in real life.

People also mention that the number of submissions for some teams is very high, showing they did not give up and kept trying. Some suggest that the contest format—one computer per team—makes it unique and tests communication skills. Lastly, several are happy to see universities from new regions making it to the finals, and hope this trend continues.

## Classic 8×8-pixel B&W Mac patterns

- 原文链接: [Classic 8×8-pixel B&W Mac patterns](https://www.pauladamsmith.com/blog/2025/09/classic-mac-patterns.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45131538)

This article is about a website that shares the old black-and-white 8×8-pixel patterns from classic Macintosh computers. The writer wanted to use one of these patterns in a personal project and realized it was hard to find clean, original images online.

There are 38 patterns, first seen in the 1984 Mac System 1.0. The author chose to extract them from System 6 because it’s easier to access with modern tools. They downloaded Mini vMac (a Mac emulator), old Mac ROMs, a System 6 disk image, and some extra software (ExportFl, sitPack, The Unarchiver, and Xcode tools). Using Mini vMac, they booted System 6, mounted the needed disk images, and used sitPack to copy the System file. ExportFl then helped move the file onto their modern Mac.

On the modern computer, they extracted the System file using The Unarchiver. With Xcode's DeRez tool, they pulled out the ‘PAT#’ resource, which stores the pixel patterns as bytes. The result was a text file showing the raw pattern data. They wrote a simple Python program to convert this data into .pbm files, a simple format where each '1' or '0' is a black or white pixel. This process lets anyone turn the patterns into any image type or size, using tools like ImageMagick. The author notes it’s important to use the right settings so the patterns don’t get blurry when resized.

The reason for doing all this is nostalgia. The patterns remind the author of old Mac games and software. They also wanted to avoid mistakes that might happen if they just took screenshots or drew the patterns by hand. Extracting the raw data keeps the patterns as close to the original as possible. The .pbm format is easy to use and good for archiving. The author shares a link to the project site so people can get the patterns.

In the comments, many readers say they remember these patterns and feel nostalgic too. Some talk about how the patterns were clever designs because black-and-white screens needed ways to show different textures. A few mention that extracting resources from old software can be tricky, but the author’s method is clear and helpful. Others share tips for working with old Mac emulators and disk images. Some readers ask about using these patterns in modern apps or websites, and a few suggest ways to generate similar patterns with code. A couple of people point out that the .pbm format is great for small images and teaching about bitmap graphics. There are also comments about how important small details like desktop patterns were in making early computers feel personal. Some readers wish more of these old resources were easy to find. Others thank the author for taking the time to preserve a small but fun part of computer history.

## LLM Visualization

- 原文链接: [LLM Visualization](https://bbycroft.net/llm)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45130260)

This article explains how a small language model called nano-gpt works. The model’s main job is to take a string of six letters (like “C B A B B C”) and put them in alphabetical order, making “A B B B C C”.

Each letter is called a token, and the model’s vocabulary is just A, B, and C. Each token has a number: A is 0, B is 1, and C is 2. So, the input “C B A B B C” becomes the numbers 2 1 0 1 1 2. The model processes these numbers by first turning each token into a group of 48 numbers, called an embedding. These embeddings go through layers in the model called transformers.

Inside these layers, the model uses weights (numbers that help it decide what is important) and checks how each token relates to the others. At each step, the model tries to guess what the next token should be. For the last letter in the input, the model gives the most likely next token—like “A”. You can then put this answer back into the model and keep going, so it can predict the next letter, over and over.

The article uses simple examples and a 3D view to help readers see how the numbers and weights move through the model. It is a clear, beginner-friendly way to show how even a tiny language model can learn to sort letters.

Some Hacker News readers liked how the article breaks down a complex topic into simple steps. They said the clear visuals and direct examples make it easier for people new to machine learning. Others pointed out that real language models are much bigger and do harder tasks, but starting small helps people understand the basics. A few commenters discussed how embeddings work, saying that turning tokens into number lists is key for the model to “think” about the input. Some users wished for more detail on how the model trains, while others liked that the article stays focused on the basics. One person suggested that sorting tokens is a very simple job, but it’s still useful for showing how models process data. Several readers said they would share this article with friends who want to learn about AI.

## WiFi signals can measure heart rate

- 原文链接: [WiFi signals can measure heart rate](https://news.ucsc.edu/2025/09/pulse-fi-wifi-heart-rate/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45127983)

This article explains a new system called Pulse-Fi that can measure your heart rate using only WiFi signals, without needing a smartwatch or any device on your body. Researchers at UC Santa Cruz built this system using cheap WiFi hardware and a machine learning algorithm.

Pulse-Fi works by sending out WiFi signals, which bounce around a room and get changed by anything they touch—including people. When these signals pass through a person, even small changes happen because of their heartbeat. The system’s algorithm looks for these tiny changes and filters out other noise, like someone moving or things in the room shifting.

The team tested Pulse-Fi with 118 people in different positions: sitting, standing, lying down, or walking. It worked in every position and even at a distance of up to 10 feet. The system was very accurate, with only about half a beat-per-minute of error after just five seconds. The technology uses cheap parts—ESP32 chips that cost $5–$10 and Raspberry Pis for even better results.

To train their algorithm, the researchers collected their own data, because no good dataset existed. They set up the system in a library, using an oximeter to get the real heart rate at the same time as the WiFi signals. This way, the machine could learn what WiFi changes mean a heartbeat. They also used a dataset from another team in Brazil.

The team is now working to use WiFi to measure breathing rate, which could help detect sleep apnea and other problems. Early results look good for this new use.

In the comments, people are amazed and a bit worried. Some think it’s a great way to help hospitals and people without much money, since the hardware is so cheap and easy to use. Others are excited about how this could help with elderly care—no need to remember to wear a device. Several users worry about privacy, since WiFi is everywhere and could now “see” inside your body.

A few commenters ask about possible health risks, like if extra WiFi signals could be bad for you, but others explain the system just uses normal WiFi signals, not anything stronger. Some are interested in technical details, like how the algorithm filters out noise, and they wonder if it could work in a busy home.

A couple of people are concerned about false alarms or the system being tricked by pets or moving objects, while others believe machine learning can handle these problems. Some mention similar ideas in other research, but agree this version is especially cheap and flexible.

Many agree that if privacy and security are handled well, Pulse-Fi could be very useful in the future.

## Le Chat: Custom MCP Connectors, Memories

- 原文链接: [Le Chat: Custom MCP Connectors, Memories](https://mistral.ai/news/le-chat-mcp-connectors-memories)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45125859)

This article talks about new features in Le Chat, an AI chat tool from Mistral AI. It introduces two big updates: more connectors to business tools and a new “Memories” feature.

Le Chat now has a directory of over 20 connectors that link AI chat to tools like Databricks, Snowflake, GitHub, Asana, Stripe, and more. You can use these connectors to search data, summarize information, and even take actions—like creating tasks or managing payments—right from the chat interface. If your tool isn’t listed, you can add your own custom MCP connector, so Le Chat can work with almost any system. The deployment is flexible: you can use it on your phone, in your browser, or run it on your own servers for full control.

The new Memories feature lets Le Chat remember important things from your past chats. It gives more personalized answers, remembers preferences, and can import memories from ChatGPT. You decide what is saved, what is deleted, and what stays private. Le Chat is careful not to save sensitive or unimportant data, and you stay in control at all times.

You can use all these features for free, including connectors and memories. There are examples of how connectors work together, like reading reviews in Databricks and creating follow-up tasks in Asana, or checking payments in Stripe and logging issues with Linear.

Admins can control who gets access to which connectors, keeping company data safe. Le Chat also works with any remote MCP server, so it’s easy to connect to other tools not in the main list.

The article ends with invitations to a webinar and a hackathon for users who want to learn more, try new features, or build custom connectors, and an open call for job applications.

In the comments, some people are excited about having so many connectors available for free and say it could help teams work faster. Others worry about privacy—asking if sensitive company data is really safe, especially with AI remembering things. A few developers like the idea of custom connectors but wonder how hard it is to set them up and if there’s good documentation. Some users compare Le Chat to ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, saying this tool looks more flexible for business. One person points out that having memories across chats is useful, but only if it’s easy to control and turn off. Others ask about on-prem deployment, and Mistral AI’s promise of self-hosting is seen as a big plus. A couple of readers mention the upcoming hackathon and say they’re planning to try building their own connectors.

## Action was the best 8-bit programming language

- 原文链接: [Action was the best 8-bit programming language](https://www.goto10retro.com/p/action-was-the-best-8-bit-programming)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45131243)

The article talks about Action!, a programming language made for Atari 8-bit computers in the early 1980s. The writer explains why Action! was special compared to other languages like BASIC and Assembly, which were common on 8-bit machines.

Action! was created by Clinton Parker and sold as a 16K cartridge, which included everything: a text editor, compiler, and debugger. This made it more like a modern IDE, which was rare back then. The editor could scroll lines past 40 characters, copy and paste text, and even split the screen—features not often found in 1983.

The language itself looked a bit like C or Pascal but was simpler. It only had three data types (BYTE, CARD, INT), and strings were just arrays of bytes. To end blocks, you wrote FI (for IF) or OD (for DO), which is IF and DO spelled backward. The compiler was very fast, letting you write, compile, and run programs in just seconds. This was much quicker than other languages on Atari, like Pascal or C, which were slow and needed more hardware.

However, Action! had limits. You needed the cartridge to run programs, and there was no floating-point support unless you bought add-ons. The add-ons helped, but floating-point math was still basic and missed important functions like sine and cosine. Action! was mostly used by hobbyists, with only a few commercial programs made using it.

The manual was helpful but expected you already knew programming. Today, you can find digital copies online, along with tutorials and more Action! resources for people who want to try it out on emulators or real hardware.

In the comment section, many people share good memories of Action!. Some say it was the first language that made them feel like “real” programmers because of its speed and structure. Others remember the editor as being ahead of its time. A few users wish it had been available on other computers, like the Apple II or Commodore 64.

Some commenters think BASIC was easier to learn, but Action! made bigger or faster programs possible. A few mention problems, like needing the cartridge to run programs, or the lack of floating-point math, which made certain games or math tools hard to write. Others point out that, while Action! was great for the 6502 CPU, it never became popular outside of Atari.

There are debates on how Action! compares to C or Pascal. Some say C was more powerful, but Action! was much faster and easier for Atari. A few share tips on using modern disk images and emulators to try Action! today. Some comment on how expensive the cartridge and manuals were back then, while others are glad so many resources are now free online.

One person says the lack of commercial software made in Action! was a shame, but most agree that for hobbyists, it was one of the best and most fun languages for the Atari 8-bit computers.
