Hello everyone, this is the 2026-01-01 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we bring you a mix of stories about the internet’s past and future, tech culture, open source, hardware, and the latest changes in cars and software.

First, let’s talk about the internet and how it has changed. One article looks back, saying the early web was about learning, making friends, and sharing ideas. It was full of personal websites and creative spaces. Now, the writer feels, big platforms control what we see and how we connect. The internet became more about money and attention, less about freedom. The author uses ideas from Ivan Illich, who said tools should help us be creative, but when they get too powerful, they start to control us. The article gives examples from history—like textiles, antibiotics, and space travel—to show how new tech can start good but later bring problems. For the web, this means ads everywhere, less control over our content, and weaker real connections.

The writer’s answer is to go back to personal websites—simple, hand-coded, and owned by their makers. He suggests starting small, not worrying about perfect design, and using IndieWeb tools to connect. The call is to reclaim the internet and create your own space, away from big platforms.

Hacker News readers shared many memories of early websites and small online groups. Some say the web is still creative, with tools like Mastodon and IndieWeb. Others point out big platforms help creators reach more people. There are worries about how hard it is to run a personal site, but some suggest simple blogs and easy tools can help. Many agree it’s good to “own your content,” but also warn not everyone can or wants to go back to the old web. The discussion is full of nostalgia, practical advice, and hope for a more friendly, personal internet.

Next, we have a clear and friendly article explaining how cameras and lenses work. It starts from basics: a camera records light, and different parts of the camera change how pictures look. Old cameras used film, now most use digital sensors. These sensors use tiny detectors and color filters for red, green, and blue. If you use just the sensor, the picture is messy, so you put it in a dark box with a small hole—a pinhole camera, which gives an upside-down image. Lenses are used to bend light, control focus, and make images sharp. The article explains prime and zoom lenses, aperture, f-number, and common problems like blurry edges or chromatic aberration. Real cameras have many lenses inside to fix these issues.

Readers praised the article for simple pictures, good demos, and easy explanations. Some shared stories about building pinhole cameras or learning about optics. There were discussions on how knowing about lenses can help take better photos. A few pointed out minor errors or asked for more detail, but most said the article made a hard topic clear and fun.

Now, let’s look at Linux. An article says more people who want to control their own computers should use Linux instead of Windows or Mac. Linux is free, open source, and you can change almost anything. It’s easier to install now, works with more hardware, and can run normal tasks and even many games thanks to Proton and Steam. Linux has no built-in ads or forced updates, and is safer from viruses. It can run well on old computers. The writer suggests trying Linux with a “live USB” before installing.

In the comments, many agree Linux is better for privacy and control. Some share their own switch stories. Others say Linux is still hard for new users, and hardware support can be a problem. Some love customizing, while others just want things to work out of the box. There’s debate over Linux on desktops vs servers, and some recommend Ubuntu or Mint for beginners. Many point out Linux helps you learn more about computers, but warn it isn’t always the easiest choice.

Next, we have a story where AI helped solve a 500-year-old mystery. The article tells how Gemini 3.0, an AI model, was given photos of a page in the Nuremberg Chronicle, a famous book from 1493. The page had four circles with mysterious numbers and Latin words. For centuries, no one knew what they meant. Gemini read the Latin, translated it, and explained the circles were a “date conversion table” comparing two Bible timelines for when Abraham was born: one from the Greek Old Testament, and one from the Hebrew Bible. The numbers were different because the two systems count years differently. Gemini also studied the handwriting and guessed the date and type of person who wrote it.

Hacker News readers were amazed that AI could read old handwriting and understand the logic. Some pointed out small mistakes, but praised the reasoning. There was discussion on how AI might help with other history mysteries, but also warnings about trusting AI too much. Many were excited to see AI used in digital humanities, but some wondered about AI’s limits. The mood was a mix of excitement and caution.

Now to hardware. Dell released the GB10, a mini workstation for AI developers, similar to Nvidia’s DGX Spark. The review says the GB10 fixes some problems from the DGX Spark, like adding a power LED and better cooling, but it’s very expensive—over $4,000. It uses an Arm CPU and a Blackwell GPU, shares 128GB memory, and has very fast networking. It runs Nvidia’s DGX OS based on Ubuntu, but only promises updates for 2 years. It’s good at AI developer tasks, but not meant for gaming or as a general desktop.

Commenters had mixed views. Some liked the new features and strong networking, others said the price was too high and the short support period was a problem. There was debate about real use for fast networking, and if Arm on Linux will stay well supported. Some joked about marketing claims, and most agreed it’s only for a small group of developers.

Next, a new open source tool called OpenWorkers lets you run Cloudflare Workers on your own servers using Rust. It uses V8 isolates for safe JavaScript, supports common Cloudflare features, and is easy to set up with Docker Compose. The main reasons for building it are privacy, cost control, and avoiding vendor lock-in. You can use storage and web APIs just like with Cloudflare Workers.

Comments were positive about keeping data private and avoiding vendor lock-in. Some liked the use of Rust and V8, but others asked about security and if the setup is simple enough. There were questions about performance, support for other languages, and the limits of running your own edge network. Most people liked having more open-source options for serverless computing.

Dan Wang wrote his yearly letter about Silicon Valley, China, AI, and the world. He compares the serious, humorless culture of both Silicon Valley tech leaders and the Chinese Communist Party. He says the Bay Area is more about AI now, and tech is powerful but narrow-minded. He praises the merit-based culture, but warns about groupthink and a lack of care for the wider world. He doubts AI will change the world as fast as some say, and thinks China’s tech is strong because of competition and manufacturing, not just government help. Wang says the US should learn from China’s industrial strategy and not hope for China to fail. He shares personal thoughts about his book and the value of writing.

Comments show respect for Wang’s deep knowledge but also debate. Some agree the US needs better infrastructure and manufacturing, others think Wang is too positive about China. Some say Silicon Valley is insular, others defend its openness. There’s debate about AI risks and if America can change. Many like his call for the US to learn from others, even if they disagree with his outlook.

Apple now lets iOS apps in Japan use browser engines other than WebKit, but with many rules. Developers must get permission, pass tough web and security tests, and only release the app in Japan. There are privacy and update rules, and only main browser companies can apply for in-app browsers.

Comments are mixed. Some welcome more browser choice, others think the rules are too strict and will block small makers. Some say Apple still keeps strong control, and only big companies will pass the tests. There are hopes this will spread to other countries, but many doubt how open and fair it really is. Most agree this is a small but important step, mostly due to pressure from Japanese regulators.

Another article lists important speed and memory numbers for Python. It shows how much memory Python objects use—lists, strings, integers all take more memory than many think. Using __slots__ in classes can save a lot of memory. Basic operations are very fast, dict and set lookups are much faster than lists, and f-strings are the fastest way to format strings. For JSON, orjson and msgspec are faster than the built-in json. FastAPI and similar frameworks are faster than Flask or Django for simple tasks. SQLite is faster than MongoDB for simple reads and writes.

Readers liked seeing real numbers and said it helps them write better Python. Some were surprised by memory use, others shared tips for saving RAM. There were talks about when to optimize and which tools to use. Many agreed it’s better to focus on clear code first, but knowing these numbers helps avoid mistakes.

Finally, BYD sold 4.6 million vehicles in 2025 and likely passed Tesla as the world’s top electric car maker. Sales grew 7.7% from 2024, even though BYD lowered its goal due to slower demand in China. Some commenters are impressed by BYD’s growth and say it shows Chinese companies now lead in electric cars. Others worry the market in China is slowing down, and question if BYD can keep growing. There is debate on who has better tech—BYD or Tesla—and if BYD’s cars are as good as other brands. Some talk about low prices and fairness in global markets. Many agree the car industry is changing fast due to new tech and strong competition.

That’s all for today’s episode. Thanks for joining us for this tour of the latest in software, hardware, AI, open source, and tech culture. We hope you learned something new. See you next time!
