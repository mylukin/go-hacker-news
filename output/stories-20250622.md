This post is about one person’s journey to build a real-life “exploded view” model of a mechanical watch, inspired by a famous blog post with interactive watch diagrams. The author wanted to hold a physical model where every tiny part of a watch is separated but still held in place, showing how it all fits together.

The project started with research, since most “steampunk art” or resin models found online do not arrange the real parts as they are in a working watch. The author decided to make their own, starting with larger, simpler pocket watch movements instead of modern, tiny wristwatch parts. The first idea was to use clear resin, layering it and fixing each part in place one at a time. But this approach led to problems: layers had visible seams, resin turned yellow, and bubbles got trapped. Trying to cast all layers at once was messy and hard to control.

Next, the author tried suspending each watch part with thin fishing line inside the resin. They picked fishing line because it’s almost invisible in resin, especially if it matches the resin’s refraction index. Preparing the line (making it straight in the oven), gluing tiny parts, and using tweezers was slow, careful work—similar to real watchmaking, but with glue instead of oil.

After some failed casts, the author found better ways to assemble and support the parts, using tools like a lab jack, helping hands, and careful jigs. They learned to use a vacuum chamber to remove bubbles from the resin. Early prototypes had issues with clarity, shrinkage, and misaligned parts. The author kept improving: using clear spray lacquer to seal painted parts, building better molds, and finding ways to hold everything steady.

After several tries, they made a final model using a Chinese PT5000 watch movement (a clone of the famous ETA 2824-2). Even though some paint dissolved and the cast was a bit crooked, the author was happy with the result after 2.5 years of work. They shared photos and tips, hoping for advice and feedback.

Hacker News commenters loved the project and praised the craft and patience. Some shared similar projects, like casting electronics or cameras in resin and slicing them to show the inside. Many offered tips for sanding and polishing the resin for a clearer finish, suggesting wet sanding with finer grits and using polishing compounds. Others discussed ways to make the fishing lines even less visible, like matching the resin’s refraction index or trying different materials.

Several watch fans talked about the PT5000 movement, noting its good performance and low cost, and compared it to Swiss watches. Some shared stories of learning watch repair, starting with cheap pocket watches, and pointed out how these make good practice for beginners. There was debate about whether it’s “sacrilege” to destroy working watches for art, but others saw value in making educational models or unique pieces.

A few commenters worried about the resin turning yellow over time, even with UV-stabilized products, and suggested keeping the model out of sunlight or using museum-grade UV glass. There were also practical discussions about the difficulty of suspending parts in gel-like resins and the challenges of avoiding air bubbles.

People wondered if there is a market for such models, with some saying it’s a “labor of love” that wouldn’t work as a business, while others thought collectors might pay a lot for unique pieces. Some suggested combining this with digital 3D models or making a working exploded watch as a next-level challenge.

Overall, the comments were helpful and supportive, mixing technical advice, watch lore, and a bit of humor. Many would love to own such a model, and some encouraged the author to keep experimenting and maybe try other complex watch movements in the future.

## Using Home Assistant, adguard home and an $8 smart outlet to avoid brain rot

- 原文链接: [Using Home Assistant, adguard home and an $8 smart outlet to avoid brain rot](https://www.romanklasen.com/blog/beating-brainrot-by-button/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44350002)

This article explains how the author uses Home Assistant, AdGuard Home, and a cheap smart plug to control social media use at home. The problem is that both the author and his wife have trouble moderating their time on distracting sites, but blocking these sites completely does not work for them.

The setup uses a GL.iNet router with AdGuard Home, which blocks unwanted sites across the whole network. Home Assistant is already running in their home. They add a Zigbee smart plug and set up an automation: when they press the plug’s button, it disables the AdGuard Home filter for 15 minutes. After that, the filter turns back on, and they must wait an hour before using the button again. This gives short, controlled access to social media, making it harder to binge for hours.

The article walks through the technical steps: setting up AdGuard Home on the router, adding a password to access the API, and then using Home Assistant’s automation features to control the ad-blocking filter. The automation uses a timer and variables to handle the cool-down period, making sure neither the author nor his wife can cheat and press the button again too soon. The author also mentions that, yes, it is possible to turn off Wi-Fi and use mobile data to get around the block, but this setup is a helpful step towards more mindful usage.

In the comments, some people say that short-form content like TikTok or YouTube Shorts is not always bad, and that accepting it as fun can help you naturally lose interest over time. Others worry that this kind of content is very addictive, especially for young people, and that it can take away time from other life experiences. One commenter says blocking sites with a password they do not know helped them stop endlessly scrolling.

There are questions about why the author uses a smart plug instead of a simple Zigbee button; the answer is that the plug has a button and sends an event, which works for this setup. Some users praise the GL.iNet routers for being open and flexible, and others suggest even stricter solutions, like powering off devices if someone tries to visit distracting websites. A few people point out that the system can be bypassed by turning off Wi-Fi, so it is not perfect, but it is a good experiment in self-control. Overall, the idea is seen as clever and useful, but some readers think more creative or stricter methods might be needed for people who really want to cheat the system.

## Git Notes: Git's coolest, most unloved­ feature (2022)

- 原文链接: [Git Notes: Git's coolest, most unloved­ feature (2022)](https://tylercipriani.com/blog/2022/11/19/git-notes-gits-coolest-most-unloved-feature/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44345334)

Git notes are a hidden feature in Git that let you add extra information to commits, blobs, or trees without changing the original objects. The article explains that, unlike commit messages, which are fixed once pushed, git notes can be added later to store things like code reviews, links to discussions, or test results. You can add a note to a commit with a simple command, and some projects—like the main Git project—use notes to link commits to mailing list threads. Tools like Gerrit and git-appraise use git notes for distributed code review and storing metadata offline. This can help developers see review info and test results right in their git log, without needing to visit a web interface.

The article points out that, while git notes are powerful, they are not popular. The main reasons are poor usability, lack of default support in tools like GitHub, and the fact that notes don’t show up unless you configure them to do so. The author hopes for a future where notes help make projects less dependent on external code forges and more self-contained within git itself.

Commenters on Hacker News have mixed views. Some people say git notes are only useful for special cases and see them as a “gimmick” rather than a must-have feature. A few mention using notes for tracking internal code reviews, test runs, or mapping commits to tickets, but others think this info should just go in the commit message. Many find the setup and syncing of notes between team members to be too much trouble, especially since notes aren’t pushed or fetched by default.

Several users prefer “trailers” (structured lines at the end of commit messages) or other methods for storing metadata, since these are easier to work with and show up everywhere. Some worry about what happens to notes when history gets rewritten (like with rebase or squash), but others point out that git can be configured to copy notes during these operations. There’s also debate about whether tools should keep track of comments and reviews inside git, or if that’s better handled by project management software like Jira.

A few people say they would use notes more if GitHub and other platforms supported them directly in their UI. Some think notes are forgotten simply because they are hidden and not easy to discover. Others point out that git notes are helpful for certain advanced workflows and long-term project maintenance, but admit most teams never need them. In the end, many agree that git notes are interesting, but their clunky interface and lack of support make them a “cool but unloved” feature.

## How to negotiate your salary package

- 原文链接: [How to negotiate your salary package](https://www.complexsystemspodcast.com/episodes/how-to-negotiate-your-salary-package/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44313739)

This article explains how to negotiate your salary, especially if you feel bad or nervous about asking for more money. The author, Patrick McKenzie, says most engineers and professionals do not negotiate well, but even a short, simple negotiation can make a big difference in your pay over time.

He gives clear reasons why negotiation is important. Even small raises add up to a lot of money during your career. He explains that companies expect people to negotiate; asking for more is not greedy or rude. Employers already budget for bigger costs than just your salary, so small increases are not a problem for them. The article says you should always negotiate after you already have a job offer, not before. You should never say a number first—let the company give their offer. If they push you for a number, you can politely dodge the question and keep the focus on whether you are a good fit for the job.

Patrick suggests repeating key words the company uses, showing you understand and care about what they want. He also says to do research about the company, the job, and what other people are paid. If you learn something new or special about yourself, you can use that to show your value and maybe get more pay or benefits. Salary is just one part of the deal—you can also ask for more vacation, better projects, or other perks if the company cannot increase your pay. He gives tips like using “interesting” when you hear their number, so you sound positive but not locked in. Finally, Patrick encourages everyone to always try to get a better offer, and gives resources for more negotiation help.

In the comments, many people say this advice works best if you have something special, like being a well-known engineer or having multiple job offers. Some feel that for regular workers, companies rarely move on salary, no matter what you ask. Others say your power comes from having other offers, so you can walk away if you do not like what is given. People mention that companies are often strict about pay bands and may not negotiate at all, especially for big firms or when there are many candidates.

Some commenters agree with Patrick, sharing stories of getting raises just by asking. Others say negotiation skill matters more than fame, and even regular people can get better deals if they try. A few hiring managers note some benefits, like 401(k) or health care, cannot be changed, but things like vacation or signing bonuses might be flexible. There is talk about how market changes, like AI and more layoffs, have made it harder to negotiate now than in the past. Some think the best time to negotiate is when the company urgently needs to hire. A few people say that if the salary is fixed, you can still ask for flexible hours or extra perks.

Overall, the comments show both hope and frustration: some find negotiation helpful, others feel stuck. Many agree that having other job options gives you the most power. A few say building a personal brand or being in demand can help, but it takes time and effort. The main idea is to try, do your research, and know what you want before you accept any offer.

## 2048 with only 64 bits of state

- 原文链接: [2048 with only 64 bits of state](https://github.com/izabera/bitwise-challenge-2048)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44320285)

This project shows how to play the game 2048 using only 64 bits to store the game state. It is a bash script with less than 200 lines of code, and you can play 2048 right in your terminal.

The main trick is how the board is stored. The board is a 4x4 grid, so there are 16 cells. Each cell can be empty, or have a number like 2, 4, 8, and so on up to 2048. These are all powers of 2. Since there are only a few possible values a cell can have, you can use just 4 bits for a cell. With 16 cells, that is 64 bits in total.

The script can create a new random board, or you can set a special number as a game state. This lets you share your game with a friend just by sending them a number. The script also uses some of the bits to store a random seed. This makes sure that if you start from the same state, you will get the same game each time.

Some people in the comments say the real magic is not just packing the game in 64 bits, but doing it so simply in bash. They explain how each cell does not need to store every number between 1 and 2048, just the powers of 2 or empty. Others suggest that, with careful math, you could pack the state even tighter, maybe down to 60 bits, but 64 bits is already enough for a simple number.

Someone points out that the original 2048 game lets you keep playing after 2048, but to fit into 64 bits, this version stops at 2048. Another person says you might be able to go even higher, but practical limits and the need for a random seed stop you from doing so.

A few people discuss the exact number of possible cell states, with some math about how many bits are needed. They also talk about ways to encode special board situations, and some even suggest using Unicode to make the saved game state shorter to type.

One commenter says that using this sort of encoding makes it super fast for AI code, because the whole board fits into one machine register. Others share their own projects, like an AI that uses a similar board packing trick. Finally, some people just enjoy seeing a whole game inside a small and clever bash script, and joke about how simple their own scripts are in comparison.

## There's Gold in the Hills

- 原文链接: [There's Gold in the Hills](https://longreads.com/2025/06/12/blm-land-enduring-wild-josh-jackson/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44318050)

This article tells the story of America's public lands, focusing on the Bodie Hills in California, and how gold mining has shaped both the land and its people. The author explains how the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) holds 245 million acres, much of it seen as "leftover" land, and shows that these places are actually important and beautiful.

Public lands in the U.S. are owned by everyone, but many people do not know much about them. The author was surprised by how big the BLM’s territory is and how little attention these lands get. He learned that these lands were taken from Native Americans, often by force, and that the history is painful and unfair. After settlers decided the land was not good for farming or building, it was often damaged by overgrazing and mining.

Today, BLM lands face problems like budget cuts and attempts to sell them. The article describes a trip to the Bodie Hills, where the author and his friends got stuck in their van while exploring. This place, once the site of a gold rush, is now quiet but still holds scars from mining. The story talks about how gold was taken from the land, how mining destroyed the environment, and how laws from 1872 still let companies mine with little cost and few rules for cleanup.

The Bodie Hills are home to special plants and animals, including pronghorn antelope and ancient aspen groves. The author explains that new gold mining projects could harm these lands even more. He shares stories about the Kootzaduka’a people, the original stewards, who lost their homes and way of life because of gold mining and settlers. Even today, most of the gold taken from these lands is not used for technology but for jewelry and investment, which seems wasteful.

The article ends by warning that if we only protect famous places like Yosemite, we risk losing the quieter, less-known lands that are just as important. The author reminds us that once these places are damaged, we cannot easily get them back.

In the comment section, one reader was surprised at how little people know about BLM lands and agreed that these places are often overlooked. Another pointed out that the old mining laws are a big problem and should be updated to protect the environment better. Some commenters said that they visited BLM lands before and found them peaceful, while others mentioned concerns about mining companies leaving behind pollution and not cleaning up.

A few readers felt sad about the story of Native Americans losing their land and said more people should learn this history. Others shared their own stories of getting stuck or lost on wild public lands and said it is part of the adventure. One person argued that gold mining is still important for the economy and jobs, but others replied that the jobs are temporary and the costs to nature can last forever. Some thought the government should put more money into protecting these lands, while a few worried that the public does not care enough.

Overall, the comments show both appreciation for the beauty of public lands and concern about their future. There is debate about the right balance between using natural resources and protecting wild places. Many agreed that telling stories about these lands can help people care and maybe take action to save them.

## LibRedirect – Redirects popular sites to alternative privacy-friendly frontends

- 原文链接: [LibRedirect – Redirects popular sites to alternative privacy-friendly frontends](https://libredirect.github.io)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44344246)

LibRedirect is a browser extension that sends you from big sites like YouTube, Reddit, and Twitter to other websites that are better for your privacy. Instead of using the main site, you get sent to “frontends” like Invidious for YouTube or Nitter for Twitter, which don’t track you or show as many ads. The extension supports many sites, including Instagram, TikTok, Reddit, Medium, Wikipedia, and even search and maps. For each site, it lists several alternative frontends, and you can pick which one you want to use. Some frontends are easy to use, while others need you to self-host or set up extra software. The idea is to make browsing faster, lighter, and safer, especially on slow computers or when you don’t want to see ads or trackers. LibRedirect tries to help users avoid big tech tracking, but you have to trust whoever runs the alternative site. Sometimes, these frontends go offline, get blocked, or are slow. There is no perfect solution, but this tool gives more options to users who care about privacy.

People on Hacker News have many opinions about LibRedirect. Some users like it because it helps them avoid ads and heavy pages; their old laptops run better and privacy is better than on the official sites. Others say a big problem is that many frontends go offline, are slow, or are blocked by the big sites. There’s also worry that you are just moving your data from Google or Twitter to random people who run these frontends, and you have to trust them even more because you don’t know who they are. Some suggest that self-hosting these services is safer but harder to set up. Others feel that using VPNs, browser profiles, or tools like QubesOS is better for privacy than trusting unknown frontends. A few users talk about using user scripts instead of extensions, but these can be risky or hard to code for all sites. Some people wish LibRedirect would automatically switch between working frontends when some go offline, while others mention Farside, a tool that does this but creates new privacy trade-offs. A few users are worried these kinds of extensions could one day be blocked by browsers, and some think using Firefox is better than Chrome for privacy reasons. There is also worry about frontends asking for your login or showing their own ads, making them just as risky as the main sites. One person jokes they want the opposite extension, sending them back to the original sites because they work better for them. Many agree there is no perfect solution: you must always choose who to trust, and privacy always has trade-offs.

## Show HN: Turn a paper's DOI into its full reference list (BibTeX/RIS, etc.)

- 原文链接: [Show HN: Turn a paper's DOI into its full reference list (BibTeX/RIS, etc.)](https://references.mireklzicar.com)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44349117)

This tool lets you enter a paper’s DOI and get its full reference list in formats like BibTeX or RIS. It’s helpful for people who need to quickly copy or download the references from a research paper.

The main idea is simple: you paste a DOI (which is a unique code for a published paper), and the tool fetches all the references that paper cites. You can then download these references in several formats, making it easy to add them to your own work or reference manager. The website gives example DOIs to try, so you can see how it works right away. The tool is web-based and doesn’t need any sign-up. It seems aimed at students, researchers, or anyone who writes papers and needs reference lists quickly. The process is automatic—just enter a DOI, wait a moment, and get the results. The tool likely uses public APIs to collect the reference data, meaning it depends on what’s available online from publishers or indexing services. You can choose formats like BibTeX and RIS, which are widely used in academic writing. There isn’t much information about how the tool works behind the scenes, and the website is very minimal with few extra features.

Hacker News commenters had mixed thoughts. One person said this tool is useful for quick, one-time jobs, but for regular use, a full citation manager like Zotero is better. Another commenter asked if the tool uses open-source libraries or custom methods, and suggested adding an “About” page to explain how the tool works. Someone else explained it just queries the Crossref API for metadata, so it doesn’t do complex extraction from paper PDFs. Another user confirmed this, saying the tool simply calls the Crossref API. A different commenter pointed out the tool sends queries to the OpenCitations database and DOI.org, which then redirects to Crossref or other agencies. They also shared links for more info about how these APIs work. Some people were curious about ways to clean up or improve reference data, mentioning projects like COMET and OpenAlex. Overall, many commenters liked the tool’s simplicity, but wished for more technical details or open-source options.

## Why do all browsers' user agents start with "Mozilla/"? (2008)

- 原文链接: [Why do all browsers' user agents start with "Mozilla/"? (2008)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1114254/why-do-all-browsers-user-agents-start-with-mozilla)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44349845)

This article talks about why almost all web browsers start their user agent string with “Mozilla/”. A user agent string is a bit of text that browsers send to websites to identify themselves.

In the early days of the web, Netscape Navigator was the most popular browser, and its user agent string started with “Mozilla”. Websites often checked if the user agent contained “Mozilla” to give special features or better pages to Netscape users. Other browsers wanted to get the same good treatment, so they began copying the “Mozilla/” at the start of their own user agent strings—even if they were not Mozilla-based. Over time, the user agent string became a long, mixed-up sentence with the names of many browsers and versions, all to trick websites into treating them well. This habit stuck, and now even browsers like Chrome, Safari, and Edge have “Mozilla/” at the front. The article also explains that changing this now would break many websites, because the old checks are still there. The user agent string is a funny example of how history and backwards compatibility can shape technology for a long time.

People in the comments share some interesting ideas and jokes. One person says not all browsers do this—text-only browsers like Lynx use their own name. Another person jokes that Mozilla could make money by charging a fee to browsers that use their name. Some say it is strange that this was never fixed, but others point out that changing it would cause even more trouble, because so many websites depend on these old strings. A few users mention that Opera tried to use a cleaner string, but had problems when the version number reached two digits. Others compare this to other tech problems, like why there was no Windows 9, or how other software keeps strange habits for compatibility. Some suggest that new APIs, like Sec-CH-UA, are trying to fix the problem by making browser identification more modern and clear. Many agree that backwards compatibility and fear of breaking websites is the main reason the old “Mozilla/” is still there. One user jokes about moving to even older technology standards as a solution. Overall, people see this as a funny but classic example of how the web can’t escape its past.

## We’ve had a Denisovan skull since the 1930s—only nobody knew

- 原文链接: [We’ve had a Denisovan skull since the 1930s—only nobody knew](https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/06/the-controversial-dragon-man-skull-was-a-denisovan/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44316093)

A skull found in China in the 1930s, called the Harbin skull, was recently shown to be from a Denisovan, a mysterious ancient human relative. For many years, scientists thought it was a new species named Homo longi, but new research using proteins in the bone proved it matched Denisovan DNA.

The skull is about 146,000 years old and was hidden for decades after its discovery. The finder kept it secret because of war in the area, and only gave it to scientists in 2018. In 2021, scientists first studied the skull and suggested it was our closest fossil relative, with special features different from us and Neanderthals.

The features of the skull include a wide, flat face, big eye sockets, strong brow, and large molars. The brain size was also large. Some features look old, like earlier human species, but others are more modern, like us. This mix is called a mosaic. Scientists tried to find DNA in the skull but failed, so they used proteins instead. Four proteins matched Denisovan signatures, proving its identity.

Before this, most Denisovan finds were just small bone or tooth pieces. So, the Harbin skull gives us our first good look at what a Denisovan looked like. Many other skulls and teeth found in China may also be Denisovan, but more study is needed. The discovery helps fill in the story of our ancient family, but there is still much we don’t know—like how Denisovans lived, how they moved, or what their bodies were like.

In the comments, one person compared this story to finding an old floppy disk with a mysterious label in their attic, showing how hidden history can come to light much later. Some commenters were excited about finally seeing a Denisovan face, calling it a “ghost” in our family tree now revealed. Others discussed the confusion in naming ancient human species and how hard it is to decide what counts as a new species. A few pointed out that we might already have more Denisovan bones but just haven’t realized it yet because we lack DNA or protein evidence. Some readers liked how science can use new tools, like protein markers, to solve old mysteries. Others wondered about the person who hid the skull for so long and how many other discoveries might still be hidden. A few users said this find makes them rethink what they learned in school about early humans. Some hoped for more discoveries and better ways to study ancient remains. Overall, the story sparked curiosity about our human past and how much more there is to find.
