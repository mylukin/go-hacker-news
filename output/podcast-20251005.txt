Hello everyone, this is the 2025-10-05 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have two main stories to share with you.

First, many people in the tech world are talking about leaving jobs at VC-backed companies. One person asked the community for advice about moving away from the fast and stressful life in a venture capital funded tech company. They said they are tired of always chasing growth and being pushed to do more with less. They want a job with better work-life balance and less pressure, and they wonder what other kinds of jobs or industries might be better. They also ask if the skills learned in VC-backed tech jobs are useful in other fields.

Many commenters agree that VC-backed tech jobs can burn you out quickly. Some suggest trying traditional companies, government jobs, or non-profits, where the work is often more stable and the pace is slower. Others think remote work, freelancing, or starting a small business could be good options. But there are also warnings: big companies or older industries can sometimes be boring or slow, with too many meetings and less freedom to build new things.

People agree that skills like coding, project management, and teamwork are useful almost everywhere. However, some say that if you leave a VC-backed tech job, your pay might go down, even though your work-life balance could improve. One person shared their experience moving to a government job. They said the change was positive, but the culture was very different, so it took some time to adjust.

A few people say you should not leave just because of stress. Instead, think carefully about what you really want in a job. Some recommend talking to friends or mentors who have made similar changes. There is also advice to try contract work first, so you can explore different industries before making a big move. The main idea is that there are many ways to leave VC-backed tech, but you should think about your values and goals before you decide.

Next, we celebrate the 40th anniversary of Network File System, or NFS. NFS began at Sun Microsystems in 1983, and it is still an important way for computers to share files over a network today. A new website collects documents about NFS, including design papers, technical specs, old marketing materials, and photos. This helps people learn about the history and technical details of NFS. The website divides its collection into four parts: source code and specifications, important documents, information about other similar systems, and photos from NFS’s history. Most of these items can be downloaded for free.

This site also links to all of the official RFCs for NFS, which are documents that explain how NFS works. For newer NFS information, there is a different website, but it is slow and not secure. The NFS at 40 website was made by a group of people, including some from the original NFS team, and they welcome more stories and documents.

Many people in the comments share memories of using NFS in the early days of computer networking. Some say that NFS was simple and easy to use, which helped it become popular. Others point out that the old versions of NFS had security problems and warn not to use it on the public internet. A few users remember problems with file locking and data loss, but others say that NFS is still fast and useful today, especially in trusted networks.

There are also many comments comparing NFS to other systems like SMB and AFS. People debate about which one is more reliable or better for different uses. Some say setting up NFS can be hard, but once it works, it is very stable. Others are surprised that NFS is still used after so many years and thank the original team for their work. Finally, some people ask for more stories and technical details about how NFS was created and used in real life.

That’s all for today’s episode. Thank you for listening to Hacker News Daily Podcast. We hope you enjoyed these stories and ideas. See you next time.
