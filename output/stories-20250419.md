- 原文链接: [Show HN: Goldbach Conjecture up to 4*10^18+7*10^13](https://medium.com/@jay_gridbach/grid-computing-shatters-world-record-for-goldbach-conjecture-verification-1ef3dc58a38d)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43734583)

A new project called Gridbach has set a world record in verifying the Goldbach Conjecture using grid computing. This mathematical problem, proposed in 1742, states that every even number greater than two is the sum of two prime numbers. Many mathematicians believe it's true, but no one has proved it for all even numbers yet. Hiroaki Jay Nakata extended the computational verification limit to 4 quintillion plus 70 trillion using his Gridbach system. This system uses WebAssembly and a cloud-based distributed computing approach, allowing anyone with a computer or smartphone to join the computation without logging in or installing an app.

Gridbach is inspired by SETI@home and uses a tech stack that includes high-performance WebAssembly, making it simple for users to participate. The core algorithm is open-sourced, and the system calculates prime numbers efficiently using an optimized version of the Sieve of Eratosthenes. Each computation job checks a range of numbers and takes only a few seconds on modern devices. Nakata aims to push the limits further, hoping to reach 5 quintillion.

In the comments, opinions are mixed. Some users are impressed with the project's technical aspects and the ease of participation. However, others are critical of the claim of setting a "world record," arguing that verifying a slightly larger range doesn't significantly advance mathematics. Concerns about the lack of server-side verification are also raised, as clients could potentially submit false results. Some users suggest alternative methods for verification to ensure the correctness of results. Despite these criticisms, many acknowledge the project's potential in making mathematics more accessible and engaging for the public.

## JavaScript Views, the Hard Way – A Pattern for Writing UI

- 原文链接: [JavaScript Views, the Hard Way – A Pattern for Writing UI](https://github.com/matthewp/views-the-hard-way)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43733636)

The article we're discussing today is about a GitHub project called "views-the-hard-way," which explores JavaScript views done in a challenging way. The project aims to show how to write UI without using popular frameworks, focusing on doing things manually and understanding the underlying processes.

In this project, JavaScript is used to update the UI by directly manipulating the DOM. The author suggests using setters and getters to keep the UI and data in sync, without relying on state variables. This approach challenges the common practice of using frameworks like React or Vue, which handle state and updates for you. One example given is updating a name in the UI by setting the DOM element's text content directly, instead of maintaining a separate state variable. The goal is to make updates straightforward and reduce code complexity by avoiding additional state management layers.

Now, let's dive into some opinions from the Hacker News comments. One commenter argues that skipping state variables can lead to simpler code but might not scale well in larger applications. Another commenter highlights issues with using the DOM as the sole source of truth, like limitations on types of data and potential interference from browser extensions. Some developers appreciate the approach for smaller projects, noting that it's fun, educational, and can improve performance by avoiding complex frameworks. However, others point out that managing state across many UI elements can become a headache without a structured framework, especially in larger teams or complex apps. There's also discussion about the balance between simplicity and the benefits of using established frameworks that handle these challenges more efficiently.

The article discusses how ancient irrigation systems in Peru turned deserts into fertile lands, emphasizing the role of culture in their success. Despite being one of the driest regions, this area flourished with crops like sugarcane and asparagus due to pre-Hispanic canal networks. These systems were not only technological marvels but were deeply intertwined with cultural practices that ensured their effective operation.

The article explains that the ancient societies like the Moche and Chimu created complex systems that were adaptable to both droughts and floods. These systems included sediment-trapping aqueducts and floodwater diversion canals, which worked alongside the main canals to maintain agricultural productivity. The Spanish, upon their arrival, attempted to use these systems but failed at first because they didn't understand the cultural and organizational nuances that made them work. The author argues that modern irrigation projects could benefit from studying these ancient practices, not just the technology but the cultural integration as well.

In the Hacker News comments, opinions vary. Some agree that understanding the cultural context is essential for replicating the irrigation success, while others argue that culture, although helpful, is not necessary for applying these technologies today. One commenter highlights that permaculture design shows the importance of aligning practices with cultural norms to ensure they are adopted. Another points out that while the Spanish initially failed, they eventually learned to use the irrigation systems without fully adopting the culture.

Other comments reflect on the broader implications of colonialism, with some criticizing the romanticization of indigenous practices as superior by default. There's also discussion about how past societies were more in tune with nature, which some see as a valuable lesson for modern environmental challenges. Overall, the comment section reveals a rich debate on the interplay between technology, culture, and historical narratives.

## Ocean Iron Fertilization

- 原文链接: [Ocean Iron Fertilization](https://www.whoi.edu/know-your-ocean/ocean-topics/climate-weather/ocean-based-climate-solutions/iron-fertilization/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43692878)

The article from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution discusses ocean iron fertilization, a method to combat climate change by adding iron to the ocean to stimulate phytoplankton growth. Phytoplankton are tiny plants that convert carbon dioxide into oxygen, and adding iron can create blooms that absorb CO2 and potentially reduce atmospheric carbon levels. This process mimics natural events like dust storms, which already fertilize oceans with iron-rich dust.

The idea is that small amounts of iron can trigger large phytoplankton blooms, which can remove significant amounts of carbon. Historical data shows a link between iron dust and cooler global temperatures. However, for iron fertilization to be effective, the carbon absorbed must sink to the ocean depths for long-term storage. Early experiments showed blooms, but not always effective carbon sinking. There are concerns about altering marine ecosystems and creating harmful algal blooms.

In the Hacker News comments, opinions vary. Some users recall past skepticism about iron fertilization's effectiveness and side effects, like nutrient depletion in other ocean areas. Others suggest the method is promising but risky, needing more research to understand potential impacts. One user questions if adding other nutrients could balance any negative effects. There's also debate about whether small-scale experiments are practical and if large-scale use is feasible or ethical. Some suggest alternative methods, like encouraging whale populations, which naturally fertilize oceans. Overall, the community seems divided on whether iron fertilization is a viable climate solution or a risky gamble.
