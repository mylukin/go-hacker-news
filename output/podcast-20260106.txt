Hello everyone, this is the 2026-01-06 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have stories about creative games, new AI tools, lessons from business, code search, database speed, and the future of software work. Let’s get started.

First, a classic game gets a new twist. “Spherical Snake” is a Snake game you can play online, but instead of a flat grid, the snake moves on a 3D sphere. You use arrow keys as usual, but directions change as you go around the sphere, making it both fun and tricky. The game tracks your score and has an online leaderboard. The code is open source on GitHub, and the creator says the hardest part was the math to make the snake move smoothly on the round surface.

On Hacker News, people love the creative idea and say it is challenging because you need to think differently about movement. Some discuss the math behind moving on a sphere, and others share ideas like adding 3D graphics or touch controls. One user calls it a great teaching tool for geometry. Some ask about how the snake’s body is drawn and how collision works. Many thank the creator for making it open source and easy to play. Others suggest ways to make the game smoother and even more fun.

Next, we look at a personal science experiment with oral probiotics. Someone tested BioGaia Prodentis, a Swedish probiotic, to see if it changes the bacteria in their mouth. They used Plasmidsaurus to sequence their oral microbiome before, during, and after taking the probiotic for 30 days. The main goal was to see if L. reuteri, the probiotic bacteria, would show up. It did not appear in any sample. However, S. salivarius, another probiotic, increased after the course, and Veillonella also went up, maybe as a result. The author saw big changes in mouth bacteria even over just a few days, showing how quickly things can shift.

In the comments, people are surprised that the probiotic did not appear, but some note that many probiotics do not stay in the body long. Others wonder if the timing of the samples missed a short-term effect. Some enjoy how easy and cheap it is to do this kind of testing now. A few are skeptical of probiotic claims and say companies promise too much. Others are interested in the rise of S. salivarius and suggest more research. Some agree that mouth bacteria can change quickly for many reasons. Overall, readers like the careful experiment but want more proof before making big claims about probiotics.

Now, on to cybersecurity. A new study puts AI agents against human experts in penetration testing on a real university network, with 8,000 computers and 12 subnets. The top AI, called ARTEMIS, found nine real security problems and beat nine out of ten human testers. ARTEMIS works with helper agents, sorts bugs by importance, and is much cheaper than humans—about $18 per hour versus $60. But AI still makes mistakes, like false positives, and struggles with tasks that need a computer’s graphical interface.

Hacker News readers are impressed by ARTEMIS’s results and see big potential for cheaper security checks. But many say humans are still needed for tricky and creative tasks, and to check AI’s work. Some think AI will get better and soon be even more useful, but others want to see tests on bigger networks first. A few worry AI could also be used for hacking. Most agree that teamwork between humans and AI is the future in security.

Let’s turn to business lessons for hackers. One article shares how hackers can learn from startups, money, and business, not just computers. The author explains how “shitcoins” are made for profit, showing how insiders win and most people lose. The article covers basic finance, how low interest rates make risky bets common, and how stocks and buybacks mix real value with hype. In startups, VCs push for big risky wins, often changing a company’s real purpose. The main lesson is that hackers should learn how money works to have real impact and not just be used by others. Building good companies and helping friends is true success, not just chasing high “valuations.”

Commenters find the article honest and eye-opening. Many agree with the criticism of crypto scams and VC-driven hype. Some say not all VCs are bad, but it’s important for hackers to learn business skills. There is debate about whether you really need outside investors to grow. Some readers share that hacker-led companies can give employees more ownership and focus on real value. Others share personal startup struggles. Most like the mix of hacking, business, and life advice, and feel inspired to learn more about finance.

Moving on, Laylo is looking for a Head of Growth to help musicians and event organizers reach more fans, without paid ads. The job is hands-on: you plan, experiment, make content, and help the product spread on its own. Skills needed include data tools, AI tools, and experience in growing software products. The team is fast and creative, working mostly online.

On Hacker News, people like that Laylo focuses on organic growth and fast learning. Some think working with artists and big events sounds fun but could be stressful. A few discuss pay and skills, and wonder about the company’s current growth. Some worry that AI might be used to make spammy content, while others think it will help save time. Most see it as a good role for someone who likes both marketing and product work.

Next, GeoSpy is a new AI tool that helps police find where car photos were taken, often in under 30 seconds. It uses geoestimation to guess the city or country, then geomatching to find the exact spot by comparing the photo to a huge database. The system can help find stolen cars being sold online or check if a photo is real. The latest model, SuperBolt, can locate a place down to one meter, even with poor quality photos.

Hacker News readers are impressed by the speed and accuracy, and see many uses in solving crimes. Some worry about privacy and possible misuse, asking if people could be tracked without knowing. Others discuss the cost and size of the image database, and how the system works with poor images. There are questions about mistakes and the need for humans to check the results. Some want to use it for fun, like finding where old photos were taken. Developers talk about making the system even faster in the future.

Now let’s talk about code search. Mantic.sh is a new tool made for AI agents to find code quickly on your own computer. It searches big code projects in under half a second, without reading every file or using the cloud. It looks at file names, folder paths, and metadata, and works with tools like VS Code, Cursor, and Claude. Mantic is free for open source and private use, and keeps your code safe on your machine.

People on Hacker News love the speed and local-first design. Many find searching big codebases slow with other tools, so Mantic’s fast results are exciting. Some ask how well it finds files with odd names or how it compares with smarter searches. There are questions about licensing and suggestions for more plugins and better docs. Most agree it is a great tool for developers who want fast, private code search.

We also have a story about making databases faster with io_uring, a new Linux tool for better input and output. A research team tested io_uring in real database workloads and found that it can make databases like PostgreSQL run up to 14% faster. But just swapping old code for io_uring does not always help—you often need to redesign parts of the system. Using tricks like registered buffers and passthrough I/O can help, but only if used carefully.

Commenters are excited about the speed-ups and think io_uring is the future for high-speed servers. Some warn it is new and can be hard to use right, with bugs and tricky parts. A few share their own mixed results, and others say not all apps will see big gains. There is agreement that for big, busy databases, io_uring has real promise, but it needs careful use.

Finally, we look at the new AI coding agent, Opus 4.5. The writer used to think AI could help but not replace developers. Now, with Opus 4.5, he built full apps in hours that used to take months. The AI builds working software, finds and fixes its own bugs, sets up websites, and even does backend tasks. The writer says he now writes code for AI to read, and uses AI to review and refactor code. He feels excited and sad—excited to build things so fast, but sad that his coding skills might not matter as much.

On Hacker News, many are surprised by how powerful Opus 4.5 is. Some are excited to try it, others worry about bugs, security, and if AI-made code can be trusted or maintained. There is concern about writing code only for AI and losing control. Some think AI will replace some jobs, but not all—humans will still need to check, guide, and design projects. Many see AI as a tool to help developers, making it easier to build apps quickly, but agree there are still many questions about trust and safety.

That’s all for today’s Hacker News Daily Podcast. Thanks for listening, and see you next time.
