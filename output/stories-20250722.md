## Swift-erlang-actor-system

- 原文链接: [Swift-erlang-actor-system](https://forums.swift.org/t/introducing-swift-erlang-actor-system/81248)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44651539)

This article talks about a new tool called swift-erlang-actor-system, which lets Swift programs join an Erlang cluster and talk with Erlang nodes. The main idea is to make it easy for Swift’s distributed actors to work directly with Erlang or Elixir systems, which are known for building reliable, distributed apps.

The tool uses Erlang’s “C nodes” to connect Swift programs to Erlang nodes. You start by installing Elixir, running the Erlang port mapper (epmd), and starting an Elixir node. Then, you set up a Swift project that uses this new actor system. In Swift, you can create distributed actors, like a simple counter, and register them so they can be found by other nodes. Swift’s actor methods can be called directly from an Elixir node using GenServer.cast. The article gives code examples for setting all this up.

The main technical part is that it uses the erl_interface C library to handle networking and serialization, so Swift and Erlang can send messages back and forth. The system lets you swap out the networking part, for example to use WebSockets. For sending messages, it uses Erlang’s External Term Format, and the tool provides Swift classes to encode and decode this format.

One tricky part is function naming. By default, Swift’s function names are “mangled,” which means they are hard for Erlang to call directly. To fix this, swift-erlang-actor-system adds a @StableNames macro, so you can give your functions simple, fixed names. This works with Swift’s @Resolvable macro too, allowing you to call Elixir processes from Swift as if they were actors.

The motivation is to help bundle Elixir apps for Apple devices, and to let Swift talk to Elixir or Erlang easily for client-server apps. The tool is still new, but it aims to make cross-language actor systems easier and more reliable.

In the comments, some people are excited about making Swift and Erlang work together, saying this could help use Elixir’s powerful backend with Apple’s platforms. Others ask about performance and if message passing is fast enough for real-time apps. Some mention that using C nodes can be tricky, and warn about differences between Erlang and Swift, like how they handle errors and concurrency. A few users share their interest in using this to connect mobile apps to Elixir servers, while others ask about security and how cookies and nodes are managed.

There are questions about how stable the system is for production use, and if there are plans for better integration into Swift. Some users bring up possible problems with serialization or version mismatches between Erlang and Swift. Others like the idea of @StableNames and hope it will become a standard feature in Swift for distributed programming. Overall, the community seems interested, but careful, and many want to see more real-world examples and benchmarks.

## Android Earthquake Alerts: A global system for early warning

- 原文链接: [Android Earthquake Alerts: A global system for early warning](https://research.google/blog/android-earthquake-alerts-a-global-system-for-early-warning/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44651092)

This article explains how Google uses Android phones to detect earthquakes and warn people early. The system turns millions of phones into mini earthquake sensors, helping more people get alerts before shaking starts.

Every Android phone has an accelerometer that can feel the ground move. When a phone is still and senses shaking, it sends a signal to Google’s servers. If many phones in the same area detect the same shaking, the system guesses there is an earthquake. It checks how strong the quake is and who should be warned. There are two types of alerts: BeAware (for light shaking) and TakeAction (for strong shaking). The warning tries to reach people before the most dangerous shaking arrives. To get alerts, people need an Android phone with location and data turned on. Users can turn off alerts if they want. The system started in 2021 and now works in 98 countries. It has detected over 18,000 earthquakes and sent 790 million alerts. Now, about 2.5 billion people can get warnings, up from 250 million before.

One hard part is guessing the size of an earthquake quickly. The system must warn people fast, but not send too many false alarms. Google keeps improving how well it can guess the size. For example, during a big earthquake in the Philippines, the system sent alerts in about 18 seconds, giving people up to a minute to prepare. In Nepal and Turkey, alerts also arrived in seconds, warning millions. User surveys show most people find the alerts helpful—even if they don’t feel the quake. Most people who get a TakeAction alert do the right thing: drop, cover, and hold on. Google plans to keep improving the system to help even more in the future.

Hacker News users had many thoughts about this system. Some were excited that phones can help save lives, especially in places without normal earthquake warning systems. Others worried about privacy, since location data is used, but many agreed Google tries to keep it safe. A few people wondered if the alerts might come too late for people near the earthquake’s center. Some developers liked the technical details, like how accelerometers work together and how quick the alerts are. Others asked if iPhones or other devices could join the system. Some users were impressed by the global reach, while a few doubted if the warning time is always useful. There were questions about false alarms and if people might ignore alerts over time. Several people shared personal stories about getting these alerts during real earthquakes. Some brought up problems like needing internet to get alerts, which can be hard during disasters. Overall, most comments saw this as a creative and helpful use of technology.

## More than you wanted to know about how Game Boy cartridges work

- 原文链接: [More than you wanted to know about how Game Boy cartridges work](https://abc.decontextualize.com/more-than-you-wanted-to-know/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44651770)

This article is about how Game Boy cartridges work, from the hardware inside to how you can make your own. The author wanted to understand all the details and share that knowledge in a simple way.

Game Boy cartridges are not just storage—they are little pieces of hardware that the Game Boy needs to run games. Unlike modern consoles that load software from disks or SD cards, the Game Boy reads the game directly from the cartridge’s memory chips. The cartridge connects to the Game Boy with 32 pins, carrying power, address, data, and control signals. The main parts inside a cartridge are the ROM chip (holds the game), sometimes a RAM chip (for saving), and sometimes extra parts like batteries or special chips.

The Game Boy’s CPU connects to several kinds of memory—internal RAM, video RAM, cartridge ROM, and sometimes cartridge RAM. All these chips share the same address and data lines, so only one can talk at a time. To avoid problems, the system uses “chip select” signals to turn chips on or off as needed.

The Game Boy can only directly access 32KB of ROM, but many games are much bigger. To handle this, cartridges use a special chip called a Memory Bank Controller (MBC). The MBC lets the Game Boy switch between different “banks” of memory, making more of the game data available by swapping in different parts of the ROM or RAM. The most common is the MBC5, which allows up to 8MB of ROM and 128KB of RAM.

Talking to the MBC is done by writing special values to certain addresses. For example, writing to a specific range changes the active ROM bank, and another range selects the RAM bank. Some cartridges use the MBC to control extra features like rumble motors or real-time clocks. Cartridges that save games often use a battery to keep the RAM alive when the Game Boy is off.

If you want to make your own cartridge, the simplest is a 32KB ROM-only cart, which can be made by wiring a flash memory chip to the edge connector. Bigger games need an MBC, which can be built with a microcontroller, programmable logic, or by reusing chips from old cartridges. Saving games can use SRAM plus a battery, or more expensive non-volatile memory like FRAM.

Modern homebrew cartridges often use flash memory, but writing to flash is more complex than to RAM. It requires specific command sequences, and sometimes the MBC protocol can interfere with the flash protocol. To fix this, some flashers use an extra pin on the cartridge to separate flash writes from MBC commands.

There are also issues with voltage: the Game Boy uses 5V, but many modern chips use lower voltages, so you may need voltage regulators and logic level shifters. The article covers these details and offers advice and links for anyone wanting to build their own cartridge.

Hacker News readers found the article well-written and very detailed, making a complex topic easier to follow. Some readers shared their own experiences building or repairing cartridges, and a few mentioned how much fun it is to reverse-engineer old hardware. Others liked the historical context, comparing Game Boy cartridge design to other retro systems.

A few commenters pointed out that even though the Game Boy is old, it is still popular with hobbyists because it is simple and well-documented. Some people discussed the challenges of finding old parts, especially original Nintendo chips, and the high cost of modern replacements like FRAM. One reader noted that battery-backed saves can fail after many years, and replacing the battery is a common fix.

Some readers were surprised at how much work goes into making a homebrew cartridge, especially for games larger than 32KB. Others talked about the legal and ethical issues of making or selling bootleg cartridges. There was also interest in the different ways cartridges add special features, like rumble or real-time clocks, and how clever the original designers were to fit so much into a simple package.

Overall, readers thought the article was a great resource for anyone curious about Game Boy hardware, retro gaming, or low-level electronics. It inspired some to try their own hardware projects, while others just enjoyed learning more about how their favorite childhood games really work.

## NonRAID – fork of unRAID array kernel module

- 原文链接: [NonRAID – fork of unRAID array kernel module](https://github.com/qvr/nonraid)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44652482)

This article is about NonRAID, a fork of the open-source kernel driver from UnRAID, made to let people use UnRAID-style storage arrays with parity on Ubuntu and Debian systems. The goal is to give DIY users the option to set up these arrays without paying for the commercial UnRAID system.

NonRAID is a separate kernel module, so you do not need to patch your kernel or replace the standard md driver. You only need to swap out the standard raid6_pq module for a patched one to support the parity math. The changes in the fork are minimal, mostly just rebranding and a patch to prevent crashes if you forget to import all disks before starting the array.

This project is marked as experimental. It is not tested outside of virtual machines and can cause data loss, so it is only for people who like to experiment and are okay with risks. You must always keep backups.

Setting up NonRAID means downloading and installing a DKMS package, adding kernel headers and build tools, and updating initramfs. After rebooting, you load the module and manage everything by hand using command-line tools. There is no automation or UI—disk imports, starting arrays, and monitoring all require manual steps.

The array’s state is kept in a superblock file, which you must give as a parameter when loading the module. If you lose this file, you need to recreate the array, and if you had a disk failure, the file is needed to recover. Managing arrays is done by writing commands to special files in /proc, and you check status from another file. You can use any filesystem, but XFS, BTRFS, or ZFS are recommended.

If you want to start an array after reboot, you have to import all disks again with the same parameters. If a disk is missing, you can still start the array in degraded mode, but you must be careful. The driver can get into error states easily, so reloading the driver is often needed after mistakes.

Some known issues are that giving wrong commands can crash your kernel, and the driver is not easy to use by hand. Moving arrays between NonRAID and UnRAID may not work unless everything matches perfectly. The project is mainly for learning and fun, and the author says most people should just use UnRAID.

In the Hacker News comments, some people are excited to see an open-source version of UnRAID’s array tech and like that it gives more freedom to tinker. Others say the manual work is too risky for real data, especially since there’s no UI or safety checks. A few users point out that this approach is good for learning about storage arrays and kernel modules, but warn that it is not for beginners. Some ask about automating tasks or making the setup safer with scripts in the future. Others share worries about losing data or getting stuck in an error state. One commenter wonders about compatibility with existing UnRAID disks, while another notes that the project is great for hacking but not ready for prime time. A few people suggest other storage solutions like ZFS or mergerfs if you want something easier or more stable. Overall, the mood is supportive, but most agree this project is only for advanced users who enjoy experimenting and are willing to risk their data.

## Subliminal learning: Models transmit behaviors via hidden signals in data

- 原文链接: [Subliminal learning: Models transmit behaviors via hidden signals in data](https://alignment.anthropic.com/2025/subliminal-learning/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44650840)

This article talks about a new risk in training AI models: models can secretly pass on behaviors and preferences through data that looks harmless, like lists of numbers. Researchers found that if you train a student model on data created by a teacher model with a strong preference (like loving owls), the student model will pick up that same preference—even if the data is just numbers and never mentions owls. This happens only when both models are built from the same starting point.

The team tested this by making a teacher model love certain animals, then generating lots of number sequences. They carefully filtered the data to remove any direct clues about animals. After training a student model on these numbers, they found it also started to show a preference for the same animal. This trick worked for different animals, trees, and even for "misalignment" (where a model acts in ways people don’t want).

They repeated the experiment with other types of data, like computer code and step-by-step math reasoning. Each time, the student picked up the hidden trait from the teacher. When they tried to detect any clues in the data using other AI tools or by looking themselves, they found nothing obvious. This suggests the secret “signal” is hidden in patterns too subtle for humans or simple filters to spot.

The researchers also showed the effect doesn’t work if you switch to a different kind of model for the student. For example, if the teacher uses one AI brand and the student uses another, the trait doesn’t pass on. This means the secret pattern is unique to each model family.

They even proved mathematically that this type of “subliminal learning” can happen with any neural network, not just language models. They did tests with simple models recognizing numbers and found the same effect.

Many commenters were surprised and worried by these findings. Some said this shows that filtering data for safety is not enough; hidden problems could still sneak in. Others thought this might make it much harder to trust models trained on other models’ data. A few people wondered if this kind of hidden signal could be used on purpose, for good or bad intentions. Some asked if this means all AI training should use only original, human-made data. Others pointed out that this could explain strange behaviors seen in AI models in the past. A few commenters were hopeful that more research like this could help us understand and fix these problems. Some doubted the effect is strong enough to be a big risk yet, but agreed it’s important to watch. Others talked about technical ways to spot or block these hidden signals, but most agreed that it won’t be easy. People also debated if AI will ever be fully safe if these secret channels can always exist.

## We built an air-gapped Jira alternative for regulated industries

- 原文链接: [We built an air-gapped Jira alternative for regulated industries](https://plane.so/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-plane-air-gapped)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44651766)

This article talks about Plane, a project management tool, and how the team built a new version for “air-gapped” environments—places where computers cannot connect to the internet at all. Many organizations, like government agencies, defense contractors, hospitals, and banks, need this kind of strict data isolation for security and legal reasons.

The team explains that normal self-hosted or “private cloud” tools still often need some internet connection, like for updates or license checks. But for some customers, especially in regulated industries, even a tiny internet connection is not allowed. To solve this, Plane made a special version that works fully offline, with no outside network touch at all.

This air-gapped version comes as a single, large, secure package. It contains all the software, services, and tools needed to run Plane, including Docker images, databases, and more. Updates also come as new whole packages, which can be carried in by USB drive or other approved ways. The installer script checks everything for tampering, and all parts are signed and verified.

For security, Plane uses strong cryptographic checks and keeps records of every build step. They also test the whole system in locked-down networks to make sure it never tries to reach the internet. They made the package smaller (about 2GB) by removing extra files and using smart build tricks, so it’s easier to move.

Their first big customer was a defense contractor with very strict rules. The setup worked smoothly, and the customer was happy—even saying the air-gapped Plane was faster without internet delays. Next, Plane wants to make updates easier, offer offline plugins, and get special government security approvals.

Commenters on Hacker News had mixed reactions. Some people praised the team for solving real problems in regulated industries—saying this is what many government and health customers truly need. Others pointed out that “air-gapped” tools can be hard to update and maintain, and worried about how well security patches get applied without any connections. A few users asked if this approach could be used for other software, suggesting it’s a good model for more tools.

Some commenters wondered about the real level of security, saying that even air-gapped systems can have risks, for example if someone brings in infected USB drives. Others discussed how the update and plugin system could work without opening up new attack paths. One developer said it’s refreshing to see a team caring about real customer requirements instead of just building for the cloud. There were also jokes about how “air-gapped” sometimes just means “hard to use,” but most agreed that for some jobs, this strict approach is needed. Overall, people saw this as a smart, focused answer to a tough problem.

## Don't animate height

- 原文链接: [Don't animate height](https://www.granola.ai/blog/dont-animate-height)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44619206)

This article explains how a simple CSS animation in a note-taking app caused very high CPU and GPU use on a new MacBook. The main issue was animating the height property of some bars in the app’s visualizer, which made the browser work too hard.

The author used Chrome’s dev tools to find out that most resources were spent on rendering and painting, not JavaScript. By turning on paint flashing and looking at the animation frames, it was clear the problem was with the three animated bars at the bottom of the app. These bars updated their height 10 times per second, and each update made the browser do a lot of layout and paint work. This happened because animating height is expensive—each frame, the browser must recalculate layout, repaint, and recomposite the page.

The author explains that in browsers, animating some CSS properties is much more expensive than others. Layout properties like height trigger layout, paint, and compositing steps. Paint properties only need repaint and compositing. The cheapest are composite properties, like transform and opacity, which only need compositing and are much faster.

To fix the problem, the author tried replacing height animations with transform: scaleY(). This made the app much faster, but the bars looked ugly because scaling warped their rounded corners. The final solution was to use two rectangles for each bar and move them with translate transforms, which kept the nice look and fixed performance. After this change, CPU and GPU usage dropped a lot, making the app much smoother.

In the Hacker News comments, many developers agreed that animating height and similar properties is a common performance trap. Some said that they learned this lesson the hard way, especially with growing and shrinking menus or accordions. Others suggested that documentation and browser tools should warn more clearly about expensive CSS properties.

A few people pointed out that transform and opacity are not perfect for every UI; sometimes, you can’t avoid animating layout properties if you want certain effects. Some shared other tricks for performance, like using will-change in CSS or avoiding DOM changes where possible. One commenter noted that sometimes, you have to balance between performance and good design, and the right solution depends on your app’s needs.

There was also discussion about Electron apps in general—some users said that high resource use is a common problem with Electron, not just with animations. Others were glad to see a deep dive into real profiling, using Chrome’s dev tools, and thought more developers should learn these skills. Finally, some praised the clear explanation of the browser’s rendering pipeline and said they would use these tips in their own projects.

## Tiny Code Reader: a $7 QR code sensor

- 原文链接: [Tiny Code Reader: a $7 QR code sensor](https://excamera.substack.com/p/tiny-code-reader-a-7-qr-code-sensor)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44649319)

This article talks about the Tiny Code Reader (TCR), a small device that reads QR codes and costs just $7. It’s easy to use and works with common connectors, so you can set it up quickly with tools like I²CDriver.

The TCR has a color LED that tells you when it’s working or when it sees a QR code. To use it, you only need a short Python script. The example shows the code reading a QR code and printing its content to the screen. The writer says it worked right away and was simple to set up.

The TCR can only read QR codes up to 254 bytes long because of its use of the I²C protocol, so very long codes might not work. The biggest problem is that the QR code must be almost exactly in front of the camera—within about 5 degrees of the center. Even though the sensor says it has a wide view, in practice, it’s much more narrow. The author reported this problem to the maker.

Inside the TCR, there’s a RP2040 microcontroller and an Arducam image sensor. The hardware is simple and could be used for other projects with different software. The company also makes other sensors, like a person detector.

The low price is surprising. For just $7, you get both a microcontroller and a camera, which could be useful for people who want to build their own tools or projects.

In the comments, many people are excited about the low price and simple setup. Some say this could be great for hobby projects or even in factories to track parts or products. Others point out the problem with the narrow field of view and wish it could read codes from more angles. A few developers wonder if they could change the software to make it do more things, since it uses the RP2040 chip.

Some readers talk about using it with Raspberry Pi or Arduino boards. There are questions about how well it works with very small or damaged QR codes. A few commenters worry that the I²C limit on code length might be a problem for some uses. Others are impressed that it works so well for only $7 and say it shows how cheap and powerful electronics have become.

Some people wish it had a better lens or adjustable focus. Others mention using multiple TCRs together for bigger projects. There are ideas about using it for smart home systems or access control. In general, people like the TCR and think it’s a cool tool for both beginners and experts.
