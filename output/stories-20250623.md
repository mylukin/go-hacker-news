The Vera C. Rubin Observatory just shared its first images, showing a huge, colorful view of the Virgo Cluster—a group of galaxies 55 million light-years from Earth. These images mark the start of the observatory’s 10-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time, which will collect massive amounts of data to help answer big questions about the universe.

The new image was built from over 1,100 photos, covering about 25 square degrees of sky (that’s a lot—about 100 times the size of the full moon). It shows about 10 million galaxies, which is only a tiny fraction of the 20 billion galaxies Rubin will eventually capture. The image also has bright stars from our own Milky Way and many far-away galaxies in all shapes and colors. By taking many pictures of the same area at different times and in different colors, Rubin can see faint details that other telescopes might miss. The observatory’s camera is the largest in the world at 3,200 megapixels, and it will scan the sky every night for the next decade.

Rubin will help scientists track moving things like asteroids and comets, even finding new ones that could be dangerous to Earth. It can quickly spot changes in the sky, like supernovas (exploding stars) or stars being eaten by black holes, and send alerts within 60 seconds. The observatory’s huge field of view and fast imaging make it perfect for mapping the Milky Way, tracking changes, and studying dark matter and dark energy—the things that make up most of the universe but can’t be seen directly.

The Rubin team also created a sound version of the image, turning the light and color into an interactive soundscape. This lets people experience the cosmos in a new way.

Hacker News comments offer many takes. Some users are excited by the wide view and the volume of data, saying this can give better statistics and help refine our models of the universe. Others discuss the technical challenges: moving and processing many terabytes of data each night, sending millions of alerts, and making sure small science groups can use the data. A few compare this work to that of spy satellites, noting that some data is filtered by government agencies before being shared to hide secret objects in orbit. Some users wish scientists could get the unfiltered data.

People also talk about the long timeline—it has taken many years to get Rubin working, but some have followed its progress for over a decade and are thrilled to see it finally live. There’s excitement about finding new asteroids, comets, and even objects from outside our solar system, like Oumuamua. Some say the chance of a big asteroid hitting Earth is low, but the cost of the observatory is worth it if it can help protect us. Others mention the unique patterns in the images, like the colorful diffraction spikes from bright stars, and discuss how these come from the telescope’s design.

A few comments wonder what happens to big science projects like this when funding ends, and whether they can keep running. Finally, several users are just amazed at how big and beautiful space is, with quotes from Douglas Adams reminding us how small we are compared to the universe.

## Backyard Coffee and Jazz in Kyoto

- 原文链接: [Backyard Coffee and Jazz in Kyoto](https://thedeletedscenes.substack.com/p/backyard-coffee-and-jazz-in-kyoto)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44356248)

The article tells a story about visiting a small coffee shop in Kyoto, Japan, which is built in a driveway between houses. The writer describes how these tiny, personal businesses are common in Japanese cities and how easy it seems for people to open one. The shop is small but feels cozy and special. During the day, it serves coffee, and at night, it turns into a bar. The owner carefully prepares each cup of coffee, and jazz music plays from a vintage record player. The space feels old but well cared-for, with warm lights and a welcoming atmosphere. The writer says being inside feels like stepping back in time, almost like entering a different world. They compare it to visiting a peaceful church, where you feel wonder and calm. The article suggests that such places are possible because Japan allows people to run small businesses with few rules, so anyone can try out their ideas. This makes the city more lively and gives visitors a sense of delight and connection that is often missing in bigger, more regulated Western cities. The writer believes this freedom to start small businesses helps make Japanese streets beautiful and interesting.

People in the comments share many thoughts about this. Some praise Japan’s open rules for small businesses, comparing it to strict regulations in cities like Boston or Sydney, where high costs and licenses make it hard for tiny bars or shops to survive. Others talk about how American zoning and building codes often stop these kinds of businesses, forcing places to be larger and less personal, with high costs and rules about parking. Some say this creates boring, chain-filled neighborhoods, while Japan keeps its charm with cozy, individual places. Commenters also discuss the look of these small shops, saying they feel welcoming because they are clean and cared for, not just old or run-down. They point out that signs of age can be beautiful if a place is looked after with love. There is also a debate about nature in cities—some like vines and plants growing on buildings, while others worry this can damage structures over time. Many commenters share their own experiences in Japan, remembering small bars and coffee shops with jazz music, calling them special and peaceful. Some mention similar places in Europe, but say they are harder to find and often more expensive. A few warn that relaxing rules too much could cause problems if people do not respect their neighbors. Others say Japan’s culture and national zoning laws help keep small businesses friendly and low-impact. Some worry that Western cities focus too much on property value and cars, which hurts walkable, lively neighborhoods. Overall, the comments show admiration for Japan’s approach but also discuss the challenges of copying it elsewhere, especially due to different cultures, rules, and attitudes toward small businesses.

## 2025 Iberia Blackout Report [pdf]

- 原文链接: [2025 Iberia Blackout Report [pdf]](https://media.licdn.com/dms/document/media/v2/D4D1FAQGcyyYYrelkNg/feedshare-document-pdf-analyzed/B4DZeBtlohGsAk-/0/1750227910090?e=1750896000&v=beta&t=uEftse3BPsTjdLQ3DmjoVkadhUGqf7-MfYj_6UnSS28)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44358668)

This report is about the massive blackout that happened in Spain and Portugal on April 28, 2025, when the electric grid for the whole Iberian Peninsula suddenly failed. The report explains what caused the problem, how the government responded, and what lessons were learned from the crisis.

First, many parts of the electric system were under stress for weeks before the blackout. On the day itself, the grid saw strange voltage swings and two big oscillations, which are quick changes in power and voltage. These swings made the grid unstable. Then, overvoltages (too much voltage) caused some power plants to shut down to protect themselves. This set off a chain reaction—when one plant shut down, voltage rose even more, causing more plants to disconnect. In less than a minute, almost all generation shut down, and the entire peninsula lost power. After this, teams worked quickly to restore power step by step, using “energy islands” and outside help from France and Morocco. Most homes had power back within a day.

The report says there was not a single cause, but many small problems together. There was not enough fast voltage control. Most of the electricity was coming from renewables (like solar and wind) and some nuclear, but many renewables were not able to help control grid voltage well. The rules for how renewables must work on the grid made things harder, as they can react very quickly to price changes or voltage swings, sometimes making things worse. Also, some traditional power plants that should have helped stabilize voltage did not work as expected. The market gave signals that made some plants reduce production at the wrong time, which added to the trouble.

The report also checked for cyberattacks but found no evidence that hackers caused the blackout. Still, it suggests making digital systems more secure.

Hacker News users had strong opinions about the report. Some said the real problem was not with renewables themselves, but with how the market and grid rules work. Others argued that renewables, especially solar and wind, can make the grid unstable if there is too much of them and not enough control. A few explained that traditional power plants help stabilize voltage and frequency, but renewables and batteries need more technology to do the same job. Some people pointed out that batteries can help, but only if there are enough of them with the right controls. Others noted that pumped hydro (using dams to store energy) is good, but there are not many places left to build new ones. 

Many commenters agreed the blackout was a feedback loop: voltage got too high, plants shut down, voltage rose more, and more plants shut off. Some blamed the market for not giving the right price signals to keep the grid stable. Others said subsidies for renewables make them keep running even when prices are negative, which can make things worse. A few people worried the report avoided blaming any one group or technology, and that the real technical causes were hidden behind political language. Others thought the focus on cybersecurity in the report was too much, since it was not the main problem.

Finally, some users shared that the issue is complicated and not just about renewables or batteries, but about how to control a modern grid with many fast-changing energy sources. They said better rules, better technology, and more flexible systems are needed to keep the lights on as the energy system changes.

## A Deep Dive into Solid Queue for Ruby on Rails

- 原文链接: [A Deep Dive into Solid Queue for Ruby on Rails](https://blog.appsignal.com/2025/06/18/a-deep-dive-into-solid-queue-for-ruby-on-rails.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44326382)

This article talks about Solid Queue, a tool for handling background jobs in Ruby on Rails. Solid Queue is special because it stores all jobs in your database, so you don’t need outside tools like Redis.

Solid Queue lets you schedule jobs to run in the future. It keeps scheduled jobs in a database table with a time for when to run each job. A process called the Dispatcher checks the table and runs jobs at the right time. Recurring jobs are also supported—these are jobs that run again and again, like every day at noon. You set these up in a simple config file, and Solid Queue uses another process called the Scheduler to keep track of when to run them. The system makes sure jobs don’t run more than once at the same time, even if something crashes or restarts. For jobs that need to run only a few at once (like one per user), Solid Queue uses a system called concurrency controls. This uses a “semaphore” to track how many jobs can run at once and blocks extra jobs until a slot is free. If a job crashes, there is a way to clean up old locks, so jobs don’t get stuck forever. Solid Queue works well with AppSignal, which helps you monitor jobs, see errors, and get alerts if something goes wrong. Overall, Solid Queue gives Rails users a simple, reliable way to manage background jobs without needing extra servers or services.

In the comments, one person shared a bad experience at a company where they used too many queues and made things too complex, especially when adding multi-region support. Others replied that the problem was not with Ruby itself, but with how the company made choices; bad design can happen in any language. Someone said they never saw a “queue everything” mindset in the Ruby community, and that building for many regions is a business need, not a Ruby problem. There was also talk about Ruby’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which can make people add queues or extra architecture too early. A few said that using threads and queues needs careful thought, no matter what language you use. Finally, one person commented that the older Ruby style of not caring about variable types is outdated, and better type systems now help make software development safer. Overall, the comments showed many views on queues, Ruby, and how team choices matter more than the language itself.

## Resurrecting flip phone typing as a Linux driver

- 原文链接: [Resurrecting flip phone typing as a Linux driver](https://github.com/FoxMoss/libt9)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44358944)

The article talks about bringing back flip phone typing, like T9, to modern Linux computers by making a driver. The author wants to let people use the old number-pad typing style on new devices.

T9 typing was popular on flip phones before smartphones. It let you type words by pressing each number key just once per letter, and the phone guessed the word using a dictionary. The Linux driver tries to copy this, so you can type with just a number pad, like on a TV remote or game controller. This could be nice for simple devices or when you don’t want a big keyboard. The driver can turn number presses into letters and words, using the same kind of word lists as old phones. It also tries to learn new words and guesses what you want to say. The article explains some of the technical problems, like handling word guesses, user dictionaries, and making it work with different languages. The project is open source, so anyone can help or try it. The author thinks this can help with new ideas for small-device typing, like smart TVs or watches.

Many commenters are unhappy with current TV remote typing. They find on-screen keyboards slow and frustrating. Some wish T9 was on TV remotes, saying it would be faster and easier. Others remember the good feeling of blind-typing on old phones, and how muscle memory made it easy. Some people say T9 was great for English, but not good for other languages without good word lists. A few remember turning off T9 because it did not support their language or was just confusing. Others liked being able to add custom words, while some say adaptive T9 could get errors. There are jokes about kids not knowing T9 or rotary phones. People mention that some TV remotes used to have full keyboards, but those are rare now. A few commenters talk about building new devices, like a T9 keyboard for smartwatches. Some remember how T9 was fast for simple texts, but long messages were easier on slide-out keyboards. There are also comments about how phone apps use similar number-to-name matching, and how missing features (like accents) make searching harder. Overall, people miss the speed and simplicity of T9 for quick typing on small devices.

## Fairphone 6 is switching to a new design that's even more sustainable

- 原文链接: [Fairphone 6 is switching to a new design that's even more sustainable](https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/fairphone-6-official-render-leaks-showcase-its-sustainable-design)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44356788)

Fairphone 6 is a new smartphone focused on being even more sustainable and easier to repair than past models. The article says Fairphone is changing its design so users can take out the battery with screws instead of glue, making it easier to fix or replace parts.

The phone is built so you can open it up, swap out the battery, and maybe replace other modules, helping the device last longer. Fairphone wants to reduce waste by letting people repair their own phones instead of buying new ones. The new design also tries to use materials that are fairer to workers and better for the environment. The company is known for caring about ethical sourcing and supply chains. However, some features from older phones, like the headphone jack, have been removed, which some people do not like. Fairphone phones can be more expensive than similar devices, but the company argues this higher cost supports fair labor and longer product life. The phone may not have the highest specs, but it focuses on repairability and sustainability. Fairphone also tries to provide security updates for many years, which is rare in the industry. The company has to pick certain chips (like those from Qualcomm) because it is hard for smaller brands to get the best ones. The phone is not widely available everywhere, especially in the US, and it may not work on all networks there.

People in the comments have strong opinions about the changes. Many love the idea of a phone you can fix yourself and keep for years. Some miss the days when all phones had removable batteries, headphone jacks, and microSD slots. Others say removing the headphone jack is a step backward, and believe it leads to more waste, not less. A few argue that using USB-C or wireless headphones is fine, and that most people do not use wired headphones anymore. Some users wish the phone was smaller, as they miss compact phones. Supporters think it is worth paying more for a Fairphone because it tries to be ethical and long-lasting, while critics say the specs are too low for the price. Several people complain about poor support or lack of availability in the US, while others say you can use Fairphones there if you buy from certain shops. There is debate about software updates and how long the phone will get support, with some saying five years is not enough and others pointing out new EU laws might help. Some users want better security or mainline Linux support, but others say this is hard for a small company. Many people still wish for the old rear fingerprint sensor, saying it was easier to use than Face ID or side sensors. Some say Face ID is more seamless, while others complain it fails often or is less secure. There are also comments about the trade-offs between ethical buying and practicality—some think Fairphone is not perfect, but still a step in the right direction. Overall, most agree that more repairable and sustainable phones are needed, even if the Fairphone is not perfect for everyone.

## How I use my terminal

- 原文链接: [How I use my terminal](https://jyn.dev/how-i-use-my-terminal/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44356646)

This article explains how the author uses their terminal, with a focus on combining tools like tmux, nvim, and custom scripts to make development faster and smoother. The author shares a step-by-step look at their workflow, which starts with opening Windows Terminal and quickly connecting via SSH to a remote machine using tmux.

They use zsh as their shell, which loads configuration in the background. To move around fast, they use zoxide for fuzzy directory search and ripgrep for searching files. The terminal is set up so that past grep or command output can be searched for filenames, which are highlighted and can be opened directly in nvim—even on remote servers. Navigation between files is quick, and files can be opened in the same or new nvim panes. Buffers are managed so multiple files stay open, making switching easy. The author built scripts to handle file opening, pane management, and even file references with line numbers, using Perl and shell scripts. They prefer tmux for its extensibility and session persistence, but mention plans to move to Kitty for better SSH support and less complexity.

The article also shares why this setup exists: the author found VSCode slow, especially with the vim plugin, and struggled with keybinding conflicts. They wanted an editor experience as smooth as VSCode’s ctrl-click for files, but all inside a terminal. They admit the setup is complex and fragile, but for them, the boost in speed and control is worth it.

For those interested in similar workflows without heavy scripting, the author suggests tools like fish, zoxide, fzf, and using editor features like fuzzy find, tabs, and recent files. They note that while you can get close with plugins and editor features, true flexibility comes from scripting the terminal itself.

In the discussion, many people relate to the desire for custom workflows but warn about the maintenance cost of custom setups. Some say that mastering defaults in tools like Vim or Emacs makes you productive anywhere, while others enjoy building and refining their own toolchains for personal joy and efficiency. There are debates about whether spending time on tooling really makes someone a better programmer, or if it is just a small part of being effective. Some users argue that knowing basic tools deeply is more important than having a fancy setup, while others point out that investing in your tools is like any craft—improving your environment can give a real boost, even if small.

There are also practical tips, like using minimal configs for portability, and stories about preferring simple editors like nano for quick tasks. Some comments compare the flexibility of tmux and Emacs, while others praise the value of scripting and session persistence. A few wish terminals had more structured output or better integration with modern tools like AI assistants.

Finally, several people appreciate the detailed walkthrough and say it gave them ideas for their own workflow, while some joke about the article’s lowercase writing style or the quirks of Hacker News titles. Overall, the thread shows a mix of admiration for custom terminal setups, caution about over-customizing, and a shared love for powerful, scriptable developer tools.

## I ported pigz from Unix to Windows

- 原文链接: [I ported pigz from Unix to Windows](https://blog.kowalczyk.info/article/4/how-i-ported-pigz-from-unix-to-windows.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44327204)

This article is about how someone moved the pigz compression tool from Unix to Windows. Pigz is a command-line program written for Unix, but the author wanted to make it work on Windows too.

Pigz uses pthreads for threading, which is not natively available on Windows. Luckily, someone had already made a version of pthreads that works with Windows, so the author just used that. Pigz also uses dirent.h to read folders, but again, a Windows version already existed. Some C functions are named differently in Windows, like `stat` and `fstat`, so the author fixed these with simple defines. Windows doesn’t have types like `ssize_t` and constants like `PATH_MAX`, but these were easy to add. The author put all these small changes in one file called wincompat.h. Pigz also includes some header files that only exist on Unix, so the author used special ifdefs to avoid errors when building on Windows.

For building pigz, Unix uses gcc and make. On Windows, most developers use Visual Studio, but making project files for many versions of Visual Studio is a lot of work. The author used Premake, a tool that writes one file and then generates all the needed Visual Studio files. This made the build process much easier.

The author says that the port was not too hard because many people already made Windows versions of the hard Unix parts. Premake also saved a lot of time.

In the comments, one person says they also ported code using pthreads to Windows, but instead of using a big pthreads library, they only needed around 200 lines of code for their use case. Another commenter points out that memory functions like VirtualAlloc can fail if the pagefile is growing, and Firefox had to add retries for this. People also discuss how pigz can use all CPU cores and that it is very satisfying to watch on big servers. Some note that the post is old, but others say the port is still updated.

There is a discussion about build tools. Some like Premake for its simplicity, but others mention tools like Xmake and Meson as good alternatives. A few people point out that some build tools don't work well in offline or airgapped systems. There's also a comment saying pigz is most useful on a single-user desktop, but others explain it works well for server backups during low load times. Another commenter talks about using parallelism in Unix with pipes or xargs, and how this helps when you can split work into smaller parts. Finally, someone gives a link to the pigz repository for anyone who wants to see the code.

## FICO to incorporate buy-now-pay-later loans into credit scores

- 原文链接: [FICO to incorporate buy-now-pay-later loans into credit scores](https://www.axios.com/2025/06/23/fico-credit-scores-bnpl-buy-now-pay-later)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44361494)

FICO will start using buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) loans to help decide people’s credit scores. Many Americans use BNPL to buy things, but these loans were not included in credit scores before, so scores did not show the full picture of a person’s debt or payment habits. FICO is now making two new credit scores that look at BNPL data. These new scores will help lenders see how people pay off BNPL loans and if they are good at paying on time. FICO says this will make credit scores more accurate and fair. A study with Affirm, a BNPL company, showed that most people with five or more BNPL loans would see their scores go up, or not change. Still, some people are worried. The Federal Reserve said more people are paying BNPL loans late each year, which could hurt scores. Affirm started sharing data about short BNPL loans with Experian, a credit agency, but these loans were not part of credit scores until now. Some industry leaders say the change is good, because it rewards people who use BNPL loans carefully and pay on time.

People in the Hacker News comments had different ideas. One person said it made sense, because BNPL was not counted before, which was like a loophole. Now, the true debt and payment habits will show up in credit scores. Another user worried that credit scores will go down, because some people use BNPL too much or pay late. Some think this move will help lenders see risks better, while others worry it might hurt people who did not understand BNPL could affect their score. Overall, the comments showed both hope and concern: some users want credit scores to be more honest, but others fear many people will get worse scores. The discussion also showed that people are still learning how BNPL and credit scores work together. Some see this as a fair update, while others think it might have bad effects for borrowers who are struggling.
