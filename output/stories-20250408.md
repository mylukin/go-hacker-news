Brazil's government-run payment system, Pix, has become the most popular way to pay in the country. It started in 2020 and quickly replaced cash and cards because it's fast, free, and easy to use. By 2024, people made 63 billion transactions with it. You can pay using someone's ID, phone number, or QR code, and the money moves instantly.

Pix is very convenient and works for both small and large payments. Even taxis and homeless people use it. However, some people worry that it gives the central bank too much power and control over financial transactions. There are also concerns about privacy since each payment is tied to real identities.

In the comments, some people love Pix and say it's very reliable and fast. Others worry about privacy and government control. There's a debate about whether cryptocurrencies can compete with Pix, especially since Pix doesn't work internationally. Some believe that Pix shows how government-run systems can be effective, while others prefer private companies to handle payments to avoid too much government power. There's also discussion about whether Pix could work outside Brazil, and if similar systems in other countries could connect with each other.

- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43617493)

The article explains a feature in GitHub Actions where you can set any program as a shell to run commands. Usually, GitHub uses default shells like `bash` for Linux and macOS or `pwsh` for Windows. But you can specify any executable in the `$PATH` as a shell. This means you can run scripts using unusual languages, like C, by setting up the environment to compile and run C code within the workflow.

For example, you can use the Tiny C Compiler (tcc) to compile and run a C script directly in your GitHub Actions workflow. Additionally, you can create a fake shell by manipulating the `$PATH`, although this raises some security questions. The article notes that this might not be a major security concern since there are already many ways files can trigger execution in GitHub Actions. However, it is surprising that GitHub doesn't lock these "well-known" shell paths.

In the Hacker News comments, users shared their experiences and concerns. One user noted that using the `-x` flag with `bash` in GitHub Actions helps with debugging by printing each command. Another user pointed out that using `pipefail` can cause a step to fail silently, leaving no error message. Some users suggested using external scripts for most logic to avoid the complexity of YAML in GitHub Actions. Another commenter mentioned using a centralized approach for workflows to maintain consistency across projects.

Some users debated the merits of using YAML for CI/CD workflows, with some preferring to move logic into scripts or use tools like Terraform for configuration. Others highlighted the benefits of GitHub Actions, such as running jobs on multiple platforms and integrating with GitHub's API. The discussion also touched on using GitHub's caching mechanisms and the potential for security risks if not managed carefully. Overall, the comments reflected a mix of creativity, caution, and critique regarding the flexibility and security of GitHub Actions.

- 原文链接: [Deleting multiplayer from the Unreal engine can save memory](https://larstofus.com/2025/04/05/how-deleting-multiplayer-from-the-engine-can-save-memory/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43600363)

The article talks about saving memory in Unreal Engine by removing multiplayer features. The author appreciates Unreal's deep multiplayer integration, which makes it easy to use, unlike Unity, where extra plugins are needed. However, even for single-player games, some multiplayer data is still stored, though it generally doesn't impact performance. The author found specific multiplayer data taking significant memory space, which could be optimized out for single-player games. After analyzing and removing unneeded data, they reduced the memory footprint by 328 bytes per actor, and potentially 392 bytes with additional component optimizations. This can save up to 10 MB in large levels with many actors. Despite the potential savings, the author argues it's not worth the effort for most projects, as there are easier ways to optimize memory.

In the comments, developers discuss similar experiences, like on the game ABZÛ, where multiplayer features were removed to save memory and improve performance. Some users explain technical concepts like "ghost reads," which occur when unnecessary data is fetched into memory, reducing efficiency. Others point out that shrinking data structures can improve cache use and performance. However, many agree that for most games, the memory savings from removing multiplayer features may not justify the effort. Some argue that removing just a few textures could save more memory than this optimization. The discussion also touches on game development challenges, like balancing feature sets and performance, with insights into how big studios prioritize these aspects differently.

- 原文链接: [Intelligence Evolved at Least Twice in Vertebrate Animals](https://www.quantamagazine.org/intelligence-evolved-at-least-twice-in-vertebrate-animals-20250407/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43619548)

The article discusses the evolution of intelligence in vertebrate animals, specifically in birds and mammals, suggesting that complex brains developed independently in these groups. This challenges the idea that intelligence evolved only once from a common ancestor, instead proposing that birds and mammals separately developed similar neural circuits, despite having different brain structures.

The research highlights that birds, with their small brains, can show intelligence comparable to mammals, like chimps, who have much larger brains. This was surprising because birds lack a neocortex, a brain structure associated with intelligence in mammals. Instead, birds have a different brain region called the dorsal ventricular ridge (DVR), which functions similarly. The studies used modern techniques like single-cell RNA sequencing to show that while the brain circuits of birds and mammals look similar, they develop differently, supporting the idea of independent evolution.

Comments from the Hacker News community offered various perspectives. Some users focused on how birds' social interactions might drive their intelligence, pointing out behaviors like deception and planning. Others discussed the broader implications, such as what this means for understanding intelligence evolution and its occurrence in other animals like octopuses. A few commenters debated the role of visual processing and environmental factors in the development of intelligence. There were also discussions about the potential to artificially select for intelligence in animals like parrots and the ethical considerations involved. Overall, the comments reflected a mix of curiosity about the findings and broader philosophical questions about intelligence and evolution.

## Neural Graffiti – Liquid Memory Layer for LLMs

- 原文链接: [Neural Graffiti – Liquid Memory Layer for LLMs](https://github.com/babycommando/neuralgraffiti)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43618339)

The article introduces "Neural Graffiti," a new technique for modifying large language models (LLMs) by adding a "liquid memory layer." This method involves using a "Spray Layer" inspired by graffiti art and the brain's neuroplasticity to change a model's behavior without retraining it. The idea is to inject memory traces into the model’s final stages, influencing how it relates words and concepts over time.

Instead of fine-tuning the whole model, Neural Graffiti affects the vector embeddings, subtly altering the model’s output. This approach doesn't guarantee specific word outputs but influences the model’s perception by building internal memory. For example, if the model is told multiple times that you love dogs, it will start to lean toward dog-related concepts in its responses over time. The technique aims to create AI models with more personality and curiosity by emulating some aspects of human-like memory.

In the comment section, users have mixed reactions. Some express skepticism, noting that the technique might not significantly change how a model thinks, as it only affects the last hidden layer. They compare it to control vectors, suggesting it's not a new concept. Others mention that the method might result in random personality traits due to its starting random weights. Some users tried the demo but didn't notice significant changes in the model's responses, questioning the effectiveness of the approach.

There's a broader discussion on the trend of AI models becoming more sycophantic, as users find that AI like ChatGPT has started to overly praise or compliment them. Some users are annoyed by this behavior, while others see it as a strategy to increase user engagement. Overall, the community is curious but cautious about Neural Graffiti's potential, with some questioning its practicality and effectiveness without more evidence or benchmarks.

- 原文链接: ['Exploding' Tunnock's teacakes cleared by tests to fly again](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20x5x0g3kqo)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43592116)

The article is about Tunnock's teacakes, a popular Scottish treat, which were once banned from RAF flights due to a marshmallow explosion in a cockpit 60 years ago. Recently, these teacakes have been cleared for flight again after the RAF Centre of Aerospace Medicine conducted tests showing they do not pose a risk.

In 1965, RAF crewmen loved these chocolate-covered treats, but a mishap led to a sticky mess when they were left unwrapped and a depressurizing switch was pulled. Now, after tests in an altitude chamber, it's been confirmed that while the marshmallow expands and chocolate cracks under pressure, they don't explode. This means they are safe to take on flights again. The advice for pilots is to keep them frozen and wrapped until consumed. Fergus Loudon from Tunnock’s expressed relief that pilots can enjoy them without worry.

In the comment section, some users joked about the timing, noting the original news source was published on April 1st, hinting at a possible April Fool’s joke. Others shared their love for the treats, with some saying they can't resist eating them quickly. There were also comparisons to similar snacks in other countries. A few commenters had practical discussions about the effects of altitude on snacks, sharing personal experiences with food expanding on flights. Some questioned if the article was a clever marketing move, while others were just happy to know the teacakes are safe for flights now.
