Hello everyone, this is the 2025-12-07 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have a wide range of stories: from fighter jet coding rules, the limits of AI in web design, why software estimates are so hard, Google's research on long-term AI memory, dollar store price tricks, a Scala migration surprise, a simple guide to the Fourier Transform, creative dice games, home science with a magnetometer, and a look inside the NSA's XKeyscore surveillance system. Let’s get started.

First, we look at the strict C++ coding standards used in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. Because the code runs on a fighter jet, the rules are extremely strict to make sure software is safe, reliable, and easy to maintain. The standards take ideas from other safety-critical fields, like the car and aviation industries. There are rules about code length, naming, which C++ features you can use, and which you must avoid. For example, each function must be under 200 lines and not too complex. Features like unions, bit-fields, and some standard libraries are forbidden. All variables must be initialized before use, and things that depend on the compiler or OS should be avoided to keep code portable. Classes and templates have special rules for safety. Naming is also strict: classes start with uppercase, variables are lowercase, and acronyms are all uppercase. Useful comments are required, but not ones that just repeat the code. There are more rules for pointers, avoiding hidden bugs, and making sure resources are freed correctly. If someone wants to break a rule, they need special approval and must document it.

Hacker News readers found the document very detailed and strict, but agreed it makes sense for jet software. Some said these rules would be too much for most projects, but are needed for safety. Others joked that so many C++ features are banned, it feels like writing C with a bit of C++. Some liked the clear naming and structure. There was talk about avoiding unsafe features, and some thought it is sad that C++ needs so many rules to be safe. A few pointed out that newer C++ is safer, but big projects move slowly and keep old rules. People wondered if the rules are auto-checked, and guessed there are tools to help. Overall, most respected the effort, even if they would not want to work with so many limits themselves.

Next, we have a story about using Claude, an AI, to rebuild the famous 1996 Space Jam website using only a screenshot and the original image files. The goal was to make a perfect copy, but no matter what the writer tried, Claude could not match the exact look. The main problem was placing the planets and labels in the same spots, using exact pixel coordinates. The writer gave Claude screenshots, grids, and even scripts to help, but the results were always off. Sometimes, Claude sounded sure he got it right, but the layout still didn’t match.

The writer thinks this is because Claude “sees” images in big blocks, not as single pixels. Even with zoomed-in images, the details did not get better. Breaking the problem into parts did not help either. In the end, the writer gave up—the Space Jam site remains unbeaten.

Commenters agreed this is a tough challenge and shows the limits of today’s AI for pixel-perfect work. Some said humans use special tools for this, and AI just is not built for it yet. Others pointed out that Claude’s vision system is for recognizing objects, not measuring. Some said this shows the value of old, hand-made web pages, and a few joked that maybe AI just needs better prompts. There was also talk about how hard it is to save digital history. Some readers hoped that breaking the task up or using other AI might help, but most agreed this is a hard job for AI right now.

Now, let’s talk about why software estimates are so hard for both developers and product owners. Product owners need estimates to plan features and releases, but developers don’t like giving them since they often feel like pure guesses. When things go wrong—like hidden technical debt or old, messy code—a “two-day” task can turn into two weeks.

A big issue is that estimates often turn into strict deadlines. When deadlines are missed, trust drops and developers start padding their numbers, which makes things worse. The real problem is setting the right expectations. Sometimes companies promise features before work even starts, which puts pressure on everyone. The writer says it would be better to let developers work at a steady pace, but knows business needs can make this hard.

In the comments, some agreed that estimates are needed, but good communication helps a lot. Others said software is always unpredictable and suggested smaller, regular releases. Some shared stories where estimates were used against them, causing stress. Product owners said they understand the pain, but still need to plan. There were ideas like using range estimates or “story points” instead of days. A few developers refuse to estimate, but others said this is not realistic. One person said technical debt should be tracked openly. Most agreed that no process is perfect, but more trust and honesty helps everyone.

Turning to AI research, Google has shared work on Titans and MIRAS, two ideas to give AI better long-term memory. Usual AI models, like transformers, are good at short-term memory but struggle with long-term tasks. Titans is a new architecture that mixes the speed of older RNNs with the memory of transformers, using a neural network as its memory. MIRAS is the theory behind Titans, helping design memory systems that are flexible.

A special feature in Titans is the “surprise metric”—the AI pays more attention to things that are unexpected, helping it remember important data and forget less useful things. It can handle sequences with over 2 million words, much more than older models. In tests, Titans and similar models beat others on long-document and reasoning tasks. Having a “deeper” memory, with more layers, gave better results.

Hacker News readers were excited about the progress. Some asked if this will help AI remember conversations or user preferences. Others worried about privacy—AI could remember personal data too long. There were questions about open sourcing, and debate about how soon this will reach real products. Some liked the technical move to flexible memory, while others wanted more real-world examples. There was also talk about making memory more human-like—remembering only surprising or important things—which could be both helpful and harder to control. Most saw this as a big step forward, but want more tests and real uses.

Our next story looks at dollar stores like Family Dollar and Dollar General, which often charge more at the register than the shelf price. Inspections found many items ringing up higher, sometimes much higher, than the price shown. This happens most in low-income areas, and many stores are repeat offenders. The fines are small, so stores have little reason to fix the problem. Some states do not check prices at all.

The main cause is that register prices update automatically, but shelf tags must be changed by hand—and these stores do not have enough staff. Many customers do not notice, or cannot do anything if the cashier refuses to help. Some stores show fake sales, making it look like there’s a discount when there isn’t. For many people, especially those with low incomes, these overcharges add up and hurt a lot.

In the comments, some were angry at the stores for taking advantage of poor customers. Others pointed out that updating tags is a lot of work with not enough staff. Some said shoppers need to pay more attention, but others replied that not everyone can, especially seniors or parents with children. There was debate about whether stronger laws or bigger fines would help, and some suggested technology like electronic shelf tags, though this may be too costly. Some shared stories of being overcharged, and many agreed that even small amounts add up, especially for families. Some thought the issue is part of the business model, while others said it is just bad management. Most agreed that for many shoppers, there is no other choice.

Now, on to a story about migrating a service from Scala 2.13 to Scala 3 and finding an unexpected slowdown. The team updated code and dependencies, fixed syntax, and everything seemed fine at first. But after a few hours in production, Kafka lag showed the service was much slower, even though data volume was normal. Rolling back to Scala 2.13 fixed it.

Load testing did not show the problem at first, until they used more varied data. After checking major libraries one by one and still not finding the cause, they profiled the CPU and found that a library called quicklens was using a lot of CPU in Scala 3, but not in Scala 2.13. Updating quicklens fixed the problem.

Commenters agreed that library changes can cause hidden problems when upgrading languages. Some said this is a common story—everything looks fine until real workloads hit. Others said every big migration should include careful load testing. Some were surprised that a small library could have such a big effect. A few shared similar stories, and others said to keep dependencies simple and up to date. There were calls for better help from the Scala team for library authors. Most agreed: passing all tests does not mean you are safe—real-world use is always different.

Next, we have an article that explains the Fourier Transform using simple ideas. The main idea is that the Fourier Transform helps you find the “recipe” behind a signal, much like finding the ingredients in a smoothie. Each filter pulls out one “ingredient”—that is, one cycle with a certain speed, size, and phase. By adding up all these cycles, you can rebuild any signal.

This is useful because the list of cycles is easier to study or change than the original signal. For example, in sound, you can boost bass or treble; in images, you can keep only important parts to save space. The article uses examples and analogies, not hard math, to build intuition. It explains that cycles are just circles moving at different speeds, and you can add them up to rebuild even sharp spikes.

In the comments, people praised the article for making a hard topic easy. Some said the smoothie idea made it “click” for them. Others liked focusing on cycles, not just sine waves. A few shared other resources or wished for more code examples, but most found this a good starting point for understanding the Fourier Transform.

Let’s move on to a clever way two people can simulate rolling a six-sided die with no tools. Both people pick a number from 0 to 11, like clock hours. The distance between the numbers on the clock face is then mapped to a die roll: distances of 1 to 5 become rolls 1 to 5, and 0 or 6 become 6. The author checked the fairness with a computer and found each outcome happens about one-sixth of the time.

This trick works best if both people want different results, to keep it fair. It’s not perfect, but it is a fun way to play dice games when you have nothing else.

In the comments, people liked the creativity. Some said humans are bad at picking random numbers, so fairness could suffer if someone tries to trick the system. A few suggested other methods, like using coin flips. Some discussed the math and agreed the method is fair if both are honest. It’s a fun party trick or a way to pass time, but not for serious games.

Next, we have a story about building a simple magnetometer at home using seasoning bottles and wire. This device lets you “hear” the sound of protons spinning in water, which tells you the strength of Earth’s magnetic field. The project uses two plastic bottles, wire, some simple electronic parts, and water. You wrap wire around the bottles, fill them with water, and use both coils to cancel out electrical noise. The circuit lines up the spins of the protons, then listens for the weak signal as the protons relax. The frequency you hear in headphones tells you the local magnetic field.

One commenter pointed out a small error in the circuit diagram and helped others fix it. Another shared tips on reducing electrical noise, like using ferrite beads, so the device can work indoors. Others enjoyed the hands-on science and discussed possible upgrades. Many found it a fun and educational project.

Finally, we look at XKeyscore, a secret NSA program for searching and analyzing global internet data, revealed by Edward Snowden. XKeyscore can collect emails, web traffic, chats, and more from almost anyone. Snowden and journalist Glenn Greenwald say analysts can read emails, see browsing history, and track people by username or keywords, often without a court order. The NSA says access is controlled and only for foreign intelligence, with checks to prevent abuse.

XKeyscore gathers data from many sites worldwide, using servers and databases on Linux, Red Hat, Apache, and MySQL. It gets data from satellites, cables, and hacking, storing most data for only a few days. Analysts can search by keywords, languages, or behaviors, making it easy to find people using privacy tools or visiting security sites. The system has even been used by other countries.

In the comments, many were shocked by the level of surveillance. Some worried about abuse and lack of oversight. A few said this is why they use encryption, but others noted that using privacy tools can draw more attention. Some argued such programs are needed for safety, but most felt they go too far. There were jokes about online privacy, tips to reduce tracking, and technical curiosity about how so much data can be stored and searched. Most agreed that true privacy online is very hard.
