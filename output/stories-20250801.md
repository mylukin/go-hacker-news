## Does the Bitter Lesson Have Limits?

- 原文链接: [Does the Bitter Lesson Have Limits?](https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/08/01/does-the-bitter-lesson-have-limits.html)

This article talks about “the bitter lesson,” an idea in AI that says general methods using lots of computation work better than hand-crafted, human-designed approaches. The author explains how this lesson has shaped fields like chess, Go, speech, and vision, but asks if it has limits.

The bitter lesson is “bitter” because it shows that human knowledge and clever tricks help at first but are beaten in the long run by brute-force computing and learning from lots of data. Examples like AlphaGo and speech recognition show how scaling up data and compute wins over time. The author connects this to other moments in history where humans learned they are not as special as they thought, like learning the Earth is not the center of the universe.

The author then looks at how this idea fits with messy, real-world organizations. Many companies do not have clear processes or rules—what some call “Garbage Can” organizations. It’s hard to apply AI effectively in these places because their goals and data are unclear or messy. Unlike chess, where the rules and goals are clear, business processes are often unwritten or hard to measure.

The author points out that data is not neutral—it can be incomplete, biased, or hard to collect. Many things companies care about are tough to reduce to simple numbers. If you cannot clearly define “quality” or measure your goal, it is hard for AI to help. Even tools like OKRs (a way to set goals) can be gamed or not fully capture what matters.

The article also challenges the idea that more compute is always better. The chess engine Stockfish, for instance, combined smart search with a small neural network, beating bigger, more “brute force” models. This shows that efficient, focused approaches can sometimes be more practical and powerful than simply throwing more compute at a problem.

Recent AI benchmarks like ARC-AGI-1 show that small, specialized models can beat big, general ones on certain tasks, and they are cheap enough to run on a phone. Sometimes, human-designed rules and efficiency matter more in practice.

The author ends by saying the bitter lesson is useful, but not perfect. It works best when you can turn your problem into good, clear data, but many real-world problems are too messy for that. Sometimes, less compute and more human knowledge is the winning approach.

Top Hacker News comments both agree and disagree with the article. Some readers say the bitter lesson is important and has changed how they approach AI and software. Others note that in the real world, problems are often too fuzzy or complex for brute-force methods to work well. A few point out that clever, efficient solutions will always have a place, especially when compute is expensive or data is limited.

Some comments discuss how in fields like business, education, or law, it’s almost impossible to reduce everything to clean data or simple rules, so hand-crafted systems and human judgment are needed. Others mention that even in areas where AI has succeeded, like games, the best systems now mix human knowledge with machine learning.

A few readers worry that blind faith in more data and compute can lead to waste or bad outcomes, especially if the goals are not clear or the data is biased. Some praise the article for pointing out that “winning” in the real world often means balancing accuracy, cost, and practicality, not just chasing the biggest scores or fanciest models.

Overall, the discussion shows that while the bitter lesson is powerful, it is not absolute—real-world problems need a mix of approaches, and sometimes the “bitter” way is not the best way.

- 原文链接: [Show HN: Draw a fish and watch it swim with the others](https://drawafish.com)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44719222)

Someone made a website where you can draw a fish and then watch your fish swim with other people’s fish. The site is called drawafish.com.

You start by drawing a fish with your mouse or finger. The drawing tool is simple, so anyone can use it. After you finish, you submit your fish. Your fish then appears in a virtual fish tank. You see your fish swimming with many other fish, all drawn by other users. Each fish looks different because everyone draws in their own style. Some fish are funny, some are serious, and some are very simple. The tank updates in real time, so new fish show up as soon as people add them. There is also a ranking page. Here, users can vote for their favorite fish. This makes it fun to see which fish are the most popular. The site is easy to use and does not ask for any sign-up or personal information.

In the Hacker News comments, many people said they loved the idea and found it relaxing. Some users liked seeing the creativity of others. A few said it reminded them of older, more playful websites from the early internet days. Others pointed out how simple the technology is—just HTML, JavaScript, and maybe a bit of server code. Some wondered if there are ways to stop bad drawings or spam, as anyone can submit anything. One person suggested adding more features, like fish animations or backgrounds. Another said keeping it simple is better and makes the site special. A few developers asked about the code and if it will be open source. Some users joked about drawing strange or funny fish and spotting them later in the tank. Overall, most people enjoyed the site and said it was a nice break from more serious tech news.

## Researchers map where solar energy delivers the biggest climate payoff

- 原文链接: [Researchers map where solar energy delivers the biggest climate payoff](https://www.rutgers.edu/news/researchers-map-where-solar-energy-delivers-biggest-climate-payoff)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44762026)

This article explains where solar energy helps the climate the most in the United States. Researchers from Rutgers, Harvard, and Stony Brook used computer models and big energy datasets to find out which places get the biggest reduction in carbon pollution when solar power grows. The team looked at five years of hourly electricity and emissions data from 13 regions. They found that increasing solar power by 15% across the U.S. could cut 8.54 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions each year. The effect is not the same everywhere: places like California, Texas, Florida, the Midwest, and the Southwest see much bigger climate benefits, while areas like New England and central U.S. see smaller benefits. The study also showed that adding solar in one region can cut pollution in nearby regions—a "spillover" effect. For example, more solar in California also helps the Northwest and Southwest. This means that working together between states can make solar even more useful. The research used detailed data and new computer tools to map both fast and slower changes in pollution after solar use goes up. Policymakers and investors can use these maps to decide where to spend money on solar power for best results.

In the comment section, some people are excited to see data-driven advice for climate action. Many like the idea that solar’s benefits are not just local, but can help neighbors too. Others ask if the study looked at all the costs, such as building solar panels and the need for batteries. A few worry about solar power’s limits, like when it’s cloudy or at night. Some point out that places with less benefit from solar might need wind or other clean energy instead. There are also comments about the need for better power grids to move solar energy between regions. A few users ask about the effect on local wildlife and land use. One person hopes for more research like this in other countries. Overall, people agree that smart planning is important, and that data like this can help make better choices for both money and the climate.

## I couldn't submit a PR, so I got hired and fixed it myself

- 原文链接: [I couldn't submit a PR, so I got hired and fixed it myself](https://www.skeptrune.com/posts/doing-the-little-things/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44759417)

A software engineer saw a small but annoying bug in Mintlify’s search. He could not fix it before, because he did not have access to the code. Later, he got hired by the company, and finally fixed the problem himself.

The bug was about search results showing old or wrong results as you typed, because the code did not stop old search requests. This made the search feel broken or slow. He had talked about this bug with the team before, but they did not think it was important, so nothing changed. As the founder of the company that ran the search backend, it was extra frustrating for him, because it made his product look bad.

After joining the team, he fixed the bug by adding an AbortController to the search function. Now, when the user types, any old search requests are stopped, so results always match the latest input. He says this was very satisfying, like fixing a small thing that has annoyed you for a long time. He compares it to the story of George Hotz, a famous hacker who joined Twitter for a short time just to fix their search problems.

The article also talks about open source. If the project was open source, he could have fixed the bug much earlier by sending a pull request. But since it was not, he had to wait until he joined the company. He thinks open source is great for this reason, but understands why some companies keep code private.

He is happy he made search better for everyone, even if it was just a small fix. He believes small fixes can make a product great over time.

In the comments, some people agree that small issues like this can really hurt user experience, and fixing them is important. Others say it is sad that non-open source code makes it harder for people to help fix bugs. A few users mention that companies often do not fix small problems quickly, because they have other priorities. Some people praise the author for caring enough to get hired just to fix the bug. Others say this story is a good reminder of why open source is powerful. There are also opinions that companies should listen more to outside feedback, even from vendors. A few readers share their own stories where they wanted to fix a bug but could not, since they did not have access. Some people warn that hiring someone just to fix one problem is not always possible for most teams. Several commenters joke about the lengths developers will go to fix a “paper cut” bug. One or two users ask why it took so long to fix something that sounds simple. Some users point out that AbortController is a good tool, but not everyone knows about it. Lastly, a few people say the story is inspiring—sometimes you have to take big steps to solve small things.

## Deep Agents

- 原文链接: [Deep Agents](https://blog.langchain.com/deep-agents/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44761299)

This article is about “deep agents,” which are advanced AI agents that can plan and work on complex tasks for a long time. The author explains that simple agents just use a large language model (LLM) to call tools in a loop, but these are not smart enough for bigger jobs. To make agents better, tools like Deep Research, Manus, and Claude Code use four main things: detailed prompts, planning tools, sub agents, and access to a file system.

The article says most agents today just run in a loop, calling tools, but this makes them “shallow.” Shallow agents cannot plan or finish bigger tasks. Deep agents, on the other hand, can plan and work on complex projects, like research or coding. The core idea is still the same—an LLM calling tools—but deep agents add new features.

First, deep agents use long, detailed prompts. These prompts give clear instructions and lots of examples, so the agent knows how to act in many situations. Second, they use a planning tool, like a to-do list. Even if the to-do list does not do anything, it helps the agent stay focused. Third, deep agents can create sub agents. This means the main agent can split up work and let smaller agents handle different jobs. Fourth, deep agents have access to a file system. They can read and write files, save notes, and let all agents share information.

The author also shares an open source package called “deepagents.” It helps people build their own deep agents. You can install it easily and customize it with your own prompts, tools, and sub agents. It includes all the key features: a general prompt, a planning tool, sub agent support, and a virtual file system.

In the comments, some readers like the idea of deep agents and say these features are important for real-world tasks. Others worry that making agents more complex can make them harder to debug and control. A few people think that detailed prompts and file access are not enough—agents may still need better memory or reasoning. Some developers ask how well these agents handle very long or changing tasks. Others wonder if giving agents file system access is safe or could cause problems. One person points out that having many sub agents can use a lot of computing power. Another comment says open source tools like “deepagents” help everyone learn and build better agents. Some readers are excited to try the new package and share their own custom agents. Others hope for more examples and better documentation. A few people discuss if deep agents will make LLMs more useful in business and daily life. Some are still unsure if deep agents are really different from just using better prompts. Overall, the comments show both excitement and caution about deep agents.

## Gemini 2.5 Deep Think

- 原文链接: [Gemini 2.5 Deep Think](https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-2-5-deep-think/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44755279)

Google has released Deep Think, a new feature in the Gemini app, for AI Ultra subscribers and some mathematicians. Deep Think uses advanced AI to solve hard problems by thinking in parallel and spending more time searching for good answers.

This update is faster than the earlier version that won a gold medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), though it now performs at the bronze level for speed. Deep Think works by letting the AI explore many ideas at once, combining and improving them before picking the best answer. It uses longer "thinking time" and new training methods to help the AI get better at tough tasks. Deep Think is good for step-by-step projects, like building websites, writing code, or solving science and math problems. The article says Deep Think is great at coding, planning, and creative problem solving. In tests, it beats other models on hard benchmarks like LiveCodeBench V6 and Humanity’s Last Exam. Google says Deep Think is safer and more objective than before, but sometimes it refuses simple requests. You can use Deep Think in the Gemini app by turning it on in the model menu, and it works with tools like code execution and search. Google plans to test Deep Think even more with developers and businesses soon. The company is focused on making it safe, reliable, and useful.

People on Hacker News have mixed feelings. Some are excited, saying Deep Think could help with real research and make complex coding easier. Others worry it is only for paid users, and want wider access. A few people think the name "Deep Think" is confusing or sounds like hype. Some question if the model really understands problems or is just better at guessing. There are concerns about AI safety, as making these models smarter could bring new risks. Others ask if it can really help with new math or just repeat known ideas. Some like the idea of longer “thinking time,” while some doubt if that leads to better answers. A few developers say they want to use Deep Think in their own code and apps, but are waiting for API access. One person notes that refusing safe questions is annoying and could block real work. Overall, the community is interested, but wants more proof of real progress and open access.

## Ask HN: Who is hiring? (August 2025)

- 原文链接: [Ask HN: Who is hiring? (August 2025)](item?id=44757794)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44757794)

## Self-Signed JWTs

- 原文链接: [Self-Signed JWTs](https://www.selfref.com/self-signed-jwts)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44760561)

This article talks about self-signed JWTs and how they can make API authentication much simpler. The author is frustrated with the normal, complex way companies make developers use API keys, which involves many steps and tools.

Usually, to get an API key, you have to sign up on a website, verify your email, create a project, add a credit card, and handle secret and publishable keys carefully. You have to be sure not to share your keys or accidentally upload them to public code. The author thinks all these steps are too much and not needed.

Instead, the author shows how easy it is to create your own key pair using a few lines of code. With the jose library, you can generate your own JWK (JSON Web Key) pair, which can act as your private and public API keys. This means you don’t need to register anywhere or manage secret versus public keys anymore.

To use this, the server keeps the private key safe. When your app needs to do something special—like a privileged action—it creates a JWT (JSON Web Token) that lists what it wants to do. The JWT is signed with your private key. The client sends this JWT to the API, and the server can check both the signature and the claims to see if the action should be allowed.

For charging money, the API can check if a public key is linked to a paid account. If not, it sends back a payment link. After the user pays, their key is marked as paid, and they can use the API without more payment requests.

For B2B2C (business-to-business-to-consumer) cases, where your customers are developers who want to give their own users API keys, the author suggests using a system of derived keys. Developers make a master key and then create child keys for their users. The system checks if a user’s key is really from the developer, using special math proofs.

In the comments, some people like the idea of making API keys and authentication simpler. They say it’s clever and could save developers a lot of time. Others are worried about security. They point out that if you don’t protect your private key, someone could pretend to be you. Some developers say that the current system is hard because it deals with real issues like key leaks and abuse. Others say they like being able to create keys themselves and not depend on someone else’s system.

A few commenters wonder if this method would work for big companies with millions of users, or just for small projects. Some bring up that payment handling is still not simple, and might need extra work. One person likes the idea of using JWT claims to control actions, but others warn it could be easy to make mistakes. Some people mention that the B2B2C key derivation idea sounds complex and might be hard to use in real life. Others are excited by the idea of cutting out middlemen and making APIs more open. Overall, the discussion shows both excitement and some caution about changing how API keys and authentication work.

## Google shifts goo.gl policy: Inactive links deactivated, active links preserved

- 原文链接: [Google shifts goo.gl policy: Inactive links deactivated, active links preserved](https://blog.google/technology/developers/googl-link-shortening-update/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44759918)

Google is changing its plan for old goo.gl short links, which many people use to share web pages. Before, Google said it would stop all goo.gl links after August 25, 2025, but now, only links that have not been used since late 2024 will be deactivated.

If you have a goo.gl link and it shows a message saying, “This link will no longer work in the near future,” it will stop working after August 25. Google suggests you move these links to a new short link service. But if your goo.gl link still works right now and does not show this message, it will keep working after August 25. Google made this change because many people said they still use these links in documents, posts, and videos. To check your link, just open it—if it works without a warning, you are safe. This update is meant to help people who rely on goo.gl links and to avoid breaking many old links on the web.

In the Hacker News comments, some people are happy that Google listened to feedback and will keep active links working. Others are still worried about link rot, where old links on the internet stop working over time. A few users say this is why you should not trust short-link services for important content. Some mention that companies often shut down free services, so it is better to use your own domain for short links if you can. People also discuss how broken links can hurt old blog posts, research, or videos. A few are thankful that Google gave a warning and a way to check if links will be kept. Others wish Google would keep all links working, not just the active ones. Some say this is a good balance between saving old links and cleaning up unused ones. A few users ask for more open or self-hosted short-link tools in the future. Overall, many see this as a reminder not to depend on big companies for tools you need to last a long time.

## JSON is not a YAML subset (2022)

- 原文链接: [JSON is not a YAML subset (2022)](https://john-millikin.com/json-is-not-a-yaml-subset)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44762504)

This article explains why JSON is not a subset of YAML, even though many people think you can safely use a YAML parser to read JSON data. The writer shows that there are important differences between how the two formats handle certain values, especially strings, numbers, and special words like "no" or "false".

One big example is how YAML sometimes treats words like "no" as the boolean value false, while JSON sees them as regular strings. If you put the list [FI, NO, SE] into a YAML parser, you might get ["FI", false, "SE"], which is not what you expect if you wrote that in JSON. This is called the "Norway Problem," because "NO" is the country code for Norway, but YAML thinks it means "no" as in "false".

Another problem is with numbers that use scientific notation. In JSON, 1e2 is a number (it means 100). But in YAML 1.1, this format is not valid, so the parser turns it into the string "1e2" instead of the number 100. For example, if you load {"a": 1e2} in a JSON parser, you get {"a": 100.0}, but in a YAML parser, you get {"a": "1e2"}.

YAML tried to fix these differences in version 1.2 and become a true superset of JSON, but this only works if the YAML file starts with a special line, %YAML 1.2. Most JSON files do not have this, so a YAML parser will still use the old rules and may not read JSON data the way you expect.

In short, the article warns that just because YAML and JSON look similar, it does not mean you can use them the same way or swap them easily. Mistakes can happen, and sometimes they are hard to find.

From the comments, many people agree with the article and share stories about how mixing YAML and JSON caused bugs in their projects. Some say they used YAML parsers for JSON to save time, but had strange results with numbers or special words. Others point out that YAML's rules for detecting data types are confusing and not worth the trouble.

A few commenters mention that newer YAML libraries try to fix these issues, but old code and tools are still common. Some people think JSON is easier to understand and less likely to surprise you, so they avoid YAML when they can. Others argue that YAML is more readable for humans, but you must be careful with its quirks.

Several users discuss the Norway Problem and say it is a classic example of why YAML can be risky. Some say that using quotes for every string in YAML helps avoid mistakes, but it makes the files harder to write. There are also comments about how YAML version differences make things harder, especially when working with different tools.

In the end, most people agree: if you have JSON, use a JSON parser, and do not trust YAML parsers to handle it correctly. This helps you avoid bugs and confusion in your code.
