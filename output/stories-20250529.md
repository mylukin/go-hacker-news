The article talks about a dangerous job: disarming an atomic bomb. In 1952, a bomb test named "Shot Fox" in Nevada didn't go as planned. Instead of exploding, the bomb malfunctioned, and someone had to disarm it.

The bomb was on a 300-foot tower, ready to explode with a force of 15 kilotons. A team of scientists and military observers were present, and they had to act quickly. Dr. John C. Clark, from the Atomic Energy Commission, was in charge. He had to disarm the bomb with the help of engineers Herb Grier and Barnie O’Keefe, who decided by flipping a coin who would accompany Clark.

They climbed the tower without an elevator, carrying minimal tools like a hacksaw. Clark had experience with a similar situation before, which helped him stay calm. While disarming, Clark carefully worked through the bomb's electronics. Even after deactivating the nuclear part, there was still enough conventional explosive to be dangerous. After a long and tense process, they safely disarmed the bomb.

In the comment section, people talked about the stress of such a job. Some joked that if you made a mistake, you wouldn’t notice because you'd be gone instantly. Others pointed out the soldiers who were used to observe the bomb's effects had it worse. There was also some curiosity about Dr. Clark, as not much information is available about him, despite his bravery. Another commenter mentioned the danger of the job, comparing it to being stranded at sea, noting that both are high-risk and stressful.
