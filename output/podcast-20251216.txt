Hello everyone, this is the 2025-12-16 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have stories about graphics APIs and their complexity, how AI could make formal verification easier, OpenAI’s new ChatGPT Images update, questions about how we measure happiness, the meaning of “thick” and “thin” desires, a developer building a Telegram clone in Rust and QML, new research about fMRI scans, and Japan updating the rules for writing Japanese in English letters. Let’s get started.

First, let’s talk about graphics APIs. Sebastian Aaltonen, an expert in graphics, explains why modern graphics APIs like DirectX 12, Vulkan, and Metal have become very complex. Ten years ago, new low-level APIs gave developers more control and better performance, but also made programming harder. Programmers now have to manage many small details that old APIs like DirectX 11 or OpenGL used to handle for them. This has led to bigger codebases and more specialized roles.

Aaltonen says that today’s GPUs are much more flexible than before. Many of the reasons for complex APIs are now gone. For example, instead of lots of special data formats and binding tricks, you could just use simple pointers to memory, like how CUDA works for AI. The article suggests that a simpler API would let developers use normal C or C++ pointers to GPU memory, making it easy to share data and copy it when needed. For textures, the author proposes using a big texture array, so you can just access them by index, instead of using complex binding systems. Shader code could also be simpler, using normal pointers and structs.

Another pain point is barriers—commands that make sure data is ready before the GPU uses it. Modern hardware does not need most of the complex tracking that APIs require now. Aaltonen suggests a much simpler system. Command buffers, which are lists of things for the GPU to do, could also be easier. Instead of trying to reuse them, the API should just let developers make new ones every frame, which is what most engines do already.

For drawing 3D objects, Aaltonen thinks most of the current setup could be replaced by just passing pointers to structs, making the code shorter and easier to understand.

In the comments, many developers agree that graphics APIs have become too hard to use. Some say they miss the simplicity of old APIs, even if they were slower. Others like the control that new APIs give but wish they were easier to learn and debug. A few worry that making things too simple might hide important details or make optimization harder. Some point out that different GPU vendors have different needs, so it may be hard to get everyone to agree on a new API. Others say that changing APIs could break old software, but many are excited about the idea and hope GPU makers will listen.

Next, we have an article about AI and formal verification. Formal verification is a way to prove that software is correct, even for very rare or strange cases. Today, very few people use it, because it is hard, slow, and expensive. For example, proving that a small operating system is correct took twenty person-years and many lines of proof code.

The main problem is cost: it is usually cheaper to just fix bugs than to write formal proofs. Bugs often hurt users more than developers, so there is little push for these expensive methods. But now, AI coding assistants can write both code and proof scripts. These AIs still need help from experts for now, but soon they could do most of the work alone.

If AI makes formal verification cheap, more teams will use it. As AI generates more code, we will want to prove it is correct, not just check it by hand. Proof checkers only accept correct proofs, so if the AI makes a mistake, it can try again until it gets it right. Still, writing good specifications—clear rules for what the code should do—will remain a hard problem, but maybe easier than writing all proofs by hand. AI might also help translate between normal language and formal specs.

The author believes that in the future, developers might just describe what they want, and the AI will write both the code and proof. This could change how we build software, just like we no longer check every line of machine code from a compiler.

In the comments, some readers are excited about AI making formal verification common. Others say that writing good specs is still very hard, and AI may not solve that problem soon. Some point out that even proof checkers can have bugs, so nothing is perfect. A few share their own struggles with formal tools, saying they are hard to use. Some think big companies or safety-critical fields will use this first, while normal software may take longer. Others worry that trusting AI proofs too much could lead to new problems. Some like the idea that AI can keep trying proofs until it gets them right, but note this can use a lot of computer power. Many agree that making formal verification easier could change how we build software.

Now let’s move to OpenAI’s update to ChatGPT Images, powered by the new GPT Image 1.5 model. This tool lets users create and edit images faster and with more control. You can add, remove, or change parts of images while keeping important details the same, like lighting or faces. The model is better at following detailed instructions and making creative edits, such as making movie posters or adding text. The text in pictures is now sharper, even for small or dense writing.

ChatGPT Images now has its own place in the app and website, making it easier to try new ideas. You can use preset styles, trending prompts, and upload your photo once to use your face in many images. Images are made up to four times faster, and you can work on new images while others are still being made.

For developers, the API is now cheaper and better at keeping logos or other details the same across edits. This helps with making product images for online shops or marketing graphics. Companies like Wix and Figma are already using it.

OpenAI says the model is much improved, but there are still some limits, like working with many faces or different languages. The old version of ChatGPT Images will still be available as a custom tool.

On Hacker News, some users are excited about the faster speed and better editing. They say it helps with design, marketing, or just for fun. Others like the better instruction following, especially for complex edits or text. Some mention that keeping the same style or face across edits is very useful for creative work. A few worry about mistakes, like images with too many faces or problems with foreign languages. Some talk about the impact on jobs, saying this could reduce the need for some designers. Copyright concerns are raised, especially for logos and brands. There are also questions about how OpenAI will handle misuse or harmful images. Some are happy about the lower API price, saying it helps small businesses try more ideas. Others say that while the tool is powerful, real creativity is still needed. The community finds the update exciting but wants more details about safety and future plans.

Next, we have an article about the World Happiness Report. Every year, this report says countries like Finland and Denmark are the happiest, but the article argues that the way happiness is measured is misleading. The report is based mainly on one question, the Cantril Ladder, which asks people to rate their life from 0 to 10. This question does not really ask about happiness, so people may answer based on money, status, or success, not daily feelings.

The article also notes that countries like Finland and Sweden have high rates of depression and suicide, which does not match the idea that they are the happiest. New research using more emotion-based questions changes the rankings a lot. Finland falls down the list, while countries like Japan and Panama look much happier. Inside the US, states like Hawaii and Minnesota score higher than Finland when using these broader questions.

In the comments, some agree that measuring happiness is very hard and culture plays a big role. Others say that even if people in Scandinavia do not smile much, they may feel secure and satisfied, which is different from joy. Some think the Cantril Ladder is still useful for a simple number. Many agree that no ranking will ever be perfect and we should be careful with the data. Some share personal stories about living in high-ranking countries but not feeling happy. Others say that economic safety may be more important than joy. Most agree that both the question and the way results are shared need more skepticism.

Now let’s look at an article about “thick” and “thin” desires. The writer says that many people today feel hungry for something, but do not know what it is. “Thick desires” are goals that change you, like learning a skill or building a deep friendship. “Thin desires” give you a quick reward, like checking your phone or scrolling social media. The author says tech companies give us the feeling of thick desires, but without real effort or change.

Thin desires are everywhere and easy to get, while thick desires take time and patience. Places and ways to find thick desires—like clubs or face-to-face time—are disappearing, replaced by things that are quick and easy. The author suggests small ways to bring thick desires back: bake bread, write letters, or build software just for a friend. These things are slow and will not make you famous, but can help you feel whole.

In the comments, some agree and say they also feel empty after too much time online. Others say it is hard to avoid thin desires because tech is made to be addictive and people are busy. Some point out that not everyone has time or money for slow hobbies. Others think both thick and thin desires have a place, and balance is important. Some say tech can also help people grow if used well. Many see the problem, but have different ideas about what to do.

Next, we have a story about a developer trying to build a Telegram clone using Qt, QML, Rust, and some C++. The author likes QML for building nice interfaces quickly and prefers Rust for safety. They wanted to make a “native” app, not a web app, and chose Telegram as a model because its desktop UI feels great. They tried two Rust-Qt bridges: cxx-qt and qmetaobject-rs. cxx-qt gives full Qt access but is slow to build, while qmetaobject-rs is simpler and faster but with fewer features.

To speed up development, the author made a basic hot reload system, so the app restarts and loads new UI when files change. They copied parts of Telegram’s UI, like the sidebar and chat splitter, and made their own version of the splitter. They enjoyed making animations and UI details with QML. When they needed features not in Rust or QML, like changing the mouse cursor, they wrote small C++ modules and called them from Rust.

The project is called “Provoke” and is open source on GitHub. The author is not sure if they will keep working on it, but had fun learning.

Commenters on Hacker News had mixed views. Some praised the write-up and found it inspiring. Others pointed out that mixing Rust, QML, and C++ can be hard to maintain. A few were surprised how far the author got with Rust and QML. Some shared their own struggles with QML or build tools, while others said QML is still the best for building beautiful desktop UIs quickly. There was some debate about which Rust-Qt bridge is better. Some liked the hot reload hack. Others doubted the long-term usefulness or said copying big apps is very hard. Overall, the thread was friendly and made some want to try QML or Rust.

Now, let’s talk about new research on fMRI scans. For 30 years, fMRI has been used to study brain activity, but new research shows that almost 40% of its signals do not match real brain activity. The usual idea is that more brain activity means more blood flow and more oxygen, but that is not always true. Sometimes the fMRI signal goes up when real activity goes down, or active areas do not show more blood flow. The researchers found that often, brain areas just use oxygen more efficiently rather than getting more blood flow.

This is important for brain science, especially in studies about diseases like depression or Alzheimer’s. Many old studies may be wrong, especially in people with blood vessel problems. The researchers say future studies should use more direct ways to measure oxygen use.

On Hacker News, some users say this is not really new—scientists have known that fMRI is not perfect for a long time. Others say the BOLD signal is indirect and depends on many things. A few worry that many studies may need to be redone. Some think this will push more people to use new methods or improve fMRI. Others say science is always changing as we learn more. Some point out that fMRI can still be useful if used carefully.

Finally, Japan is planning to update the rules for writing Japanese words with Latin letters—called romanization—for the first time in 70 years. The goal is to make it easier for people to read and use Japanese words in English letters. The most common system now is Hepburn, which tries to show Japanese sounds in a way English speakers can understand, but some sounds do not match well. The government wants to update the rules for things like passports, place names, and learning materials, and to help with computers and phones. The old rules were made long ago, and language has changed. With the internet and new technology, clear romanization is more important than before.

In the comments, some like the idea and say it will help travelers and students. Others worry that changing the system will make things more confusing, especially for people who learned the old way. Some point out that no system is perfect and Japanese should just be written in Japanese. There are comments about how other countries handle their languages and alphabets. Some developers talk about how romanization affects software and search engines. A few share funny examples of Japanese words in English letters. Many hope the changes will make things easier, but know it will take time to get used to new rules.
