## Sguaba: Hard-to-misuse rigid body transforms for engineers

- 原文链接: [Sguaba: Hard-to-misuse rigid body transforms for engineers](https://blog.helsing.ai/sguaba-hard-to-misuse-rigid-body-transforms-for-engineers-with-other-things-to-worry-about-than-aeaa45af9e0d)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44146744)

The article talks about Sguaba, a Rust library designed to make handling different coordinate systems in engineering projects easier and less error-prone. In the world of software dealing with real-world coordinates, mixing up coordinate systems can lead to big problems. Sguaba uses Rust's strong typing to ensure that coordinates and vectors are kept within their correct systems, making it hard to accidentally mix them up. This is achieved by using specific types like `Coordinate`, `Vector`, and `Orientation`, and by leveraging Rust's type system for safe transformations between systems.

The article gives an example where a plane's pilot needs to convert an observation from the plane's local coordinate system (FRD) to global coordinates (WGS84). The library makes this transformation process clear and safe by requiring explicit conversion and using the Rust type system to prevent mistakes. Sguaba does use complex math concepts like quaternions and involves some `unsafe` code for certain transformations, but it aims to keep things straightforward for engineers who might not be math experts. The creators see room for improvement, like adding more coordinate systems and better documentation, and they invite contributions from the community.

In the comments, there's agreement on the value of strongly typing coordinates to avoid implicit conversions, which can cause many bugs. One commenter emphasizes that this approach should be used in any typed language, not just Rust. They suggest creating specific types for different coordinate pairs and implementing necessary algebra, which can prevent numerous headaches in production work. While the commenter hasn't used Sguaba, they agree with its principles, highlighting the importance of this practice in software development.

- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44145517)

The article talks about a new project by Terence Tao, where he adapts his textbook "Analysis I" into Lean, a proof assistant tool. This project translates sections of the book into Lean code, allowing students to practice proofs and exercises in a formal setting.

Terence Tao's textbook "Analysis I" focused on constructing number systems and providing foundational set theory and logic. While formal verification wasn't a focus back then, he now sees how well the book aligns with proof assistants like Lean, which uses dependent type theory. The Lean companion offers a new way to do exercises by filling in "sorries" in Lean code, which are placeholders for proofs that users must complete. The project is separate from, but sometimes relies on, Lean's Mathlib standard library, aiming to gradually shift to Mathlib's definitions in later chapters. This approach also serves as an introduction to both Lean and real analysis, similar to the "Natural number game."

In the Hacker News comments, people are excited about this project. One user appreciates how it connects Tao's book with Lean, making rigorous math more accessible to programmers. Some discuss the potential of teaching math using formalized libraries like Mathlib, but note it's not ideal for beginners. Others highlight the benefit of immediate feedback from Lean when proofs don't compile, similar to how programming languages offer error messages. Some are concerned about how useful proving isomorphism to Mathlib is, while others find it valuable for understanding and teaching. Overall, there's a mix of enthusiasm and curiosity about how formal methods can enhance math education.

The article talks about a 500-year-old clock in East Hendred, Oxfordshire, which still helps the village keep time. This historic clock, located in St Augustine's church, doesn't have a face or hands but uses bells to mark the time every quarter hour. Installed during Henry VIII's reign, it is one of Britain's oldest clocks still in its original place. The clock uses a carillon, a system of winches and pulleys, to strike the bells and play a tune four times a day. In 2015, it got jammed but was later restored and fitted with a mechanized winding system to replace manual winding. The clock used to be set with a sundial but now uses a digital clock for accuracy.

Commenters on Hacker News shared various thoughts. Some love the history and charm of such ancient artifacts in Europe. A few related their own experiences with church bells, saying they learned to tell time by their sound. Others debated the clock's authenticity since parts have been replaced over time, comparing it to the Ship of Theseus philosophical concept. There were discussions about whether a clock remains the same if its parts are changed, much like how our bodies renew cells. Some felt the clock represents a piece of cultural heritage, while others noted that technology today often lacks such longevity, praising the clock's durability despite needing some manual care.

A project called PunchCard Key Backup aims to store 128 bits of data on a physical medium using punched cards. This tool helps you take a 128-bit number, like a password or key, and back it up on a small aluminum card by punching holes in it. You don't need much more than some aluminum, a punch tool, and a drill to make these cards at home.

The process starts by using a provided HTML tool to generate a hole-punching pattern based on your data. You then use a stencil to mark where to punch holes on the aluminum sheet. The project also provides simple Python snippets to manually convert the data to and from binary if you prefer not to use the HTML tool. This method offers a sturdy way to safeguard critical information, especially useful if you want a backup that survives physical disasters like fire or floods.

In the Hacker News comments, users shared mixed views. Some love the idea and want to use CNC machines to automate the process, while others think a QR code might be simpler. People also discussed making the backups more secure with special tools or materials. One user noted how this reminds them of old army keys meant to be destroyed after use. Another pointed out that, while the method is low-tech, it's effective for those who want a long-lasting and secret backup.

Some commenters highlighted the risk of forgetting how to decode the punched pattern over time, suggesting that engraving regular characters might be simpler. Others suggested improvements, like adding instructions on the back of the card or using laser etching. The conversation also touched on the importance of choosing the right materials to ensure the durability of the backup card.
