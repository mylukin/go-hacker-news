Hello everyone, this is the 2026-01-19 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we bring you a rich selection of stories and discussions from the world of technology, history, and innovation.

First, let’s talk about a secret manual from 1944, written by the US Office of Strategic Services. This manual taught ordinary people how to use simple sabotage to slow down enemy forces during war. The most interesting part is that anyone could do sabotage with everyday items—no special training or tools needed. The manual describes two main types of sabotage. One is physical, like starting fires, breaking machines, or ruining fuel. The other is behavioral, such as slowing work, making bad decisions on purpose, or causing confusion in offices by insisting on paperwork or arguing over rules. The manual gives many examples: letting tools become dull, putting sand or sugar in engines, jamming locks, and even making meetings longer or less effective. It encourages people to act in small, safe ways so they do not get caught, and says humor and clear reasons can help overcome fear. Many sabotage acts are designed to look like honest mistakes, such as working slowly or giving wrong directions.

Hacker News users found the manual both fascinating and funny, especially the office sabotage parts. Many noticed that some of these techniques still happen today, but by accident, not on purpose. Some joked that modern companies seem to follow this manual by mistake, especially with too much bureaucracy and endless meetings. But others warned that physical sabotage is dangerous and could hurt innocent people, and today these acts would be crimes. Some readers felt the manual shows why organizations should stay simple and efficient, to avoid problems—accidental or not. Others were interested in the history and asked if other countries had similar manuals. Some were surprised that the CIA made this manual public and said it’s a good lesson in how small actions can add up, both in war and in daily life.

Next, we have a story about a small change at Cloudflare that caused big DNS problems in January 2026. Cloudflare changed the order of CNAME and A records in their DNS server to save memory. Before, CNAMEs always came first, followed by the A record. After the update, CNAMEs sometimes came last. Some DNS clients, like the Linux getaddrinfo function and some Cisco devices, could not handle the new order. This caused some websites and devices to stop working or even reboot. Newer DNS clients do not have this problem, but many old ones do.

The original DNS rules from 1987 are not clear if CNAMEs must come first. Cloudflare thought it was fine to change the order, but real-world software depended on the old way. In the end, Cloudflare decided to go back to the old order and will not change it again. They are also helping to make a new rule that will require CNAMEs to come first in DNS answers.

Hacker News readers said this is a great example of how old software and unclear standards can break the Internet in strange ways. Some pointed out that both Cloudflare and the clients are right and wrong, because the rules are not clear. Others said it shows the risk of changing old protocols, even for small improvements. Some experts explained that fixing these old habits is hard because some devices never get updates. Many thanked Cloudflare for being open about the problem and sharing what they learned.

Moving on, let’s talk about Apple’s Nano Texture, a new screen option for MacBook Pro laptops. This special glass finish reduces glare from lights and sunlight, making it easier to work in bright places, like coffee shops or outdoors. The Nano Texture works by etching tiny patterns onto the glass, scattering light and cutting reflections. Users say it lets them work almost anywhere without worrying about glare, which is great for coding or writing. However, the screen needs special care. Smudges and fingerprints are easy to see and harder to clean, and you must use a special cloth. The upgrade also costs $150 extra, and the screen can scratch more easily.

Compared to the Daylight Computer, a grayscale tablet with a transflective screen, the Nano Texture MacBook offers color and high resolution, but still relies on a backlight. Both are big steps forward for outdoor computing.

In the comments, many agreed that glare is a big problem with modern glossy screens. Some said old anti-glare coatings were easier to care for, though not as pretty. Others felt the Nano Texture is too expensive and high-maintenance. Some worry about how long the finish will last and if cleaning will get harder over time. A few users would prefer to see more matte screens from all companies, not just Apple. Some like the idea of working outside more, while others think the cleaning rules are too strict. There were also tips for keeping any laptop screen safe and clean.

Next, we have an article about how C++ manages object ownership, which means who is responsible for creating and destroying objects. In C++, you must think carefully about ownership to avoid bugs or memory leaks. This is different from languages with garbage collection, where memory is managed for you.

C++ uses a principle called RAII—when an object goes out of scope, its destructor runs and cleans up resources. Modern C++ uses smart pointers, like unique_ptr, to help manage memory automatically. The article explains that references must not outlive the objects they point to, or you get undefined behavior. Move semantics allow you to transfer resources from one object to another without copying, making code faster and safer.

In the comments, many agree that understanding ownership is key to using C++ well. Some said they struggled when moving from garbage collected languages, but smart pointers and RAII help a lot. Others pointed out that you still need to be careful with object lifetimes and references. Some wish C++ had more checks like Rust, while others value the flexibility. There are tips about always using smart pointers and clear comments. Some mentioned that even experienced developers can make mistakes, so it’s important to keep learning.

Now, let’s talk about a new report on social media research. It found that almost one-third of academic studies about social media do not clearly disclose their connections to companies like Facebook or Twitter. These ties could be money, data access, or other help. Open disclosure is important for trust, and some worry that hidden links may cause bias. The article calls for better rules and more careful checks by journals. The report is still a preprint, so it has not been peer-reviewed yet.

In the comments, some people were not surprised and said industry money is common in tech research. Others worried that hidden ties make it hard to trust results, especially for powerful topics like social media. Some think the real problem is with journals and universities not checking disclosures well enough. Others suggest stronger rules and more independent research. Many agree that more openness would help trust in science.

Next, there is a video showing how 2D ray tracing works in a web browser. Ray tracing is a graphics method that simulates how light moves and bounces. In this 2D version, you can draw walls and mirrors, place a light source, and see how rays travel and reflect. The demo is interactive and runs in the browser, with open source code on GitHub. The creator also recommends “The Ray Tracer Challenge” book for those who want to learn more.

Comments were very positive. Users said the explanation was clear and easy to follow. Some were happy to see a simple, hands-on approach to computer graphics. A few shared stories about trying to make similar projects, and others said the demo could inspire beginners.

Now, let’s talk about subth.ink, a website where you can write a thought and see if anyone else has had the same idea. You enter up to 256 characters, and the site checks if your exact sentence matches others, but does not save your text. Instead, it creates a secret hash code from your words. You can use the website or a command line tool, and see the most common thoughts by their code and count, not by text.

People liked the idea and the focus on privacy. Some worried that if unsalted hashes are made public, it may not be fully private for short thoughts. Others wanted to see the actual words of popular thoughts, but most agreed this could be risky for privacy. Some liked the easy API and thought it could be a fun social experiment or a way to teach about hashes. There were also ideas for improving the site with better search or data views.

Next, we have CornerFix, a small app for macOS 26 (Tahoe) that helps people who do not like the new rounded display corners. The app lets you add overlays to make the screen look like it has sharp, straight edges again. It does not change the windows themselves, just the very edge of the display. You can adjust the size, color, and use it on multiple monitors. The app is open source, safe to use, and does not need special permissions.

In the comments, some users were happy to see this tool, because they dislike the new rounded corners. Others think it is a small issue and do not mind the new look. Some joked about developers spending time fixing tiny design choices from big companies. Many liked the safe overlay approach, and some shared tips on matching the cap color to the wallpaper. Overall, the community was split, but most respected the work put into the project.

Now, let’s look at a Python library called “window-art” that lets you make moving art by creating and controlling windows on your desktop. You can write code to make windows move, change color, fade, display text, images, or videos in real time. The project is open source and easy to install with pip. The code is simple and good for quick experiments, live shows, or demos.

Comments were mixed. Some liked the idea and felt nostalgic about making window art in the past. Others wanted to try it for live performances or teaching coding. There were technical questions about performance and compatibility, and some ideas for adding sound support. A few users did not see a real use case, but most were curious and supportive.

Finally, we have an inspiring story about Gordon Boettger and Bruce Campbell flying a glider from Nevada to Kansas, covering 1,112 miles in one day. The flight started early in the morning, using a special glider and careful planning. They relied on weather prediction tools and help from air traffic controllers. The biggest challenge was crossing the Rocky Mountains, flying at night in cold air with ice forming inside the cockpit. The team managed to find the right air currents and reached their goal after more than 12 hours in the air.

Many people in the comments congratulated the pilots and admired the teamwork and planning. Some were interested in the technical details and support from air traffic controllers. Others said the story inspired them to learn more about soaring and gliding.
