A recent study from the University of California San Diego found a new cause for Alzheimer's disease using AI to understand a gene's hidden role. Researchers focused on a gene called PHGDH, previously known as a biomarker, but discovered it plays a direct role in the disease. They used AI to visualize the gene's three-dimensional structure, uncovering how it disrupts brain cell functions, leading to Alzheimer's. This finding opens the door to new treatments, such as using a molecule called NCT-503, which targets the gene's newfound role without affecting its main function. This approach may help prevent the formation of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's.

In the Hacker News comments, many users debated the role of AI in this study. Some felt the article exaggerated AI's contribution, noting that the researchers did most of the biochemistry work themselves. Others pointed out that AI did play a crucial part, similar to how new technologies like telescopes aid discoveries. A few commenters criticized the article's title, suggesting it was clickbait to attract more attention. Meanwhile, some expressed hope that AI could lead to breakthroughs in Alzheimer's research, citing personal experiences with the disease in their families. Overall, the discussion reflected diverse opinions on AI's role in scientific advancements and the importance of clear reporting.

## New material gives copper superalloy-like strength

- 原文链接: [New material gives copper superalloy-like strength](https://news.lehigh.edu/new-material-gives-copper-superalloy-like-strength-0)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43816327)

The article discusses a new copper alloy with tantalum and lithium that achieves superalloy-like strength. This alloy is made of 96.5% copper, 3% tantalum, and 0.5% lithium. Adding lithium forms a Cu3Li intermetallic compound that attracts tantalum, creating a strong matrix. With a yield strength of around 1000 MPa, it compares to nickel superalloys, though less than the best steel. It's cheaper and less hazardous than copper-beryllium alloys, making it a potential replacement in various applications.

In the comments, opinions vary. Some users highlight the cost and scarcity of materials like tantalum, which could limit the alloy's affordability and availability. Others note the political issues tied to cobalt production, which this copper alloy could help avoid. Some think the alloy's strength and thermal conductivity could make it suitable for high-temperature uses like turbines or heat exchangers. However, concerns about its costliness and the complexity of its production process remain. There's also skepticism about its use in everyday items like bike frames or kitchenware due to its price and weight compared to alternatives like aluminum and stainless steel. Overall, while promising, this new copper alloy might find its niche in specialized, high-performance applications rather than replacing existing materials widely.

The article "I Just Want to Code" explores the author's internal struggle between coding for fun and coding for profit. The author describes this conflict using the metaphor of an angel and a devil on their shoulders. The angel represents curiosity and enjoyment, while the devil pushes for financial success and status. The author has loved computers since childhood, starting with games and evolving through various coding experiences. Despite enjoying coding, they feel pressured by societal norms to monetize their skills, leading to a constant balancing act between personal satisfaction and financial necessity.

The article dives into the broader context of tech culture, where there's a strong push towards entrepreneurship and the idea of turning every hobby into a side hustle. The author acknowledges the allure of "hustle culture," driven by media and social platforms that glamorize startups and financial success. They argue that while it might be ideal to only pursue enjoyable projects, real-world obligations mean it's necessary to occasionally heed the devil's call to stay current with technology and pay the bills. Ultimately, the author concludes that while they can't ignore the devil completely, they are learning to manage this internal conflict better as they mature.

In the Hacker News comments, a variety of opinions emerge. Some commenters, like LandR, find joy in coding purely for fun, completely separating work from their hobbies. Others, like optymizer, struggle with turning off their work mindset, often thinking about coding problems even outside work hours. Fripplebubby shares the difficulty of separating business thoughts from hobby coding, while blenderob counters that it's possible to code for fun without business pressures.

Commenters also discuss the broader implications of coding as a profession. Some, like Arisaka1, express relief at stepping away from the pressure of the tech industry, finding more joy in coding without the stress. Others, like sethammons and pc86, emphasize that coding is a cushy job compared to more physically demanding roles they’ve held in the past. Meanwhile, Clubber discusses the entrepreneurial mindset, noting that coding with a product focus develops different skills compared to coding for fun. The discussion highlights a range of experiences and attitudes towards coding, reflecting the personal nature of balancing passion and profession.

- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43820228)

The article on Hacker News introduces PyXL, a hardware processor designed to run Python directly in silicon without traditional interpreters or virtual machines. PyXL achieves a 480ns GPIO roundtrip, significantly faster than MicroPython's PyBoard, demonstrating speed and deterministic timing in real-time applications.

PyXL works by compiling Python code into CPython ByteCode, translating it to a custom assembly, and executing it on a custom processor. The processor is implemented on a Zynq-7000 FPGA with the ARM CPU handling setup and memory, while the Python code runs in hardware. This approach eliminates typical overhead from interpreters, making it suitable for real-time and embedded systems. The current toolchain, written in Python, compiles programs into a format that the PyXL processor can execute directly.

In the Hacker News comments, users expressed curiosity about PyXL's limitations and potential. The creator, hwpythonner, explained that PyXL currently supports a subset of Python and aims to expand based on clear use cases. Some commenters suggested exploring RPython or leveraging work done by PyPy to optimize Python execution. Others debated the feasibility of similar hardware projects for other languages like Lisp or Java. Several users also compared PyXL to existing technologies like PyPy, noting its focus on hardware execution for low-latency applications. Overall, the community showed great interest in PyXL's potential to revolutionize Python's use in embedded and real-time systems.

## Inference-Aware Fine-Tuning for Best-of-N Sampling in Large Language Models

- 原文链接: [Inference-Aware Fine-Tuning for Best-of-N Sampling in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15287)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43817377)

The article talks about a new way to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) called "Inference-Aware Fine-Tuning" for improving their performance when using Best-of-N (BoN) sampling. This method involves fine-tuning models to enhance how they choose the best response from multiple generated ones. The researchers use imitation learning and reinforcement learning to help the models do this more effectively, even with complex tasks like picking the best option from many.

The paper shows that their method improved the performance of a model named Gemma 2B on specific benchmarks. For instance, they boosted the model's accuracy on a math benchmark from 26.8% to 30.8% and on another test from 60.0% to 67.0%. These improvements suggest that their approach helps the models make better use of computing power during inference.

In the comments, people are quite interested in this new idea. One commenter thinks the idea is promising, as it helps models naturally add diversity to their responses, which could be useful for larger models. Another commenter wonders if this method is similar to existing algorithms like DeepSeek's GRPO. Some people express interest in seeing more examples of the model's output to understand the improvements better. There's also curiosity about whether BoN sampling is standard practice, as it seems costly, and others discuss how this method could lead to better exploration and performance without increasing costs. Lastly, there's a discussion about whether reducing bit precision in models is sustainable, with some suggesting alternative ways to handle computation.
