Hello everyone, this is the 2025-04-30 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we explore a variety of intriguing topics from the world of technology and software development.

First up, let's dive into the fascinating project of downloading all of Hacker News using a custom tool. The creator developed this tool in Go to gather data from the beginning of Hacker News to the present, amassing a whopping 20 GiB of data. Utilizing DuckDB, they analyzed the data to uncover trends, such as the frequency of mentions of programming languages like Python, JavaScript, and Rust over time. This project sparked a lively discussion among users, with some impressed by the technical achievement and others pondering the ethical implications of handling such a massive dataset. Concerns about privacy and the potential for bot-generated content replacing human input also surfaced, adding layers to the debate.

Next, we shift our focus to the cybersecurity realm, where SentinelOne, a prominent company, navigates the complex landscape of cyber threats. These threats come from various sources, including nation-state actors like North Korean IT workers and Chinese state-sponsored hackers, as well as ransomware groups. SentinelOne's strategies include detecting fake job applicants and leveraging automation to thwart infiltration attempts. The article prompted discussions on Hacker News about the effectiveness of current cybersecurity measures, with some viewing it as a marketing pitch for SentinelOne. Others delved into the broader challenges of securing systems and the necessity of continuous improvement in cybersecurity practices.

Moving on to the world of AI, Xiaomi's MiMo project has introduced MiMo-7B, a compact yet powerful language model tailored for reasoning tasks in math and code. Despite its relatively modest size of 7 billion parameters, MiMo-7B competes with much larger models. Xiaomi's approach combines pre-training and post-training techniques, and the models are freely available to the community. Commenters on Hacker News expressed interest in Xiaomi's use of unit testing during training and discussed the prevalence of English in AI development. The challenges of creating language models in Chinese, given the closed nature of the internet, also emerged as a topic of conversation.

Lastly, we explore a quirky but captivating project that allows you to run Linux inside Microsoft Excel. Known as LinuxInExcel, this project employs an emulator called mini-rv32ima, controlled by a VBA macro, to display Linux output within Excel cells. While primarily a fun experiment, it has sparked humor and curiosity among users. Some reminisced about similar unconventional projects, while others debated the limitations of Excel across different platforms. The playful spirit of this project highlights the creativity and ingenuity often found in the tech community.

That's all for today's episode. Thank you for joining us on this journey through the latest in technology and software development. We'll be back tomorrow with more stories and insights from the tech world. Until then, stay curious and keep innovating!
