Hello everyone, this is the 2025-04-22 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we dive into a fascinating mix of tech stories, unraveling innovative experiments, intriguing projects, and cutting-edge advancements. Let's get started!

First up, we explore a blog post titled "Attacking My Landlord's Boiler." The author embarks on a unique journey to control their apartment's heating system without altering the setup. Frustrated by the limitations of the landlord-installed thermostat, they venture into a tech-based solution using a replay attack. By capturing and replaying radio signals between the thermostat and the boiler, the author manages to automate the heating system using Home Assistant. This DIY approach sparked a conversation on Hacker News, where users discussed the technical creativity involved, along with ethical and legal concerns about transmitting on regulated frequencies. The debate highlighted the balance between innovation and responsibility in such tech hacks.

Next, we delve into a Prolog-based text adventure game on GitHub. This game challenges players to find hidden treasure in a castle using interactive mechanics like locked doors and hidden objects. Coded in SWI Prolog, it offers an engaging experience for fans of logic-based puzzles. The Hacker News community shared their thoughts, with some appreciating the game's educational value and others critiquing its coding quality. The discussion also touched on whether modern AI could enhance such games, reflecting nostalgia for text-based games and interest in Prolog as a learning tool.

We then shift our focus to Verus, a tool for verifying Rust code. This GitHub project provides developers a way to ensure code correctness without runtime checks. Verus is particularly useful for low-level systems, and the discussion on Hacker News compared it to other tools like Prusti and Creusot. While some users debated the necessity of additional verification given Rust's safety features, others praised Verus for its potential in critical system development. The ongoing dialogue considers whether Rust should integrate more built-in verification capabilities or rely on external tools like Verus.

Moving on, we uncover the story of the BBC MCR21, a pioneering outside broadcast van from 1963. The article highlights its restoration and historical significance, detailing its advanced technical setup for the time. In the comments, users reflected on the appreciation of vintage audio and video equipment, drawing parallels between past and present engineering marvels.

In another intriguing experiment, an author shares how they recreated the game Doom using SQL queries in the browser, leveraging DuckDB-WASM. This project showcases SQL's versatility beyond its typical use, with commenters praising the creativity and discussing similar SQL experiments. The conversation explored technical challenges and the potential of client-side databases, highlighting the tech community's love for unconventional projects.

We also revisit the past with "101 BASIC Computer Games" on GitHub, a collection of programs from the 1975 book by David Ahl. Nostalgia filled the comments as users shared their experiences learning programming through BASIC, discussing its simplicity and educational value. This project reminds many of the impact early programming resources had on their careers.

In startup news, Supabase has raised $200 million in a Series D funding round, reaching a $2 billion valuation. Known for its user-friendly backend services, Supabase offers an easy way to handle databases, akin to Firebase but focused on Postgres. While some users appreciate its simplicity, others express concerns about security and maintainability in quick projects. The debate centers on whether Supabase is suited for larger projects or remains a tool for smaller developments.

Finally, we spotlight Fujitsu and RIKEN's new 256-qubit superconducting quantum computer, a leap from their previous 64-qubit version. This advancement could tackle complex problems and is part of a hybrid quantum computing platform. Hacker News comments reflect excitement about potential applications in fields like finance and drug discovery, alongside discussions on the challenges of scaling qubit numbers.

That's all for today's episode. Thank you for tuning in to the Hacker News Daily Podcast. Stay curious and keep exploring the world of tech!
