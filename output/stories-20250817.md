Claudia is a new desktop app that helps developers work with Claude Code in a much easier and more visual way. The main idea is to replace the hard-to-use terminal commands with a clean, friendly interface for managing AI coding sessions.

The app lets you see all your Claude Code projects and sessions in one place, so you don’t have to remember lots of command-line steps. You can make custom AI agents with special prompts, and run them in a safe, separate space. The app also tracks how many tokens you use and how much you spend, showing clear charts so you don’t lose control of costs. If you like Markdown, Claudia has a built-in editor with live preview for system prompts. You can manage Claude’s servers visually, too, and even “time travel” by making checkpoints in your chat sessions—like using Git, but for conversations. Privacy is a big focus: all your data stays on your computer, with no cloud or outside tracking. Claudia is built with modern tools: Tauri 2.0 for native speed, React 18 for the UI, TypeScript and Rust for safe, fast code, and Tailwind CSS for nice looks. You can download Claudia for macOS and Linux now, with Windows support coming soon. To use it, you just install the app, make sure you have Claude Code CLI, and start managing your AI sessions in a visual way.

In the Hacker News comments, some developers liked the idea of having a GUI for Claude Code, saying the terminal gets messy for big projects. Others wondered if Claudia really adds value over just using a text editor and some scripts, especially since developers often prefer minimal tools. A few people were happy about the privacy-first approach, since many AI tools send data to the cloud. Some users said they wished Windows support was ready, since not everyone uses Mac or Linux. There were questions about how easy it is to make custom agents and how secure the sandboxing is. A few worried that adding a GUI could make things slower or more complex. Others were impressed by the tech stack, especially the use of Rust and Tauri for speed and safety. Some suggested adding more integrations with other tools, like GitHub, to make the app even more useful. Overall, people seemed interested, but wanted to see real-world use cases before switching from their current setup.

This article is about a software developer who moved from working at small companies and startups to a big enterprise and shares what that change felt like after one year. The writer talks about how things that are simple in small teams can become big, strange problems in a large company.

They explain that in big companies, it’s hard to find out who is in charge of a tool or system, and sometimes no one is. This leads to wasted time and tools that keep running even when nobody understands them. The article also says large companies often waste a lot of money on failed projects or unnecessary services, while at the same time denying small requests like a new mouse. In small teams, hiring is more careful, so bad hires don’t last long. But in big companies, people rarely get fired; instead, they stay, even if they are not good at their job. This creates a mix of coworkers with very different skill levels.

Urgency in big companies can be fake or real, and part of the job is learning the difference. Sometimes managers push fake urgency to look good, while real emergencies—like a broken connection—need real action. The writer describes “security theatre,” where success is measured by easy-to-track numbers instead of real safety, and everyone works to make the numbers look good. Job titles are confusing and often don’t mean much. Senior leaders avoid saying “I don’t know,” so they make the same mistakes again and again. Engineering teams are split into “empires” that do things very differently, which makes sharing good practices hard.

Even with all these strange things, the writer says there are good parts. There are more chances to learn, to teach others, to specialize, and to see your work used by many people. The pay is steady, and the team is more diverse.

In the Hacker News comments, many people agree with the writer’s observations about big companies. Some say they had the same problems—like not knowing who owns a tool, or seeing waste everywhere. Others point out that big companies can move slowly, but the pay and job security feel better. A few commenters think some problems are not just about size, but about leadership and company culture. Some defend big companies, saying there are positives that make up for the bad parts, like better benefits and more learning chances. Others share tips for surviving in a big company, such as finding good mentors and not stressing over things you can’t control.

A few people mention that small companies can also have their own problems, like low pay and less stability. Some say the “empire” problem happens in nearly every big company, but it’s possible to fix if leaders want to. Others feel that job titles and fake urgency are just part of corporate life everywhere. One commenter says it’s easy to get bitter, but important to look for the good things, just like the writer does in the end. Several agree that switching between small and big companies can help you understand what you prefer in your career.

## LL3M: Large Language 3D Modelers

- 原文链接: [LL3M: Large Language 3D Modelers](https://threedle.github.io/ll3m/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44930808)

LL3M is a tool that uses large language models to create and edit 3D models in Blender by writing Python code. You type what you want, and the tool makes shapes or changes them, step by step, using code that you can see and edit.

The process has three parts: first, LL3M makes a simple 3D shape from your text; next, it checks and fixes problems by itself; last, you can give more instructions to change things as you like. This makes it easy to keep improving your model, either automatically or with your help. LL3M can make detailed objects, like windmills with many parts or musical instruments with special keys. Every 3D object is made by code that is clear, with good names and comments, so you can read and change it. For example, you can ask LL3M to “make it steampunk style,” and it will change the look and shape of different hats to match your idea. You can also change small things, like the color or pattern on a knife blade, using easy-to-understand code in Blender.

LL3M lets you change your model many times, focusing only on the parts you want, and it keeps the rest the same. The code it makes uses the same patterns for many shapes, so you can reuse pieces or adjust how things are built. It can also make scenes with many objects and put them in the right places, using “parenting” so that moving one part moves connected parts too. This makes it easy to build complex models and scenes, and each part has a clear name in the code.

In the Hacker News comments, some developers are excited because LL3M opens 3D modeling to people who do not know Blender well or cannot code by hand. Others like that the code is easy to read and change, so you can learn from it or use it as a base for bigger projects. A few people think this could speed up work for artists, since they can quickly try out ideas and make changes without starting over. Some users wonder if the models are as good as ones made by experts, or if there are limits when you want very complex shapes. There are also questions about how easy it is to guide LL3M with just words, and if it might make mistakes that are hard to fix. One person points out that the clear code helps with this, since you can always change it yourself. Another commenter says this kind of tool is great for small studios or solo makers, because it saves time and lets you focus on design. Some are curious about how LL3M deals with big scenes, or if it slows down with lots of objects. There’s also talk about how this could help teach both coding and 3D modeling at the same time. Finally, a few people share ideas for new features, like making animations or working with other 3D programs, showing lots of interest in where LL3M could go next.

## ArchiveTeam has finished archiving all goo.gl short links

- 原文链接: [ArchiveTeam has finished archiving all goo.gl short links](https://tracker.archiveteam.org/goo-gl/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44933401)

ArchiveTeam has finished saving all the links that used Google’s goo.gl URL shortener, which Google shut down a few years ago. They did this to make sure that the web pages behind these short links are not lost forever.

To save these links, ArchiveTeam used a tool called the Warrior. Warrior is a virtual machine that anyone can run on their computer. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux. You just need to install a program like VirtualBox, download the Warrior appliance, and then start it. When it runs, it downloads web pages and uploads them to ArchiveTeam’s archive. Your computer’s safety is not at risk, but the process will use some internet and disk space. You can set up your Warrior easily by following their step-by-step guide: import the appliance into VirtualBox, start the machine, go to a special web page on your computer to set up your username, and pick which archiving project you want to help with. There is even a leaderboard to show how much you are helping. ArchiveTeam suggests choosing “ArchiveTeam’s Choice” so your Warrior helps with the most important projects.

In the Hacker News comments, many people thanked ArchiveTeam for saving internet history and explained why this work is important. Some said they use the Warrior to help with other archiving projects too. Others talked about how URL shorteners like goo.gl are risky, because if the service shuts down, all the short links can break and information can be lost. A few users shared that they lost access to old bookmarks when goo.gl stopped working. Some people discussed how easy it was to help ArchiveTeam by running the Warrior, and encouraged others to try it. A few worried about privacy, asking what kind of data is collected. Others pointed out that archiving is hard work and needs help from many volunteers. Some wished other services would get similar attention before they disappear. A few joked about strange old links they found. Overall, most agreed that saving these links helps keep important parts of the web alive for the future.

## Review of Anti-Aging Drugs

- 原文链接: [Review of Anti-Aging Drugs](https://scienceblog.com/joshmitteldorf/2025/08/17/review-of-anti-aging-drugs/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44933219)

This article reviews which drugs and supplements might help animals and people live longer. The writer looks at a big database of lifespan studies and explains that most life extension drugs only help a little, especially in mammals like mice or humans.

Most drugs gave mice about 10–20% longer lives, but these gains are much bigger in short-lived animals like worms and flies. The writer thinks this is because animals have a built-in program that controls their lifespan and can be stretched only so far—maybe up to 10 extra years for people at most. Some top drugs and supplements discussed include vitamin C, simvastatin, royal jelly, taurine, melatonin, NAC (N-acetylcysteine), berberine, rapamycin, and metformin. However, the writer points out that many studies are old, small, or hard to repeat, and sometimes the data does not match what the original studies found.

For example, vitamin C and vitamin E showed no real benefit or may even shorten life, even though some tables report a big gain. Royal jelly helped mice live longer, but mostly by stopping early deaths, not by making the maximum lifespan longer. Taurine, melatonin, and NAC look promising, but the right doses for humans are not clear. Metformin and rapamycin are widely used in studies, but results are mixed and only show small improvements. Some popular supplements, like CoQ10, NMN, and quercetin, had no positive effect.

The writer recommends melatonin, berberine, and NAC as safe choices, is cautious with rapamycin and selegiline, and personally takes anti-inflammatory supplements like curcumin and eats dark chocolate. He says that stacking many supplements probably will not give much more benefit and that diet and exercise are still the best ways to live longer.

Commenters on Hacker News had many opinions. Some are hopeful about new drugs or combinations and want more human studies. Others are skeptical, saying that animal results rarely match human results, and that small lifespan gains are not worth the risks or costs. Several readers agree with the article’s main point: diet and exercise matter more than pills. Some warn about side effects, like rapamycin’s immune suppression or the unclear long-term risks of anti-aging drugs. A few point out that healthy habits and social connections are linked to longer lives, not just supplements. Many want clearer evidence and better studies before trying anything new. Others share their own supplement routines or joke about chasing youth forever. Overall, the comments show a mix of hope, doubt, and careful interest in the science behind anti-aging drugs.

## Show HN: OverType – A Markdown WYSIWYG editor that's just a textarea

- 原文链接: [Show HN: OverType – A Markdown WYSIWYG editor that's just a textarea](item?id=44932651)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44932651)

This article introduces OverType, a simple Markdown editor that looks and feels like a regular text box. The main idea is to give users a What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) experience for Markdown without fancy tools or complex interfaces.

The author explains that OverType is just a plain HTML textarea with some clever JavaScript behind it. When you type Markdown, OverType shows you the formatted result right away. You don’t need to click preview or open another window. The editor updates as you type, making writing faster and easier.

OverType doesn’t add toolbars or buttons. You just type Markdown as normal, and the formatting appears in place. For example, if you type “**bold**,” it instantly looks bold. The editor supports basic Markdown features like headers, lists, bold, italics, links, and code blocks. It tries to keep things simple and avoid features that get in the user’s way.

The code is small and easy to read, so it can be included in other projects. The author made this because most WYSIWYG editors are complicated and slow. OverType is meant to be fast, lightweight, and easy to use.

Top comments on Hacker News say they like how lightweight and simple OverType is. Some users say they are tired of heavy editors that need lots of code just to write Markdown. One person says OverType is great for quick notes or blogs, but maybe not enough for complex documents. Another user says they like seeing live formatting but worry about confusing new users who don’t know Markdown. Someone asks if it works well on mobile, and the author replies that it does, but there could be more improvements. A few comments discuss how other Markdown editors compare, with some people preferring more features and others liking OverType’s minimal style. Some users share tips for making it even better, like adding dark mode or shortcuts. Overall, people like the focus on simplicity and speed, but agree it may not fit everyone’s needs.

## Investigation into 4chan and its compliance with duties to protect its users

- 原文链接: [Investigation into 4chan and its compliance with duties to protect its users](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/investigation-into-4chan-and-its-compliance-with-duties-to-protect-its-users-from-illegal-content)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44935107)

The article tells us that Ofcom, the UK’s media regulator, is investigating 4chan to check if it follows the new Online Safety Act rules. The main concern is whether 4chan protects its users from illegal content, and if it has responded properly to Ofcom’s requests for information.

Ofcom says 4chan did not answer a formal request asking for a record of how it checks for illegal content. Every site with user-to-user communication must do a risk assessment and keep a record of how they handle illegal content. These records should show that the site checks for risks like crime and harm, and show what steps they are taking to stop users from seeing or sharing illegal content. The rules also say websites must have clear terms of service, and these rules must explain how users are protected from illegal content. If a site like 4chan does not follow these rules, Ofcom can fine them a lot of money—up to £18 million, or 10% of their yearly worldwide revenue. If the problem is very serious, Ofcom can also ask the court to block the site in the UK or stop payment and ad services from working with it. Ofcom’s investigation is still happening, and they will share more news later.

In the comments, some people feel that making 4chan follow UK rules is hard, since 4chan is not a UK company and users can easily use VPNs to get around blocks. Others worry that strict rules might harm free speech or push websites out of the UK. Some think that sites like 4chan should be responsible for stopping illegal content, but others say it is almost impossible to check everything users post on big websites. A few commenters note that 4chan is famous for not having much moderation, so it is not surprising that Ofcom is worried. There are also questions about how these new rules will affect smaller websites that do not have big teams or lots of money. Some people argue that these laws might only help big companies, because they can afford to follow the rules. Others support Ofcom, saying that protecting people from illegal content is more important than site owners’ problems. There is also debate about whether blocking access really works, since people can find ways around it. Some commenters talk about privacy, saying that too much control could hurt users’ rights. Overall, the discussion is split between people who want more online safety and people who are afraid of too much control or censorship.

## Derivatives, Gradients, Jacobians and Hessians

- 原文链接: [Derivatives, Gradients, Jacobians and Hessians](https://blog.demofox.org/2025/08/16/derivatives-gradients-jacobians-and-hessians-oh-my/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44931666)

This article talks about four ideas from calculus: derivatives, gradients, Jacobians, and Hessians, and shows how they work together. These are tools for understanding how functions change, and they are important in math, programming, and machine learning.

A derivative tells you how a function changes at a certain point. For example, if you want to find the lowest point of a curve, the derivative can show you which direction to go—left or right. If the derivative is negative, you should go right; if it's positive, go left. When you reach a spot where the derivative is zero, you may have found a minimum or a maximum. For simple functions, you can solve for where the derivative is zero to find the minimum without guessing.

However, for more complex or higher-dimensional functions, things get tricky. Functions with more than one variable use gradients. A gradient is a list of all the partial derivatives, one for each variable. It shows the direction of the fastest increase. If you want to go downhill (to a minimum), you move in the opposite direction of the gradient. This idea is called gradient descent, which is used a lot in machine learning and optimization.

A Jacobian matrix is used when a function takes in several numbers and gives out several numbers. The Jacobian is a matrix that shows how each output changes with each input. It helps understand how space is stretched or squished by the function, and is important in machine learning and computer graphics.

The Hessian matrix is about second derivatives. It shows how the gradient itself changes. The Hessian can help you understand the curve of a function and is very useful for finding minimum points faster. For big problems, like those in machine learning, the Hessian can be slow to calculate, so people use faster, “quasi-Newton” methods.

In the comments, some readers liked how the article explains these ideas with simple examples and clear language. A few people shared their own ways to think about gradients and Hessians, such as imagining a hiker climbing hills or valleys. Others pointed out that in real-world data, it is easy to get stuck in places that are not true minimums, and this is why adding noise or momentum to gradient descent is helpful. Some readers explained that the Jacobian is not only about stretching, but also tells you if a transformation can be reversed. A few warned that calculating the Hessian for machine learning models is often impossible due to size, so tricks are needed. There were also comments about practical uses in graphics programming, and some shared links to visual tools that helped them learn. One reader asked about automatic differentiation, and others replied with libraries and resources. Some said they wish they had read such a clear explanation earlier in their studies. Finally, a few people debated the best way to teach these ideas, with suggestions for more visuals or physical analogies.

## The Oldest Mask in the World (Pre-Pottery Neolithic B)

- 原文链接: [The Oldest Mask in the World (Pre-Pottery Neolithic B)](https://www.imj.org.il/en/collections/334459-0)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44914362)

This article is about the oldest mask in the world, from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B period, shown by the Israel Museum. The mask is about 9,000 years old and made from limestone. 

The article explains that people made this mask long before there was pottery. The mask has large, round eyes, a small nose, and a mouth with teeth. There are holes along the sides, probably for tying the mask to a face or for hanging it. Experts think people wore the mask during rituals or ceremonies. The mask is life-sized and looks a bit scary or strange to modern eyes. The article says that masks like this may have been used to connect with spirits, honor dead people, or scare away evil. The mask was found in the Judean Desert, an area with many ancient sites. It is very rare, because not many masks from this age have survived. The museum says this mask gives us a window into the early minds of humans and their beliefs. It shows how important ritual and magic were, even before writing or cities. The article notes that studying these old objects helps us understand where we come from.

People in the comments on Hacker News are amazed at how old the mask is. Some wonder how people made such things with simple tools. Others talk about the meaning of the mask, asking if it was scary on purpose, or if it was meant to look like a real person. A few people say the big eyes remind them of modern art or cartoons. Some users discuss how hard it is to know what ancient people were thinking just by looking at old objects. Others share stories of seeing old masks in museums and feeling a connection to the past. A few people question if the holes really mean it was worn, or if they had another use. Some users point out that ancient art often looks strange because the culture was so different from ours. Overall, readers are interested and curious, and some hope to visit the museum one day to see the mask in person.
