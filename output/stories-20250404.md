- 原文链接: [New antibiotic that kills drug-resistant bacteria found in technician's garden](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00945-z)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43538853)

This article talks about a new antibiotic found in a garden. This new antibiotic can kill bacteria that do not die from other medicine.

The scientists found this antibiotic in soil from a garden. It is special because it attacks the bacteria in a new way. This means bacteria might not become resistant to it as quickly. The antibiotic targets something in the bacteria called the ribosome, which helps bacteria make proteins. Many bacteria are becoming resistant to current medicine, so finding new antibiotics is very important. In 2021, about 1.1 million people died because of resistant bacteria.

In the comments, people discuss the use of antibiotics in farming. Many think antibiotics should not be used on animals because it creates resistant bacteria. Some people worry that protests do not change things, while others believe protests can help people feel less alone. Many comments talk about the need to reduce meat consumption to help solve this problem. Some people also mention how hard it is to change people's habits. Others talk about how new antibiotics are not very profitable, so companies do not make them. Some people bring up the idea of using bacteriophages, which are viruses that attack bacteria, as an alternative. There is also a discussion about how capitalism affects the creation of new medicine.

## Gumroad is now open source

- 原文链接: [Gumroad is now open source](https://github.com/antiwork/gumroad)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43580103)

The article is about Gumroad becoming open source. This means people can see and use the code behind Gumroad on GitHub.

The main points are that the code is available, but it has a special license. The license says only small companies or government or non-profit groups can use it. If a company makes more than $1 million, they cannot use it anymore. This is different from traditional open source, which usually means anyone can use it freely.

People in the comments have different views. Some say the title is misleading because the license is not truly open source. They suggest calling it "source available" instead. Others worry about the restrictions if a company grows and the license ends. Some think Gumroad wants free help with coding by making the code public. There is also a discussion about the meaning of "open source" and how it differs from "free software." Some users remember Gumroad's past and their unique work culture. Others joke about using the code without a license by using AI.

## What is Local first development

- 原文链接: [What is Local first development](https://alexop.dev/posts/what-is-local-first-web-development/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43577285)

The article talks about "local-first web development." This method lets you use apps offline and keeps your data safe on your device, syncing it when you are online again.

The main points are that local-first development gives users control over their data and lets them use apps without needing an internet connection. Traditional web apps rely on servers, which can cause problems like slow loading and losing access when offline. Local-first apps fix these issues by allowing immediate access to data, working offline, and ensuring data is secure and private. They are good for apps like text editors and calendars, but not for banking or shopping, where centralized data is needed. Sync-enabled apps can automatically update data across devices, but developing these apps can be challenging due to data conflicts when syncing.

In the comments, some people think the title is confusing. They say local-first is not a new idea, and apps have worked offline for years. Others say syncing data is still hard, especially when multiple users edit the same content. Some suggest using CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) to help with syncing, but it's still not perfect. A few people joke about old software being called new and revolutionary. Others discuss how offline apps can be harder to develop and ask how to charge users if they can use the app offline without paying. Some believe local-first is more complex but necessary for areas with poor internet, while others think it is not worth the effort.

## Why do we need modules at all? (2011)

- 原文链接: [Why do we need modules at all? (2011)](https://groups.google.com/g/erlang-programming/c/LKLesmrss2k)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43554444)

This article is about a discussion on whether programming needs modules, which are parts of a program that group functions together. The writer, Joe Armstrong, thinks modules might not be necessary and suggests a new way of organizing functions.

Main points from the article:
- Joe Armstrong suggests removing modules and having all functions with unique names stored in a global database.
- He thinks this can make sharing and finding functions easier.
- Modules can help organize code and decide what parts of the code are hidden or visible.
- Joe says choosing which module a function belongs to can be hard and might not always be useful.

People in the comments have different opinions:
- Some say modules help keep code organized and make sure only necessary parts are exposed to others.
- Others say having all functions in one place without modules would be confusing and make finding the right function harder.
- Some people think modules help with preventing code errors and make changes safer.
- A few commenters suggest that instead of removing modules, we should improve how we categorize and search for functions.
- Modules and namespaces (another way to organize code) are seen as important for big projects to manage complexity.
- One person says modules are important for team collaboration and version control.
- A new idea is to use tags or categories to organize code instead of strict module structures.
