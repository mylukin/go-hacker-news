## Amazon Just Happens to Hold Book Sale During Independent Bookstore Day

- 原文链接: [Amazon Just Happens to Hold Book Sale During Independent Bookstore Day](https://gizmodo.com/amazon-just-happens-to-hold-book-sale-during-independent-bookstore-day-2000594958)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43808334)

Amazon is holding a book sale on the same day as Independent Bookstore Day. The timing has sparked discussions about whether this was intentional or just a coincidence. Many people didn't even know Independent Bookstore Day was a thing before reading about it in headlines. Some feel that Amazon might not have planned this overlap, considering the day isn't widely recognized.

The article highlights how Amazon's sale could hurt independent bookstores by drawing customers away with lower prices and faster shipping. Amazon's influence in the book market is significant, and their ability to offer cheap prices and quick delivery often overshadows the unique value of local bookstores. However, some argue that independent bookstores offer community value that Amazon can't match, like curated selections and events.

In the comments, many people express skepticism that Amazon targeted the event intentionally, suggesting the overlap might just be a business decision without malice. Others point out that while Amazon's prices and delivery are hard to beat, the company also faces criticism for its environmental impact and its role in diminishing small businesses. Some commenters highlight alternative ways to support local bookstores, like using Bookshop.org, while others note that they continue to use Amazon for convenience and selection.

## Anatomy of a SQL Engine

- 原文链接: [Anatomy of a SQL Engine](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-04-25-sql-engine-anatomy/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43807593)

The article discusses how a SQL engine works, using Dolt's SQL engine as an example. It explains the steps that a SQL engine takes when processing a query, from parsing to execution. The engine starts by parsing the query to create a structured abstract syntax tree (AST). Then, it goes through binding, where the fields in the AST are matched to the database symbols. The engine simplifies the plan, explores possible execution plans, and finally executes the query, spooling the results back to the client.

Parsing involves creating an AST, which checks if the query is well-formed. Dolt's engine uses a left-recursive parser, which is efficient but complex. Binding matches the AST to the database schema, ensuring that all references are correct. The plan simplification phase optimizes the query to make it faster to execute. Plan exploration and costing help find the most efficient way to execute the query, considering different join types and orderings. Finally, the execution phase runs the query and returns the results.

In the comments, users shared various opinions and insights. Some suggested trying to build a simple SQL engine yourself to understand how query planning and execution work. Others mentioned tools like sqlglot and Apache Calcite for parsing and visualizing SQL queries. One user noted that the article provides a comprehensive overview of SQL query execution stages, useful even if you're not specifically interested in Dolt. There was also a light-hearted discussion about how people pronounce "SQL," with some preferring "sequel" and others using "ess queue ell" or even "squirrel." Lastly, a user shared that Grafana uses Dolt's go-mysql-server for SQL expressions, highlighting its flexibility in handling different data sources.

## Mesmerizing Interlocking Geometric Patterns Produced with Japanese Woodworking

- 原文链接: [Mesmerizing Interlocking Geometric Patterns Produced with Japanese Woodworking](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/see-the-mesmerizing-interlocking-geometric-patterns-produced-with-this-ancient-japanese-woodworking-technique-180986494/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43810724)

The article is about Japanese woodworking, focusing on creating mesmerizing interlocking geometric patterns. This traditional craft, known as Kumiko, involves assembling small wooden pieces without nails or glue to form intricate designs.

The article explains how Kumiko is a delicate and precise art form. Craftsmen use specialized tools to cut wood into small pieces, which are then fitted together. The process requires great skill and patience, as each piece must fit perfectly. Historically, these patterns were used in traditional Japanese architecture, such as in screens and transoms. The appeal of Kumiko lies in its ability to transform simple wood into complex, beautiful art.

In the Hacker News comments, users shared their appreciation and experiences. One user mentioned visiting a craft fair and feeling inspired. Another user recommended trying Kumiko kits for a hands-on experience, linking to products available online. Some commenters compared Kumiko to Islamic Mashrabiya screens, noting the potential for modern patterns using technology like laser cutters. Others discussed the idea of mass production, with some arguing that the charm of Kumiko is in its handmade nature, which would be lost if mass-produced. A few users shared their interest in creating similar projects, like lamps or lanterns, and noted the challenges of making these pieces, especially in terms of cutting and assembly. Finally, some users highlighted the cultural value and personal choice involved in integrating more handmade art into daily life.
