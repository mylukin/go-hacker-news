Hello everyone, this is the 2026-02-27 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have many interesting stories to share with you, from quitting Google to new AI investments, problems with JavaScript Streams, space missions, and more.

First, let's talk about one person's experience leaving Google's services like Gmail and Search. The writer said Google adds more AI and more ads, and they felt they were losing control and privacy. So, they switched from Gmail to Proton, and found their inbox became much cleaner. They now think more about who gets their email address, and say there are many good Gmail alternatives, such as Fastmail and Tuta. For searching the web, they use Brave and DuckDuckGo instead of Google, and enjoy "surfing the web" again, just like in the old days.

The writer also feels better for supporting fewer big tech companies, even if it does not change the world. They think most people use Google just because it’s the default, not because they really choose it. Google pays a lot to be the default search on phones and browsers, which makes it hard to switch. The article reminds us that "free" services are not really free—we pay with our data and privacy. The writer thinks paying for good services is worth it, but notes that many alternatives also have free versions. The only Google service they still use is YouTube, which is hard to leave because no other platform has so many creators.

Looking at the top Hacker News comments, many people agree that Google’s products, especially search and Gmail, have gotten worse. Some say they switched to Proton or Fastmail and are happier. Others like DuckDuckGo or Kagi for search. Some still use Google for things like maps or very specific questions. People say leaving Google is hard if your friends or work use it, and that habits keep us using default tools. Some warn that other big tech companies, like Apple or Microsoft, also have privacy problems. Most agree that paying for good services is smarter than using "free" ones full of ads, but it takes effort to switch and learn new habits.

Next, we move to big news in AI: OpenAI has just raised 110 billion dollars, and now the company is valued at 730 billion. This is a huge number for an AI company, and shows how much people believe in OpenAI and its technology. OpenAI is famous for ChatGPT and other AI tools. Big investors want to join because they think AI will change the world. With this money, OpenAI can hire more people, buy more computers, and build better AI models. The new value is near the level of the largest tech companies, even though OpenAI is much younger. Some people worry that so much money will make OpenAI focus too much on profit and forget its mission. Others think OpenAI will now compete even harder with Google, Microsoft, and other AI companies. The article also explains that OpenAI has both a nonprofit and a for-profit side, which can cause problems inside.

In the comments, some people are shocked by the high valuation. They think it is too much for a young company. Others believe AI is the future, so the price makes sense. Some worry that with so much money, OpenAI could lose its focus on safety. There are also worries about pressure to make money quickly. Some users compare this to tech bubbles in the past, like the dot-com boom, and say it will now be harder for small startups to compete. Many agree this will push other companies to invest more in AI too. Some hope OpenAI will use the money for good, while others are not sure. A few are simply excited to see what new tools OpenAI will make.

Now, let's look at robotics. The article discusses why robots still cannot use their hands as well as humans. Robots are good at simple, repeating actions, but struggle with tasks that need many careful moves, like folding clothes or handling soft things. The main reason is robots need to sense and react in real time, but it’s very hard for them to understand touch and adjust quickly. Teaching a robot by showing it once does not work for complex tasks, because every object is different. Robots need good fingers and sensors, but building these is expensive and hard. Software alone is not enough; the hardware must also improve.

The article shares that companies and researchers are making progress, but real-world use is still slow. Easy tasks for people, like cooking or stacking odd-shaped boxes, are very hard for robots. The "deadlock" is that robots cannot get better without more data, but they cannot get data because they do not work well yet.

In the Hacker News comments, people agree that robot hands are still too slow and clumsy for most jobs. Some say robots are good at moving boxes, but not fine details. A few think we should focus on making robots do things humans cannot, instead of copying the human hand. Some are hopeful that better AI and cheaper sensors will help robots soon. But others note the high cost, and share that robots often break or get confused when things change. Many agree mixing software and hardware improvements is needed, and while progress is slow, robotics is getting better.

Next, we have a technical article about JavaScript Streams API, called Web Streams. The writer says the current API is too complex, slow, and hard to use. Web Streams was made before JavaScript had async iteration, so it uses special readers, locks, and controllers, which makes working with data harder and causes bugs. Features like BYOB are very complex and rarely used. Backpressure, which should control data flow, often does not work in practice. The API creates too many promises, making streams much slower than simpler designs.

Real-world problems include leaked connections, memory issues, and slow server-side rendering. Every major runtime has had to make custom fixes, but this leads to more confusion. The writer proposes a new API using async iterables. This removes special classes and locks, and lets streams be simple sequences you can loop over. The new design is pull-based, faster, and easier to use. Benchmarks show the new API can be 2 to 120 times faster.

In the comments, many users agree the current API is too hard to use and has too much boilerplate. Some say they make mistakes with locks or BYOB reads. Others say the API should not make the easy case hard. A few defend the old API for security and cross-platform reasons. Some share their own workarounds or libraries, and others worry about breaking old code with a new API. Most agree streams are important and the API should match how developers write JavaScript today.

Now, let's look at space news. NASA is slowing down its Artemis program because of safety problems and delays. Artemis is NASA’s project to send people back to the Moon and later to Mars. NASA found issues with the rockets and Orion capsule, which could be unsafe. Some parts are not working as expected, and testing takes longer. NASA is checking everything again to keep astronauts safe. Because of this, the next Artemis mission will be delayed. NASA is also looking at how money is spent and how to work better with private companies.

In the comments, many people say NASA is right to focus on safety, even if it means waiting. Some compare NASA’s slow process to private companies like SpaceX, which move faster but take more risks. Some are sad about the delay, while others say it’s better to wait than risk an accident. There are comments about NASA’s large budget, too much paperwork, and hopes that private companies can help speed things up. Many remember past NASA missions and say delays are normal. Overall, there is support and frustration with NASA’s careful way.

Next is an article about running untrusted code safely using sandbox isolation. It explains Docker, gVisor, microVMs, and WebAssembly, and how each gives different levels of isolation. Docker uses Linux namespaces, but all containers share the same kernel, so a kernel bug can harm all containers. Cgroups limit resources but do not protect against attacks. gVisor uses a user-space kernel to catch most system calls, so attacks are harder. MicroVMs use hardware virtualization, giving each workload its own small VM and kernel—very strong but slower. WebAssembly is even more limited, not allowing system calls at all.

Each method has trade-offs: namespaces and cgroups are fast but weak, microVMs are slow but strong, gVisor and WASM are in the middle. The choice depends on your needs. The article warns that using Docker does not mean you are safe if the code is untrusted. For local sandboxing, new Apple frameworks give each container its own lightweight VM, safer than Docker on Mac.

In the comments, many agree with the main points. Some say most developers wrongly think Docker gives strong security. Others point out kernel bugs can break all isolation. Some like gVisor's balance, but note its overhead. MicroVMs are strong but slow and use more memory. People discuss that WebAssembly is safe and fast, but not ready for all uses yet. There is talk about the importance of network controls, and real-world stories of security problems. Some like the new Apple framework for local development. Others warn that adding layers can make debugging harder and slower. Most agree: if you run untrusted code, you must trade speed for safety, and this field is changing quickly as more AI agents and cloud platforms run user code.

Now, some sad news: Dan Simmons, the author of the science fiction classic "Hyperion," has died. He was born in Illinois, loved stories from a young age, and first worked as a schoolteacher. He used creative activities and long stories in his classes, one of which became the "Hyperion" series. His first novel won a big award, and in 1987, he became a full-time writer.

Dan wrote over thirty books in many styles—science fiction, horror, crime, and history. His books won many awards, and "The Terror" was made into a TV show. He was known for writing what he loved, not following normal rules, and for teaching and sharing with others. He is survived by his family.

On Hacker News, many people shared how much Dan Simmons’ books meant to them. Some said "Hyperion" was their favorite story ever. Others were inspired to become writers after reading his work. Some liked that he mixed different genres and made original stories. A few met him at book events and said he was kind. Many expressed sadness and thanks for the stories he gave the world.

Next, there is a new law in California: every operating system must check the age of users. This is to protect kids online. Companies like Apple, Google, and Microsoft must add age checks when someone sets up a device, not just on websites or apps. If they do not follow, they can be fined. The law also tries to limit data collection from children and give parents more control. But tech companies are worried, because it is hard to know a user's real age, and the law could make things harder for everyone. Some people fear more privacy problems if companies start asking for IDs or personal data. The law will start soon, so companies must make changes quickly.

In the comments, many people think this law is a bad idea. Some say it will not protect kids but just annoy adults. Others worry about privacy and having to share more personal info. A few say kids will find ways around any system. Some agree the internet is dangerous for kids, but do not think this law is the answer. Others worry it will hurt small companies and open source projects. There are also worries that this kind of law could spread. A few support more parental controls, but most comments are critical.

Moving on, there’s a story about writing a guide for SDF fonts, which help fonts look good with effects like outlines and shadows. The author started learning about SDF fonts while working on games, wrote some notes, and then noticed these notes were ranking high in search results, even though they were not good. So, they decided to write a better and clearer page, focusing on one library, msdfgen. They made diagrams and tests, and then shifted to a step-by-step guide with JavaScript code. After more work, they started over again to focus on the main ideas and removed extra details. After a year, they are happy with the new guide and hope it will help others.

In the comments, people praise the author’s honesty about the messy process. Some found the original notes helpful and liked real-world examples. There are discussions about library choices, atlas size, smoothing, and making SDF fonts work on different devices. Some wish the guide covered more libraries; others like the focus on one. Many are glad the author shared both successes and struggles, making the topic easier for others.

Finally, there is a new tool that helps you recover files made or changed by Claude Code, even if you lost them or forgot where they are. It reads the logs Claude keeps in your computer, finds all steps where files were written or edited, and lets you bring back any version. The tool is fast, supports point-in-time recovery, and has a simple text interface for browsing, searching, and exporting files. You can see differences between versions, recover deleted files, and use keyboard shortcuts. Some people in the comments think this tool is very useful, especially for heavy Claude Code users. Others did not know Claude kept such detailed logs and wonder about privacy and disk space. Some suggest similar tools for other AI coding assistants. There are also comments about the technical choices, wishing for a web interface or an even easier install process. Most agree it solves a real problem in a smart way and are glad it is open source.

That wraps up today’s episode. Thank you for listening to Hacker News Daily Podcast. We hope you found these stories interesting and helpful. See you next time!
