- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45684134)

Claude just launched a new memory feature for teams at work. This helps Claude remember your projects, preferences, and past conversations, so you don’t have to repeat yourself every time.

The memory feature is now available for users with Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise plans. Each project gets its own separate memory, so details from one project won’t mix with another. You can see, edit, or delete what Claude remembers, and you can even have “Incognito” chats that don’t save anything to memory. Before releasing memory, the team tested it for safety, checking for problems like reinforcing bad patterns or letting users bypass safety rules. They made adjustments to make sure memory is useful but also safe.

Claude’s memory helps with things like keeping track of client needs, remembering project details, and following your team’s workflow. Executives, sales, and product teams can all use it to keep context across many projects. Admins in companies can turn off memory if they want. The memory is optional, so users can turn it on or off and control what’s saved. You can also import or export your memory from Claude or other AI tools.

If you want a private chat, you can use Incognito mode, which won’t save anything to memory or chat history. This is good for sensitive topics or brainstorming. The company says they’re being careful with how memory is used and tested, starting with teams in work settings before expanding.

Many top comments on Hacker News like the idea of AI tools remembering context. Some users say it will save time and make AI more helpful for real work. Others are concerned about privacy, especially if sensitive data is stored in the AI’s memory. Some developers worry about company secrets or mistakes being remembered and shared in the wrong context. A few people are happy to see clear controls for editing and deleting memories. There’s also debate about whether Incognito mode is really private, or if data could still be saved somewhere. Some ask if the feature is useful enough to pay for higher-priced plans. Others suggest better ways to export or migrate data between AI assistants. Overall, people see potential but want strong privacy, safety, and control over the AI’s memory.

## Can "second life" EV batteries work as grid-scale energy storage?

- 原文链接: [Can "second life" EV batteries work as grid-scale energy storage?](https://www.volts.wtf/p/can-second-life-ev-batteries-work)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45685007)

This article is about using old electric vehicle (EV) batteries for big energy storage on the power grid before recycling them. Redwood Materials, a company known for recycling batteries, has started a new project to put these used EV batteries together and use them as storage for solar power and data centers.

The main idea is that when an EV battery is too weak for a car, it still has a lot of life left. These batteries are strong, made for tough conditions, and have lots of capacity. Redwood is not taking the batteries apart; they use the whole battery pack as it is. They built a special “universal translator” box so many different battery types can work together, even if they come from different cars or have different chemistries.

Redwood’s pilot project in Nevada uses 20 megawatts of solar panels and 63 megawatt-hours of these old batteries to power data centers. They say the main challenge was making all the different batteries “talk” to the same system, but their software team solved it. Most batteries are accepted for reuse—more than 90%—and they only need a simple test to check if the battery is still good enough.

Using these batteries for storage can be even more valuable than just recycling the metals inside. The company says this method can be cheaper than building new battery storage from scratch. The process is also fast: they built a fully working plant in just four months. Safety is important, so batteries are spaced out to reduce fire risk, and if one battery fails, it doesn’t affect the others.

Redwood can use almost any EV battery, and their system works for both small and large projects. They are already seeing a big increase in the number of used batteries coming in as more EVs reach end-of-life. The company is open to different business models—sometimes they will own and run the storage site, sometimes others will, but Redwood always wants to recycle the battery at the end.

In the Hacker News comments, some users were excited about reducing waste and giving batteries a second life. Others were worried about the logistics: moving heavy batteries, managing different types, and the cost of handling. A few doubted if second-life batteries could ever compete with new ones as battery prices keep dropping. Some people asked if the added complexity is worth it, and if safety could be a problem.

There were also positive comments about the “universal translator” idea, saying it’s a smart software solution. Several users liked the idea of off-grid data centers and fast deployment, while others wondered about land use and if these battery fields could work in cities. Some pointed out that using used batteries helps with the current shortage of new batteries and raw materials. Finally, a few commenters hoped more companies would design batteries that are easier to reuse and recycle in the future.

## Date bug in Rust-based coreutils affects Ubuntu 25.10 automatic updates

- 原文链接: [Date bug in Rust-based coreutils affects Ubuntu 25.10 automatic updates](https://lwn.net/Articles/1043103/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45686919)

A bug in the Rust-based "date" command in Ubuntu 25.10 stopped some computers from doing automatic updates. This bug only affects systems using a new version of core utilities written in Rust, not the usual manual update commands.

The problem was found in cloud servers, containers, desktops, and servers running Ubuntu 25.10. If your system has the "rust-coreutils" package version 0.2.2-0ubuntu2 or earlier, you might have this bug. They fixed it in version 0.2.2-0ubuntu2.1, so updating your package solves the problem. Manual updates using the "apt" command still work fine. Ubuntu started using Rust-based tools like "uutils" and "sudo-rs" in this release. Their goal is to see if Rust tools are good for the next big Ubuntu release. Before this, most core utilities were written in C, and now they want to "oxidize" (move to Rust) for better safety and security.

One commenter joked about the next Ubuntu release name and said moving old C tools to Rust is good for the long term, but short-term problems are expected. Another person said they are happy Ubuntu is trying this, even though it is scary, and they think it is brave to make such a big change. A different comment explained that Ubuntu is still using the old GNU (C) tools for commands that can cause big problems, like copying or deleting files. They think Ubuntu should switch everything to Rust sooner, so any big bugs are found before the next important release. This person also listed other technical problems in the Rust tools, like issues with signal handling and too many ways to do one thing. They hope the project does well but warn that it needs careful management.

One user said automatic updates are not important for experts and that most big security problems on servers are not fixed quickly anyway. They also question if Rust really brings benefits for skilled coders, or if it is just a new trend.

Overall, some people support Ubuntu’s move to Rust for safer code, while others worry about bugs and if the change is worth it. Many agree that big changes like this will always have problems at first. Some trust that testing will help find and fix the issues before Rust tools are used everywhere.

## Zram Performance Analysis

- 原文链接: [Zram Performance Analysis](https://notes.xeome.dev/notes/Zram)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45686280)

This article looks at how well different compression algorithms work with Zram, a Linux tool that saves memory by compressing swap data. The author tests algorithms like lzo, lzo-rle, lz4, and zstd, and checks how fast they are, how much space they save, and how much delay they add.

The article shows big tables with test results on different systems, including a Raspberry Pi 4. LZ4 is the fastest, giving high throughput and low latency, but zstd gives the best compression ratio, meaning it saves the most space. The tests also look at a setting called “page-cluster.” Setting this to zero means Zram reads just one page from swap at a time; higher numbers mean reading more pages at once. Smaller values give lower delays (latency), but may lead to more reads if the data is used again soon.

The author uses a weighted formula to rate the best choice, giving 40% each to latency and compression ratio, and 20% to throughput. LZ4 with page-cluster 0 comes out on top for most cases, but zstd is best if you want the most compression. When compiling code on a Raspberry Pi, LZ4 is also a bit faster than zstd.

The article says zstd is a good default for most users, especially if the data in swap is old and not used much (like old browser tabs). But if your system swaps a lot and needs speed, LZ4 is better. Also, zstd decompresses slower, so it’s best to keep page-cluster at zero for that. The default value for page-cluster is 3, but this is from before SSDs were common and may not be the best for modern systems.

In the comment section, some users agree that zstd is a strong choice for desktops and laptops, since it fits more data in memory and swap is mostly for stale data. Others point out that in low-memory or server setups, latency matters more, so LZ4 is safer. A few people mention that changing page-cluster can have unexpected effects depending on how often swap is used, and they prefer to test on their own workloads. One commenter says that even though zstd gives great compression, the slower decompression can be a problem if you switch apps often. Another user adds that SSDs and faster storage can make some of these tuning details less important, but for Raspberry Pi and older laptops, it’s still useful.

Some developers thank the author for sharing real numbers instead of just opinions. A few ask for more details about the test setup or wonder how these results change with different types of data. There’s also talk about how Linux distributions pick their defaults, and if they should update them for newer hardware. One person points out that ChromeOS already uses zstd with page-cluster=0, showing that this advice matches industry practice. Others say they wish there were more easy tools to help regular users tune Zram settings without editing system files.

## New updates and more access to Google Earth AI

- 原文链接: [New updates and more access to Google Earth AI](https://blog.google/technology/research/new-updates-and-more-access-to-google-earth-ai/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45684155)

Google has announced new updates and wider access to its Earth AI, a tool that uses AI and satellite data to help with real-world problems like disasters and environmental monitoring. The article explains that Earth AI now uses Gemini’s advanced reasoning to connect different data sources—like weather, population, and satellite images—to answer complex questions quickly.

Earth AI helps groups such as cities, companies, and nonprofits make smart decisions, for example, by predicting floods, wildfires, or air quality problems. For instance, in the 2025 California wildfires, Google sent crisis alerts to 15 million people, showing shelter locations in Maps. The new “Geospatial Reasoning” framework lets Earth AI combine many kinds of data, so it’s easier to see which people or places are most at risk during disasters. A nonprofit called GiveDirectly uses this to target aid after floods by finding the most vulnerable areas.

Google Earth now also has new AI models, letting users ask questions and get quick answers from maps or satellite pictures. For example, a water company can see if a river has dried up or if there are harmful algae blooms that might affect the water supply. Some features are first available to U.S. users with professional or AI Pro accounts, but Google plans to expand access.

Earth AI is being tested by many groups. WHO Africa uses it to predict cholera risk by mixing local and AI data. Companies like Planet and Airbus use it to check for deforestation or for plants growing too close to power lines. An insurance company uses it to get fast hurricane predictions, helping people get claims paid sooner. Google is also making these AI tools available on Google Cloud, so businesses can use their own data together with Google’s models.

In the Hacker News comments, some users are excited about the ways Earth AI can help with disaster response and environmental health. They say it’s good that these powerful tools are being shared more widely. Others worry about privacy, asking if personal data could be exposed or misused. Some think the AI’s results could be biased or hard to trust without more openness about the models. There are technical questions too—like how people can test or audit the AI’s predictions, and if smaller groups will get real access or if it’s mostly for big companies. A few users wish the tools were fully open source, so anyone could improve or check them. Others point out that while the tech is promising, it’s only helpful if local governments and groups can actually use the data in time. Some also worry about costs, saying that “Pro” or “Cloud” features might be too expensive for smaller nonprofits or individuals. Overall, many are hopeful but want more details on access, accuracy, and privacy.

## I Managed to Grow Countable Yeast Colonies

- 原文链接: [I Managed to Grow Countable Yeast Colonies](https://chillphysicsenjoyer.substack.com/p/i-managed-to-grow-countable-yeast)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45584500)

This article talks about growing yeast at home to find the best way to count yeast colonies for small science experiments. The author tried different levels of yeast in water to see which one would give just enough colonies to count easily, but not so many that it was impossible.

First, they made a strong yeast mix called the “stock solution,” but it grew too many colonies to count. Next, they tried a 1:10 mix, but it got contaminated and did not work. Then, the 1:100 mix worked, but there were still a lot of colonies and it was hard to count them all. The 1:1000 mix turned out just right, with a good number of colonies that could be counted easily. The 1:10000 mix had too few colonies and was not useful. The author plans to use the 1:1000 mix in their next step, where they will test how much UV light kills the yeast. They thank a friend for help and say they like doing science at home because it can be fun and useful, even with simple tools.

In the comments, some people are excited to see science done at home and say it is a great way to learn. Others give tips about keeping things clean to avoid contamination, which is a big problem in home labs. Some readers ask about the kinds of yeast used and if the results would be the same with other types. A few mention safety, saying you should be careful when working with living things and UV light. One person shares their own story about trying to grow bacteria and how hard it was to get only a few colonies. Others talk about how this kind of work can help teach kids about science. Some people think the experiment is simple, but still very important for learning the basics. One commenter asks if the method could be used to test other things, like how well soap or sanitizer works. A few people remember doing similar things in school and feel happy to see it again. Another person points out that doing these tests can help people trust science more. Some just thank the author for sharing the pictures and results, saying it makes them want to try their own experiments at home.

- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45639618)

Pyscripter is a free, open-source Python IDE for Windows that is lightweight but has many features. It is special because it is made using Delphi (Pascal), not Python or C++.

The IDE gives you tools to write, run, and debug Python code. It supports features like syntax highlighting, code completion, debugging, and even supports modern Python tools. Pyscripter has a simple user interface, but still includes advanced features that you find in commercial IDEs. You can inspect variables, see call stacks, and use refactoring tools. There is support for multiple Python interpreters, and you can run scripts interactively. Recently, Pyscripter added features for AI-assisted coding using large language models. The IDE is open-source under the MIT license, so anyone can use or change it. The project is active, with regular updates and several contributors.

In the Hacker News comments, some people are surprised that Pyscripter is written in Delphi. A few users say this makes the IDE very fast and small, but they worry about limited support on other platforms like Linux or Mac. Others mention that Pyscripter was one of the first good IDEs for Python on Windows, and it helped many people learn Python. Some users say they prefer other editors like VS Code or PyCharm now, but they respect the work behind Pyscripter. A few suggest that using Delphi is both a strength and a weakness: it gives good performance but might make it harder to get new contributors. There is also talk about the IDE’s simple look and how it can be less distracting than bigger editors. Some people ask if Pyscripter could ever run on other operating systems, but most agree it is very good for Windows users. Overall, the comments show respect for the project and its history in the Python community.

## What happened to Apple's legendary attention to detail?

- 原文链接: [What happened to Apple's legendary attention to detail?](https://blog.johnozbay.com/what-happened-to-apples-attention-to-detail.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45685551)

This article talks about how Apple used to care a lot about small details, but now many of their products feel broken and messy. The writer shares examples to show that Apple’s design and user experience have gotten much worse, especially with iOS 26 and recent Mac OS updates.

First, the author mentions privacy popups in the Reminders app that keep asking for location permission, making it hard to use the app. Even after updating Mac OS, these annoying popups stay. Notifications are also distracting and badly designed. The search bar keeps moving around in different Apple apps, so users have to look for it every time. Tab designs are not the same in different apps, which makes things confusing.

When talking about iOS 26, the author gives more examples. In the Files app, folder names are missing and some buttons are hard to see, especially in dark mode. After updating, the share sheet (where you share files and images) is broken, with missing or invisible icons. Changing accessibility settings makes some things better but breaks others. There are also big black bars that won’t go away in apps like Reminders. On the iPad, folder designs are messy and don’t work right.

Browsers are a big problem too. Apple forces all browsers to use WebKit, but WebKit has many bugs in iOS 26. For example, in Safari, buttons flash strangely, content scrolls behind the clock and buttons, and popups are cut off. Switching tabs now takes more steps and shows strange flashing colors. In-app browsers are even more broken, with important parts of the screen becoming unreachable.

The author also points out that Apple’s apps no longer line up their designs, making things look unprofessional. In iMessages, new background images make text hard to read. The App Library sometimes does not show app icons at all. The writer feels that Apple now cares more about showing off shiny new looks, like the “liquid glass” effect, instead of making things work well and be easy for everyone to use. This new style also makes battery life worse, especially for smaller iPhones, and hurts accessibility.

In the Hacker News comments, many people agree that Apple’s attention to detail has dropped. Some say they see more bugs and bad design in new updates. A few share their own stories about broken features, like the search bar being hard to find or icons missing. Some users think Apple focuses too much on adding new features instead of making sure old features still work well. Others feel that Apple’s large size and focus on profits have made them less careful about quality.

A few commenters defend Apple and say that all big software has bugs, and Apple still does better than many other companies. Some say that changes in design are normal as technology and tastes change, and not everyone will like the same things. Others point out that Apple products still work well for most users, and only power users or developers notice the details.

Some people think that the move to yearly big updates is part of the problem, because there’s not enough time for careful testing. Others feel that Apple spends too much time on marketing and not enough on real user needs. A few mention that Apple’s push for privacy and security sometimes leads to annoying popups or warnings, but these are meant to protect users. In the end, most commenters agree that Apple’s design and quality are not as good as they used to be, and hope the company will listen to feedback and improve.

## Kaitai Struct: declarative binary format parsing language

- 原文链接: [Kaitai Struct: declarative binary format parsing language](https://kaitai.io/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45580795)

Kaitai Struct is a tool that helps you describe and read binary file formats using a simple language. Instead of writing hard, error-prone code to parse binary files, you can write a description once, then use it in many programming languages.

The idea is to write a `.ksy` file that describes the structure of your binary data. Kaitai Struct has a compiler (`ksc`) that turns this description into code for languages like C++, Python, Java, Go, Rust, and more. This generated code lets you easily read or work with binary files, like GIF images or network packets, in your chosen language. The article shows an example of describing a GIF file header, then using generated code in different languages to read image size from a GIF file. Kaitai Struct offers small runtime libraries for each supported language, so the generated code stays easy to use. The tool is open source and free, and you can install it on Linux, macOS, or Windows. You can also build it from source if you want. There is a growing library of ready-made format descriptions you can use, including formats for popular tools like mitmproxy and Kismet. The license for the compiler is GPL, but the runtime libraries use more permissive licenses like MIT or Apache.

In the comments, many people say Kaitai Struct saves a lot of time compared to writing custom parsers by hand. Some users like that it helps keep code clear and reduces bugs, especially when reverse-engineering old file formats. Others point out that it is helpful for learning how file formats work, since the descriptions are easy to read. Some say the tool can generate code for many languages, which is great for cross-platform projects. However, a few users mention that for very complex or changing formats, manual code might still be needed. Some wish the generated code was easier to customize or use with special file layouts. There are also comments about the GPL license on the main compiler, which could be a problem for some companies, but most runtime code is MIT-licensed. A few people compare Kaitai Struct to older tools like Flex/Bison or to similar projects, and some share tips for using Kaitai Struct with their own projects. Overall, the community seems to think Kaitai Struct is a useful and practical tool for anyone dealing with binary formats.

## I spent a year making an ASN.1 compiler in D

- 原文链接: [I spent a year making an ASN.1 compiler in D](https://bradley.chatha.dev/blog/dlang-propaganda/asn1-compiler-in-d/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45681200)

The article is about someone who spent a year building an ASN.1 compiler in the D programming language, mainly for fun and learning. ASN.1 is a complex data description language used in many important places, like TLS certificates.

The author explains that ASN.1 has both a special notation for describing data and several ways to encode that data, such as DER (used in security) and others like BER, CER, PER, XER, and JER. ASN.1 is very flexible but also very complicated, with many rules and confusing syntax, especially because the standards have changed and old features get deprecated. The writer had to read multiple hard-to-understand documents (x.680, x.681, x.682, and x.683) and found most of them difficult or even impossible to follow.

One interesting part of ASN.1 is its constraint system, where you can write rules for your data (like "age must be between 0 and 120") directly in the definition. Another nice feature is the versioning system with unique object identifiers, which helps avoid naming problems.

The D language made code generation easier because of features like static imports, module-local lookups, trailing commas, and metaprogramming tools like mixin templates and typeof(). These allowed the author to be a bit "lazy" and write code that is simpler and safer. D's metaprogramming also helped in building the AST and IR nodes for the compiler, making some things much easier than in languages like C++.

However, there were many pain points. The ASN.1 syntax is often ambiguous and hard to parse. Important information is scattered across many documents, making it hard to find out how things should really work. Some features, like "ANY DEFINED BY," are especially confusing or outdated. The author had to implement certain checks and constraints three separate times: for type checking, for validating values, and for code generation. They also struggled with making IR nodes immutable and with the overall complexity—sometimes, ASN.1 feels like "all or nothing." Writing a compiler in general is slow and sometimes boring work, with lots of small differences between many similar pieces of code.

In the comment section, many readers share sympathy for the author's struggle, saying that ASN.1 is indeed painful and confusing. Some people mention using ASN.1 in their own jobs, often because they had to, not because they wanted to. A few readers highlight that ASN.1 is powerful and useful for certain problems, especially in telecoms and security, but the learning curve and complexity are very high. Some commenters note that the D language features described are interesting and make the process easier, while others wonder if using a different language would help. There’s debate about whether ASN.1’s design is brilliant or over-engineered for most real-world use. Others share their own horror stories about reading the ASN.1 specs or trying to maintain old ASN.1 code. Some readers ask about open-source ASN.1 tools, and a few thank the author for documenting their journey so carefully, saying it will help others who face similar challenges. Overall, the commenters agree that ASN.1 is a tough but important subject, and they appreciate the humor and honesty in the article.
