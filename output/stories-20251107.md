## Myna: Monospace typeface designed for symbol-heavy programming languages

- 原文链接: [Myna: Monospace typeface designed for symbol-heavy programming languages](https://github.com/sayyadirfanali/Myna)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45849342)

Myna is a new monospace font made for programmers who use lots of symbols in their code. The font tries to make symbols look as important as letters, so code is easier to read and write. Myna was created because the author wanted better-looking symbols, like arrows, dollar signs, and others, which often look odd or out of place in most coding fonts. 

The font gives special care to symbols used in many languages, for example Perl, Haskell, C, and more. It tries to align multi-character symbols, like "->" or "::", so they look neat and connected. Each symbol gets a balanced weight, so they are easy to see but not distracting. The shapes are simple and modern, and common problems—like mixing up "1", "l", "I", or "0", "O", "o"—are fixed. Myna is available in a single style for now, but the author may add more if people ask for it. The font works in most editors and terminals, and can be installed on Linux, macOS, or Windows. 

Myna started as a custom version of another font (Source Code Pro), but now it also includes ideas from other popular coding fonts like Fira Mono and Inconsolata. The author is open to bug reports and feature requests, and the font is free under the SIL Open Font License. There are example images for different languages, and the font tries to support some non-ASCII symbols too.

In the Hacker News comments, many people liked the focus on symbols, saying that code with lots of operators often looks messy in other fonts. Some users pointed out that clear and unique shapes for each symbol are very helpful, especially in languages like Haskell or Perl. Others praised the attempt to fix common confusion between similar-looking glyphs. A few people asked for more weights or italics, saying they need those for their workflows. Some users wanted real ligatures (where two or more characters join into one symbol), but others preferred the simple ASCII look. There were comments about the font's balance between modern design and readability, with some saying it looks clean, while others said it still needs polish. A few users noted that font choice is very personal, and what works for one person might not work for another. Some people shared their own favorite coding fonts and compared features. Lastly, some users reported small issues with spacing or rendering and suggested improvements for the next version.

## Ruby Solved My Problem

- 原文链接: [Ruby Solved My Problem](https://newsletter.masilotti.com/p/ruby-already-solved-my-problem)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45849528)

This article is about a Ruby developer who learned that Ruby already had a built-in way to compare app version numbers, solving a problem he’d been working on. He shares how he first wrote his own Ruby class to handle version checking for his Hotwire Native app, but then learned in a community call that Ruby’s standard library already includes `Gem::Version` for exactly this purpose.

The author describes how his original class, `AppVersion`, took a string like "1.2.3", split it into major, minor, and patch numbers, and let him compare versions. He used this to control features in his app based on version. But during his monthly “Hotwire Native Office Hours” Zoom session, another developer pointed out `Gem::Version`. This built-in Ruby class can take version strings, including pre-release tags like "beta", and compare them easily. The author shows simple examples using `Gem::Version` in the Ruby console: for example, "1.2.3" is greater than "1.2.2", "2.0" is greater than "1.2.2", and even "2.0" is greater than "2.0.b1". 

The big advantage is that `Gem::Version` is standard and tested, so it is less likely to have bugs. The author immediately replaced his custom code with this built-in solution. He says this experience makes him wonder what other features Ruby or Rails already has that he doesn’t know about. He also shares how important community is—by running workshops and coffee meetups, he learns new things and meets other Ruby developers. These events, even if small, help people connect and sometimes lead to new job opportunities.

In the Hacker News comments, many people agreed that it’s common to write code for a problem, only to later find out the language already has a solution. Some praised the author’s openness to learning and sharing. Others pointed out that reading the documentation or exploring the standard library can save time and prevent bugs. A few shared their own stories where they made custom tools only to discover built-in alternatives later. Some commenters said it’s fine to write your own code for learning, but using proven libraries is best for real projects. There was also advice to talk more with other developers, since community discussions often reveal useful things like this. A few reminded that built-in solutions are often more tested and handle edge cases better than homegrown code. Others joked about “reinventing the wheel,” but said everyone does it sometimes. Some commenters shared links to other lesser-known Ruby features, encouraging readers to dig deeper into the language’s capabilities. Overall, people appreciated the author’s community focus and the reminder to both explore the standard library and connect with others.

## How did I get here?

- 原文链接: [How did I get here?](https://how-did-i-get-here.net/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45850382)

This article explains how your computer’s data moves across the Internet to reach a website, using a tool called traceroute. The author made a website that shows you the path your data takes, and built a custom traceroute program for it.

The traceroute starts at your computer, goes through your router and Internet provider, and then to the server hosting the website. Some routers do not answer traceroute requests, so the path may look incomplete. The author’s tool, called ktr, sends special packets (ICMP) with a “time to live” (TTL) value. Each router reduces the TTL by one, and when it reaches zero, the router sends back an error. By sending many packets with increasing TTL, the tool can find out which routers your data passes through.

The author explains that their website runs a traceroute from the server to your computer, then reverses the path to show what it might look like going the other way. This is not perfect because data may take a different route back, but it gives a close idea.

Internet paths go through “autonomous systems” (AS), which are groups of networks owned by companies or organizations. Each AS has a number (ASN) and connects to others based on deals between companies. The tool finds out which AS owns each IP address along the path using public databases like WHOIS and PeeringDB, but this is tricky because the data is not always in the same format.

Routers at the edges of these ASes use a protocol called BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) to share information about which networks they can reach. BGP has changed over time but still runs much of the Internet today. Routers decide the best path for your data based on the information shared through BGP.

The article ends with the author reflecting on their goal to help people understand how the Internet works, sharing open source code, and encouraging others to explore.

In the comment section, many people say they love the website and find the visual traceroute very fun and educational. Some users share memories of using traceroute tools when learning about networking. Others point out that showing the path in reverse can be confusing, and explain the technical reasons why paths may not be the same in both directions. A few users discuss the challenges of parsing WHOIS data, agreeing with the author that it is messy and inconsistent.

Several readers praise the author’s use of CSS to show results updating live without JavaScript, calling it a clever workaround. Some commenters are excited to see the source code is open and want to use or improve the traceroute tool themselves. One user notes that running traceroute from the server is different from running it from the client, and talks about privacy concerns.

Others appreciate the history lesson about BGP and how the Internet’s structure depends on business deals between companies. Some wish the article went even deeper into Internet politics, while others say it’s already a great introduction for beginners. Overall, most comments are positive, saying the article and site help make a complex topic easy and fun to understand.

## Ribir: Non-intrusive GUI framework for Rust/WASM

- 原文链接: [Ribir: Non-intrusive GUI framework for Rust/WASM](https://github.com/RibirX/Ribir)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45850671)

Ribir is a new GUI framework for Rust and WebAssembly (WASM) that wants to make building apps for desktop and web easier. It lets you write your app’s logic once and run it on Linux, Windows, macOS, and the web, with mobile support planned for later.

Ribir calls itself “non-intrusive,” meaning you do not have to change your data or logic much to use it. If your app data changes, Ribir will only update the parts of the UI that need changing. You can write your UI with normal Rust code, using macros for a more declarative style if you like, but you don’t have to. There is an example in the README showing a counter app in just a few lines. You can also build your UI without these macros, using plain Rust.

The framework uses a widget system. You can create widgets in different ways: by composing other widgets, by drawing and laying out things yourself, or by controlling how a parent and child work together. Ribir also brings a theme system, so you can switch how parts of your app look at runtime. It has a painter that turns your views into 2D shapes, and it uses a GPU backend for fast drawing, with support for wgpu by default.

There is an event system that allows for bubbling and capturing events, but you only use it if you want. Text input and basic widgets are there, but the docs say they are still “rough” and may change. The layout system is inspired by Flutter but is not the same. The project is MIT-licensed and open source.

In the comments, some people are excited to see another Rust GUI framework and like Ribir’s approach of not forcing you to change your data. Others say it looks promising but wonder why there are so many Rust GUI projects and if any will become popular. Some users are glad to see WASM/web support and think this is a good direction for cross-platform apps.

A few people ask if the widget library is stable enough for real apps. Others compare Ribir to Dioxus, Iced, and other Rust GUI options, noting differences in style and features. Someone points out that the “rough” state of widgets and missing mobile support could be a problem for now. There is praise for the clear documentation and the simple counter example. Some think the “non-intrusive” idea could help avoid common problems with other frameworks. A few commenters are hopeful about the future but want to see more real-world apps built with it. Overall, the mood is curious and supportive, but cautious about using Ribir in production today.

## YouTube Removes Windows 11 Bypass Tutorials, Claims 'Risk of Physical Harm'

- 原文链接: [YouTube Removes Windows 11 Bypass Tutorials, Claims 'Risk of Physical Harm'](https://news.itsfoss.com/youtube-removes-windows-11-bypass-tutorials/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45850963)

YouTube took down videos that showed how to bypass Windows 11 requirements, saying these tutorials could cause “physical harm or death.” The videos were from the CyberCPU Tech channel and explained how to install Windows 11 on unsupported hardware or with a local account. After being removed, the channel received strikes, and the creator appealed. Both appeals were denied very quickly—one in 45 minutes, the other in just five minutes.

At first, the creator thought this was just a mistake by YouTube’s AI moderation. Later, he wondered if Microsoft pressured YouTube to remove the videos. But YouTube later restored both videos, saying the actions were not because of automation. This is confusing because the reason for the takedown was very strong—claiming risk of death for an OS tutorial. The article says that automated moderation systems often fail to tell safe content from dangerous content, especially with tech topics. It points out that while these systems are supposed to keep people safe, they can remove helpful tutorials for no good reason, while real spam sometimes stays online. The author thinks that human review is needed for these tricky cases, and that big tech companies’ reliance on AI moderation is not working well.

Hacker News commenters had a lot to say. Some people were upset that YouTube called these videos dangerous, saying it is an overreaction. They think teaching people how to use their own computers is not a real risk. Others pointed out that YouTube is probably trying to avoid any legal trouble, even if the risk is very small. There were comments about how automated moderation often gets things wrong and that appeals seem useless if a human does not really look at the case. A few said that Microsoft might want these bypass videos gone, but most people blamed YouTube’s own rules and algorithms. Some users shared their own stories about having videos or posts removed for strange reasons. A few worried that this kind of moderation makes it hard to share tech knowledge online. Others joked about what “physical harm” could happen from installing Windows 11 on old hardware. Overall, most people agreed that the takedown was too strict and that platforms need better ways to handle tech content.

## Venn Diagram for 7 Sets

- 原文链接: [Venn Diagram for 7 Sets](https://moebio.com/research/sevensets/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45809007)

This article talks about a Venn diagram made for 7 different sets, each with its own color. The author wanted every area of the diagram to look the same size, so no color or set was more important than the others.

The diagram uses 7 colors chosen to be evenly spaced around the color wheel, not the exact ones Isaac Newton used for his color studies. Each color has a name taken from a list on Wikipedia. The diagram is interactive—you can spin it and see two different sides, almost like a 3D object or a mandala.

The author says he was inspired by Newton’s ideas about light and color. Instead of using numbers or letters to show each set, he picked colors to make it easy to see the overlaps. When you mix these 7 colors in all possible ways, you get 128 different color combinations in the diagram.

The diagram also keeps the same shape (“topology”) as a famous earlier 7-set Venn diagram but tries to make every part feel balanced and playful. The author wanted people to explore, drag, and have fun with it.

In the comments, some people are impressed by how hard it is to make a Venn diagram for 7 sets look clear and balanced. Others remember how even drawing 3 or 4 sets in school was tricky, and this takes it to a whole new level.

One person says the colors make it easier to read than using numbers or letters. Another mentions that beyond 7 sets, it’s almost impossible to make a good Venn diagram, and the shapes get too complex to understand.

A few commenters discuss the math behind Venn diagrams and how each extra set doubles the number of regions. Someone points out that this kind of diagram is not just for fun—it’s useful for showing all possible overlaps in data or logic problems.

Some people wish the author shared the code or math used to build the diagram. Others just enjoy the playful look and the way it becomes like art. A few worry that with so many colors, it can be hard for people with color blindness to see the differences. Someone else suggests that interactive diagrams like this are a great way to get students interested in math and logic.

## I Love OCaml

- 原文链接: [I Love OCaml](https://mccd.space/posts/ocaml-the-worlds-best/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45846517)

This article talks about why the author really enjoys using OCaml, a programming language that is not very popular today. The writer explains that, although not perfect, OCaml has many good features that make programming easier and more fun.

The author shares their journey with different programming languages. They started with Haskell, a functional language, and liked its focus on breaking big problems into smaller parts and its strong static type system. These features helped the author think more clearly and work faster, but Haskell’s complex features, slow compile times, and tricky bugs made it hard to use, especially when working with other people’s code.

Next, the author tried Go, a much simpler language. Go was easy to understand, compiled fast, and had good tools and documentation. But Go was too simple in some ways—the error handling was wordy, there were no null checks, and it was easy to make bugs. The author also missed features from functional programming, like pattern matching and sum types.

Based on these experiences, the author made a list of things they want in a programming language: fast compile times, simple runtime, strong types, functional features, good speed, and good documentation. OCaml, they say, has all these things. The language has strong types, simple runtime, fast compilation (even faster than Go), can build single static binaries, and has great documentation tools like odig and utop. OCaml’s type inference means you don’t need to write types everywhere, but you can still use interface files to keep things clear. The author feels OCaml strikes a good balance between being simple and expressive.

The author admits OCaml has some old or unnecessary features, like object-oriented parts, and some libraries can be too complex, but overall, the language is well-designed and pleasant to use.

In the Hacker News comments, many people agree that OCaml is a great language with strong types, good performance, and nice features, but they wish it was more popular. Some say OCaml’s syntax is unusual, and the French influence can be confusing for new users. Others point out that OCaml’s ecosystem is smaller than languages like Rust or Go, which makes it harder to find libraries or community help. 

A few commenters talk about the lack of big companies using OCaml, which means fewer job opportunities and less motivation for people to learn it. Some users say the build tools and package management in OCaml have gotten much better in recent years, making it easier to use for real projects. Others wish OCaml would modernize its syntax or improve some old parts, but still think it’s a strong choice for people who like functional programming.

One person shares that they switched to OCaml after using Haskell and found it simpler and more practical for everyday work. Another mentions that ReasonML and ReScript, which are based on OCaml, help bring OCaml ideas to new communities, like JavaScript developers. Some warn that OCaml’s object-oriented features can be confusing and are best avoided. Overall, commenters see OCaml as a hidden gem, but note it still faces challenges in getting more users and companies to adopt it.

## James Watson has died

- 原文链接: [James Watson has died](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/07/science/james-watson-dead.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45850069)

James Watson, the scientist who helped discover the structure of DNA, has died. He was well known for his work with Francis Crick in the 1950s, which changed biology forever.

Watson and Crick found out that DNA is shaped like a double helix. Their discovery explained how genetic information is passed from one generation to the next. They used data from Rosalind Franklin’s X-ray images, which helped them see DNA’s shape. This breakthrough led to many new ideas in genetics and medicine. Watson won the Nobel Prize in 1962, along with Crick and Maurice Wilkins, for this work. After that, Watson worked on more genetics research and led the Human Genome Project for a while. He also worked in science education and wrote books about DNA.

But Watson’s life was not only about science. He made statements in later years that many people found offensive and racist. Because of this, he lost many honors and jobs. Some people felt his comments hurt his reputation and legacy.

In the comments, many people thanked Watson for his work on DNA and said it changed their lives and careers. Some said the double helix discovery was one of the biggest moments in science. Others talked about Rosalind Franklin’s role, saying she did not get enough credit for her work. Some people discussed Watson’s controversial statements, and said they could not separate the science from his words. A few said it is important to remember both the good and bad parts of his life. Others asked if we should judge scientists only by their work, or also by their personal actions. Some felt sad about his death but said it is right to talk about everything he did. Many agreed that Watson’s discovery was very important, but his personal behavior made his story complicated.

## Leaving Meta and PyTorch

- 原文链接: [Leaving Meta and PyTorch](https://soumith.ch/blog/2025-11-06-leaving-meta-and-pytorch.md.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45843948)

This post is from Soumith Chintala, the creator and longtime leader of PyTorch, announcing he is leaving Meta and the PyTorch project after more than a decade. He explains that after building PyTorch into a key tool for AI—used in big companies, classrooms, and research—he feels it’s time to try something new, even if it’s small and uncertain.

Soumith shares how hard it is to leave such a big role, especially when PyTorch is so important in AI today. He feels proud that PyTorch now supports very large models and is used everywhere. He points out that making tools easier to use and more open was always his dream, and he believes that dream has come true. Even though there is still more work to do, he thinks the project can move forward without him.

He’s careful to explain that PyTorch is in good hands. He lists many team members and explains why he trusts them. The current team is experienced and shares the same values that made PyTorch successful. For example, some team members have backgrounds in open-source and have shown strong technical and personal leadership. Soumith says that, compared to earlier years, the team now solves problems on their own and doesn’t need his help as much.

Looking back, Soumith describes the early days at Meta and FAIR (Facebook AI Research) as magical and productive. He talks about the fun he had working with talented people on projects like GANs, Starcraft bots, and the first FAIR cluster. He shares personal struggles, like feeling impostor syndrome at the start and being helped by good mentors. He also remembers the joy of meeting PyTorch users whose research and lives were changed by the tool.

He thanks many people at Meta and in the PyTorch community. He also credits Meta leaders for supporting open-source, which he says was key to PyTorch’s success. He ends by saying he will still be around, maybe filing issues and staying involved, but is ready for a new chapter.

In the Hacker News comments, many people thank Soumith for his work and say PyTorch changed their careers or research. Some users share their own stories of switching from other tools to PyTorch and how much easier it made their work. A few discuss fears about the project’s future without Soumith, but others say that open-source projects often continue to grow with new leaders. Some compare Soumith’s leaving to when other famous leaders, like Guido van Rossum or Linus Torvalds, stepped back from their projects and say it’s healthy not to be tied to one thing forever.

Several commenters praise the open and friendly tone of Soumith’s post, saying it shows real care for the community. Others discuss the importance of open-source for AI progress and hope Meta keeps supporting PyTorch. One or two ask what Soumith’s next project might be and wish him luck. Overall, the mood is thankful and hopeful about PyTorch’s future.

## VLC's Jean-Baptiste Kempf Receives the European SFS Award 2025

- 原文链接: [VLC's Jean-Baptiste Kempf Receives the European SFS Award 2025](https://fsfe.org/news/2025/news-20251107-01.en.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45850751)

Jean-Baptiste Kempf won the European SFS Award 2025 for his work on VLC Media Player. This award honors people who help Free Software grow in Europe.

VLC started in 1996 as a small student project to solve a simple problem. The first version was just a network streaming tool. Over time, it became a powerful media player used by billions of people on many devices and systems—Windows, Mac, Linux, phones, and more. Kempf joined the project as a student in 2000. When the original team left, he kept working and saved VLC from dying. He brought in new developers and made sure the project stayed alive and healthy. He also started a non-profit, VideoLAN, so the software would always belong to the community. There is even a company, VideoLabs, to help with development. VLC is famous for playing almost any video or audio file. Many people say it was their first Free Software, even on non-free systems like Windows or Mac. VLC’s symbol is a traffic cone, chosen for fun by the original students. Kempf always refused big offers to sell VLC or put in ads, because he cares about user freedom, not money. In 2018, France made him a Chevalier de l’Ordre National du Mérite for his Free Software work.

Commenters on Hacker News say VLC is often one of the first things they install on a new computer. People like that it is simple, fast, and works everywhere. Many thank Kempf and the VLC team for keeping it free and not filling it with ads or bloat. Some share stories about using VLC on very old computers, or for strange video files that nothing else could play. A few point out that VLC’s support for many formats is because of FFmpeg, another Free Software project. Others say the traffic cone logo is part of why VLC is so memorable and friendly. Some wish more big software projects followed VLC’s example—staying open, community-driven, and not chasing profit. There are also comments about the importance of community work and how rare it is to see such dedication. A few people wonder what’s next for VLC and hope it keeps its spirit. Many agree Kempf deserves the award, and thank him for years of great software.
