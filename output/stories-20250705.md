## Local-first software (2019)

- 原文链接: [Local-first software (2019)](https://www.inkandswitch.com/essay/local-first/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44473135)

This article is about "local-first software," which is a way to give people full control over their data, even as they use cloud-like features such as real-time collaboration. The main idea is that, while cloud apps like Google Docs make sharing and working together easy, they take away true ownership of your files.

The article explains that in cloud apps, your work is stored on someone else’s computer (the server), so you lose control if the service changes, shuts down, or blocks your access. In contrast, old-style apps stored files on your own computer, letting you do anything you want with them—even if the internet is down or the app company disappears.

Local-first software is meant to combine the best of both worlds. It keeps the main copy of your data on your device and only uses servers to sync with other devices or help with sharing. The article lists seven ideals for local-first apps: being fast, working across devices, working offline, easy collaboration, long-term access, security and privacy, and user control.

The piece reviews how current tech stacks (like Google Docs, Dropbox, Git, Firebase, CouchDB) meet or fail these goals. Most existing apps only meet some of them. Cloud apps are great at collaboration but bad at privacy, control, and offline work. File-based and Git apps are strong on control and long-term access but weak at real-time collaboration.

The authors suggest that new technology, especially CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types), can help. CRDTs let multiple people edit the same document, even offline, and merge changes later without conflicts. They built prototypes (like Trellis for Kanban boards and Pixelpusher for drawing) to test these ideas. They found that it works well—offline use is smooth, merging changes is usually easy, and users feel more in control.

However, challenges remain, such as managing large change histories and networking between devices. Servers may still help with backup and sharing, but they shouldn’t be the “owners” of your data. The article calls for more research, better tools, and new startups to make local-first software practical.

In the Hacker News comments, many readers liked the vision of local-first software. Some said they missed the control and speed of old apps, and they worried about losing their work if a cloud service is shut down or changes its rules. Others wrote about how hard it is to build apps that are both collaborative and privacy-friendly, since syncing and conflict resolution are tough problems.

A few commenters pointed out how most web apps today are built for the company’s needs, not the user’s. Some shared stories of losing access to important files when a service closed. Others talked about how tools like Git give programmers more control, but it’s not so user-friendly for non-coders.

There was debate about whether regular users want the responsibility of handling their own data and backups. Some people said users prefer convenience, even if it means less control, while others argued that with good design, local-first can be both easy and safe.

Several developers shared their own projects trying to solve these problems or mentioned open source tools that could help. There was excitement about CRDTs and peer-to-peer syncing, but also doubt about whether these are ready for big, mainstream apps. Some noted that companies may not want to give up data control, since it weakens their business models.

In general, the comments showed hope for local-first software, but also recognized the technical and business challenges ahead. Many agreed that for creative professionals, and for important personal work, having real ownership and long-term access to data is worth the extra effort.

## Cod Have Been Shrinking for Decades, Scientists Say They've Solved Mystery

- 原文链接: [Cod Have Been Shrinking for Decades, Scientists Say They've Solved Mystery](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/these-cod-have-been-shrinking-dramatically-for-decades-now-scientists-say-theyve-solved-the-mystery-180986920/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44474759)

Scientists have noticed that cod fish are getting smaller over the years. The article explains why this is happening and what it means for fishing and the ocean.

Researchers studied cod in the Atlantic Ocean. They found that cod used to be much bigger, but now most are smaller and lighter. For years, people thought this was only because too many cod were being caught. But the new research says there is more to the story. Scientists say that when fishermen catch the biggest cod, the smaller fish are the ones left to grow and make more babies. Over time, this makes the whole population smaller. This process is called “fishing-induced evolution.” It means fishing changes how fish grow, not just how many there are.

The article also says that smaller cod have fewer babies and may be weaker against changes in the environment. This could make it harder for cod numbers to recover. The scientists used old records and new computer models to study this. They say if fishing rules do not change, cod might keep getting smaller.

In the Hacker News comments, some people agree with the scientists and say this is an important finding. They talk about how fishing rules should help protect bigger fish so cod populations can get strong again. Others say this is not just about fishing—climate change and pollution are also hurting cod. Some users wonder if the same thing is happening to other fish, not just cod. A few people are worried that it might be too late to fix the problem. There are also comments about people eating less fish or choosing fish from better-managed sources. Some say this is another example of humans changing nature, often in ways we do not expect. Others argue that smarter fishing and better rules could help cod recover over time. A few users mention that new technology could help track fish and set better limits. Some commenters share hope that if we act soon, cod could grow bigger again in the future.

## Europe's first geostationary sounder satellite is launched

- 原文链接: [Europe's first geostationary sounder satellite is launched](https://www.eumetsat.int/europes-first-geostationary-sounder-satellite-launched)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44472992)

Europe has just launched its first geostationary sounder satellite, called the Meteosat Third Generation Sounder 1 (MTG-S1). This new satellite aims to help Europe better predict and prepare for extreme weather events like storms, floods, and heatwaves. MTG-S1 will give weather services in Europe faster and more detailed data about the atmosphere, including temperature, humidity, and certain gases. With this data, experts can spot signs of bad weather sooner, give longer warnings, and help keep people and property safe.

The satellite sits high above the equator in a special orbit, so it always watches the same area. It can scan the air over Europe, Africa, and nearby regions every 30 minutes, using an infrared sounder. This means it can see changes in the sky before clouds even form, which is very useful for early storm warnings. MTG-S1 also carries a device to check for pollution and gases in the air, which is important for public health and for watching events like wildfires or volcanoes.

The mission is a big team effort, involving EUMETSAT (Europe’s weather satellite agency), the European Space Agency, the European Union, and many partners. Experts say this launch is a strong example of European cooperation and will help make weather forecasts more accurate and give people more time to respond to dangers. The data will also help link weather, air quality, and climate models, and support long-term studies about how the climate is changing.

In the top comments, some users are excited about the new technology and say it’s a big step for Europe. Others point out that the US and Japan have had similar satellites for some time, but agree it’s important for Europe to have its own. There is interest in how open the data will be, with some hoping that scientists and the public can use it freely. A few users discuss the technical challenges of building and operating such a complex satellite, and they praise the teams who made it possible.

Some commenters talk about the value of better weather forecasts for safety and planning, especially as weather gets more extreme. Others wonder how the new data will be used in apps or by local weather services. A few people ask about the costs and funding, and if this investment will bring good returns. There are questions about how the satellite will work with other European weather programs and if more satellites like this are planned in the future. Finally, some users simply share their excitement at seeing Europe make progress in space technology.

## Atomic "Bomb" Ring from KiX (1947)

- 原文链接: [Atomic "Bomb" Ring from KiX (1947)](https://toytales.ca/atomic-bomb-ring-from-kix-1947/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44447797)

In 1947, KiX cereal gave away an "Atomic Bomb Ring" to kids who sent in 15 cents and a cereal box top. The ring was designed to look like a bomb and included a secret compartment and a tiny scientific gadget called a spinthariscope.

The band of the ring was gold-colored, with pictures of explosions on the sides. On top, there was a small metal warhead with a red plastic tailfin, which could be removed to reveal a hidden space for secret messages. The main feature was the spinthariscope inside the warhead. If you looked through it in a dark room, you could see tiny flashes of light. These flashes happened because the ring contained a little bit of radioactive polonium. The polonium sent out alpha particles, which hit a zinc sulfide screen inside the ring and caused it to sparkle.

At the time, ads said the ring was safe and the atomic material was harmless, even though today, people understand the dangers of radiation. The polonium used in the ring has a half-life of 140 days, so any rings left now are no longer active and can't show the glowing effect.

People in the comments had many reactions. Some were amazed that a radioactive toy was once given to kids and joked about how much times have changed. Others pointed out that back then, many things—like clocks and watches—used small amounts of radioactive material. A few commenters worried about the possible health risks, but most agreed the amount in the ring was very small. Some people remembered similar toys from their childhoods and felt nostalgic. Others thought it was a sign of how excited and curious people were about science and atomic energy after World War II. There were also comments about how clever and creative old cereal prizes used to be, compared to today’s toys. Some thought it was strange and a bit scary to mix kids and radioactive materials, while others saw it as an interesting piece of history. A few even mentioned wanting to buy one out of curiosity or as a collector’s item.

## Holding Cellphone while driving is illegal, California court rules

- 原文链接: [Holding Cellphone while driving is illegal, California court rules](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-06-05/holding-your-cell-to-navigate-while-driving-is-illegal-court-says)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44475352)

A California court has ruled that holding your cellphone while driving, even just to look at a map for navigation, is illegal. The court says the law is meant to stop distracted driving, so it covers more than just texting or calling—it also includes looking at maps if the phone is in your hand.

The case started when a driver got a ticket for holding his phone while following GPS directions. He argued that he was not “using” the phone, just looking at the screen. An earlier court agreed with him, but this new ruling reverses that, saying the law is clear: if you’re holding your phone while driving, you’re breaking the law, no matter what you are doing on it. The only exception is if your phone is mounted and you only swipe once to use it. The law was updated in 2016, after lawmakers saw that phones were used for many things, not just talking or texting. They wanted to include all actions that could distract drivers. So now, even just holding the phone to look at a map, play a game, or browse the web is not allowed.

Some people in the comment section agree with the court. They think this is good for safety and say that even a quick look at the phone can be dangerous. Others say the rule goes too far. They argue that sometimes you need to check directions or that some cars don’t have built-in GPS systems. A few people worry this will lead to more police stops or tickets for drivers who aren’t really being unsafe. Some suggest that the law should focus on real distractions, not just holding a phone. There are also comments about how technology in cars can be just as distracting as phones, but those are still allowed. Others point out that car makers should make better hands-free options. In short, there is a big split: some think this law will save lives, while others think it will cause problems for regular drivers.

## Speeding up PostgreSQL dump/restore snapshots

- 原文链接: [Speeding up PostgreSQL dump/restore snapshots](https://xata.io/blog/behind-the-scenes-speeding-up-pgstream-snapshots-for-postgresql)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44473888)

This article talks about how the team made pgstream, a PostgreSQL replication tool, much faster at taking and restoring database snapshots. Snapshots are needed to copy a whole database quickly and reliably, especially before starting data replication.

pgstream helps move data and schema changes from one Postgres database to another. It can also send data to Elasticsearch, webhooks, and lets you change columns during copying (for example, to hide private data). For snapshots, pgstream first gets the schema, then copies it to the target, reads rows from the source, and finally writes them to the target. At first, pgstream used standard tools like pg_dump and pg_restore for schema work, and its own code for reading and writing data. It read data in parallel using a special method (ctid) to make copying faster, and it could split up the work for big tables.

But performance was still slow compared to pg_dump/pg_restore, especially during the writing step. The team found that their write process was made for small, ongoing changes, not for big, one-time loads. To fix this, they switched from single-row inserts to using PostgreSQL’s COPY FROM method, which is much quicker for bulk data. They also delayed creating indexes and constraints until after all the data was loaded, just like pg_restore does, to avoid extra slowdowns. Another small but helpful tweak was to batch data by size, not just row count, for more predictable speed and memory use.

After these changes, pgstream could beat or match pg_dump/pg_restore in speed, while still offering extra features like column transformations. The article includes benchmarks with real datasets showing these gains.

In the Hacker News comments, many readers liked the detailed explanation and the open-source approach. Some people asked why not just use pg_dump/pg_restore for all cases, and others pointed out that pgstream’s extra features (like column changes or webhook support) make it useful for special needs. A few users worried about the complexity of supporting schema changes during replication, but others said it’s very helpful in real-world migrations. Several users shared tips about speeding up PostgreSQL loads in general, like always using COPY, disabling indexes, and careful batching. Some asked for more detailed performance numbers, and a few suggested that the team look at other fast database tools for more ideas. Overall, the audience liked the focus on practical, simple solutions and sharing lessons learned.

## macOS Icon History

- 原文链接: [macOS Icon History](https://basicappleguy.com/basicappleblog/macos-icon-history)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44473400)

Apple has changed the look of macOS icons again in the new version called macOS 26, using a style named Liquid Glass. This new style makes icons look softer, shinier, and more like glass, and the familiar rounded rectangle shape is now even more rounded. Apple also stopped letting icon parts go outside the rectangle, so now all icons fit neatly inside their shapes. The article shows how system icons like System Preferences, Folders, Stickies, Notes, Messages, Calculator, Game Center, Dictionary, App Store, Maps, Podcasts, and Photo Booth have changed over the years. Each icon has gone through many versions, from simple pixel art in early macOS to more detailed and colorful designs later. Icons once had a 3D look, then became flat and simple with macOS Big Sur, and now look glossy and smooth in the new update. The writer has collected these icon changes on social media and will keep updating the collection over the summer, showing the history for each app icon.

In the comments, some people say they love seeing how icons have changed and think it’s fun to remember old designs. A few users miss the old 3D or “aqua” icons from the early 2000s, saying they looked more fun and unique. Others think the new Liquid Glass style is too shiny or feels like a step back to older designs. Some users feel that making all icons fit inside the rounded rectangle makes them look the same and less interesting. A few people like the new look, saying it feels fresh and modern. There are jokes about how often Apple changes icons and how hard it is to keep up. Some designers in the thread talk about how hard it can be to create good icons that work at different sizes. Others point out that icon design shows the bigger changes in how Apple thinks about user interfaces. A few users share memories of their favorite versions of macOS and why they liked those icons best. Some people wonder if Apple will ever let users choose between different icon styles. There are also comments about how icon changes can make old apps look out of place on a new system. Overall, the comments show many different opinions, but most agree that watching icon history is a fun way to see how computers have changed.

## X-Clacks-Overhead

- 原文链接: [X-Clacks-Overhead](https://xclacksoverhead.org/home/about)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44440968)

This article talks about the “X-Clacks-Overhead” HTTP header, which is a small tribute to the writer Terry Pratchett. It explains that the idea comes from Pratchett’s Discworld books, where a network called “The Clacks” sends messages across towers, much like old telegraph systems.

In the Discworld story “Going Postal,” a man named Robert Dearheart keeps his son’s memory alive by sending his name, “GNU John Dearheart,” through the Clacks network forever. The letters G, N, and U mean: send the message onward, don’t log it, and return it at the end, so the name never disappears from the system. The phrase from the book is, “A man is not dead while his name is still spoken.”

Fans of Terry Pratchett wanted to do something similar on the web. They created the X-Clacks-Overhead header, which websites can add to their server responses. This header usually says “GNU Terry Pratchett.” It’s invisible to normal users, but anyone checking the HTTP headers can see it. Big sites like Mozilla.org, Debian, and The Register use this header to honor Pratchett and sometimes others. Anyone can add their own site to a list online if they use the header.

In the comments, many people share their love for this small tribute. Some say it’s a beautiful way to remember someone, and they feel happy when they find a site using the header. Others mention they have added it to their own sites or plan to do so. A few users like the technical side—how something simple and non-intrusive can carry meaning across the web.

Some people explain how to add the header to different web servers, like Apache or Nginx, and share quick code snippets. A few discuss the origin from the Discworld books and talk about other hidden tributes in technology. There are also comments about the meaning of “GNU” and how it fits in the story versus its more common use in software. Some users point out that it’s a quiet, almost secret way to connect with other fans. Others think it’s a small, harmless thing that makes the internet more human. Finally, a few say they now want to read Discworld or learn more about Terry Pratchett.

## The Prime Reasons to Avoid Amazon

- 原文链接: [The Prime Reasons to Avoid Amazon](https://blog.thenewoil.org/the-prime-reasons-to-avoid-amazon)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44475297)

This article talks about why you should not shop at Amazon, even during big sales like Prime Day. The writer thinks Amazon is very harmful for society, and asks people to spend their money somewhere else.

First, the article says Amazon hurts civil rights. The company sold facial recognition tools to police, which often misidentify people, especially minorities. Even after public pressure, Amazon only stopped for a short time and only in the US. Amazon’s Ring doorbells also help police watch people without them knowing.

Second, Amazon hurts small businesses. The article says Amazon uses data from small sellers on its platform to copy their products and sell them cheaper until the small business fails. After that, Amazon raises prices again. This is called unfair competition.

Third, Amazon is bad for workers. Many delivery drivers and warehouse workers say they have to work too fast, sometimes skipping bathroom breaks or working while injured. Amazon uses technology to watch workers closely, and has even tried to stop them from forming unions.

Fourth, Amazon uses its money to control politics. It spends millions on lobbyists to change the law in its favor. The article says Amazon can fight the government in court for a long time, making it almost impossible to regulate them.

The article also says spending money at Amazon is always supporting these problems. Even using Amazon’s other services, like Twitch or Audible, gives money to the company. The writer asks readers to use other options, even if they cost a bit more.

If people must use Amazon, the article gives tips for better privacy, like using strong passwords and gift cards. But the main idea is to avoid Amazon and its other companies as much as possible.

In the Hacker News comments, some people agree that Amazon is too powerful and bad for workers and small businesses. They share stories about poor working conditions and unfair treatment of sellers. Others say it is very hard to avoid Amazon because it is so convenient and often cheaper than other stores. Some commenters point out that other big companies, like Walmart or Google, have similar problems, so avoiding Amazon alone will not fix everything.

A few readers note that for people with low income or in rural areas, Amazon is sometimes the only option for certain products. Some say they try to buy from local stores when they can, but it is not always possible. There are also people who think regulation is the better solution, not personal boycotts. But others believe that if enough people stop shopping at Amazon, it could force the company to change.

Some users recommend alternatives to Amazon, like using local libraries for books and audiobooks, or going to smaller online shops. Others warn that using Amazon gift cards or fake accounts can get you banned and lose your money. A few people discuss the privacy issues with smart home devices like Ring and Alexa, and suggest people look for safer options.

Overall, the comments show a mix of frustration with Amazon, worry about its size and power, and doubt about how much one person can really do. But many agree that it is good to think about where your money goes and try to make better choices when possible.

## The Moat of Low Status

- 原文链接: [The Moat of Low Status](https://usefulfictions.substack.com/p/learn-to-love-the-moat-of-low-status)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44444686)

This article talks about the “Moat of Low Status,” which is the fear of looking bad or silly when you are new at something. The writer says this fear stops people from trying new things or learning new skills because they worry about being embarrassed.

When you start something new, like singing or dancing, you will not be good at first. Others might judge you, and you might feel awkward. The writer calls this the Moat because it is a barrier that keeps beginners out and protects people who are already skilled. Even when learning is faster by doing, like playing poker or learning a language, people often avoid it because of this fear.

The author shares personal stories about being embarrassed in school, college, and while playing poker in public. These times were hard, but they also taught the writer that the world does not end when people laugh or criticize. Instead of waiting for a trick to make the embarrassment go away, the advice is simple: you just have to do the thing anyway, even if you feel bad.

The article suggests some ways to make it easier: notice and be curious about your embarrassment, remember that breaking rules is part of learning, and think about your bigger goals. Also, realize that going through this “Moat” gives you an advantage over people who are too afraid to try. Even though these tips do not make the feeling go away, they help you keep moving.

The author also says that as you get older, life can get boring if you only do safe things. Stepping into new, awkward situations brings excitement and makes life more interesting. Over time, you get used to the feeling of being new and bad at things, and slowly you get better.

In the comments, many readers agree that the fear of low status is very real and strong. Some share their own stories about being afraid to start something new or worrying about what others think. Others say that people often admire those who are brave enough to try, even if they fail at first. A few point out that the fear never fully goes away, but it gets easier with practice. Some think that social media and public sharing make this fear worse because mistakes are more visible. Others say that in certain cultures or workplaces, the fear of embarrassment is even stronger. Some readers wonder if some people are born less sensitive to embarrassment, while others think it can be learned. There are comments about how learning in public can help others too, because it shows that making mistakes is normal. A few people say that being open about failures helped them make friends and learn faster. Some readers add that curiosity and humor help them deal with embarrassment. Others say that the “Moat” is a good thing—it keeps away people who are not serious, so those who cross it have more chances to grow. Overall, most commenters find the article helpful and honest, and many say they will try to be braver about being new at things.
