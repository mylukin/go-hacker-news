Hello everyone, this is the 2025-06-23 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have a mix of stories about space, city life, energy, software, personal journeys, and technology’s impact on our world.

Let’s start with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which just shared its first images. The observatory showed a huge, colorful photo of the Virgo Cluster—a group of galaxies 55 million light-years away. This marks the start of Rubin’s 10-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time. Over the next decade, Rubin will collect massive data to help answer big questions about the universe.

The new image is made from over 1,100 photos and covers about 25 square degrees of sky, which is 100 times the size of the full moon. It shows about 10 million galaxies, but that’s just a small part of the 20 billion galaxies Rubin hopes to capture. The image also includes bright stars from the Milky Way and many far-away galaxies of all shapes and colors. By taking many pictures of the same spot at different times and colors, Rubin can find faint details that other telescopes might miss. Its camera is the largest in the world at 3,200 megapixels and will scan the sky every night.

Rubin helps scientists track moving objects like asteroids and comets, even finding new ones that could threaten Earth. It can quickly notice changes in the sky—like supernovas or stars being eaten by black holes—and send alerts within 60 seconds. With its large view and fast imaging, Rubin is perfect for mapping the Milky Way, tracking changes, and studying dark matter and dark energy—the things that make up most of the universe but can’t be seen directly.

The Rubin team also turned the image into sound, letting people experience the cosmos in a new way.

On Hacker News, many users are excited about the wide view and huge data, saying this can give better statistics and help improve our models of the universe. Others discuss the technical challenges: processing many terabytes of data each night, sending millions of alerts, and making sure small research groups can use the data. Some compare this work to spy satellites, noting that some data is filtered by governments to hide secret objects in orbit. There’s a wish for scientists to get unfiltered data.

Some users talk about the long timeline—many have followed Rubin’s progress for over a decade and are thrilled to see it live. There’s excitement about finding new asteroids, comets, and even objects from outside our solar system, like Oumuamua. While most say the chance of a big asteroid hit is low, they believe the cost of the observatory is worth it if it helps protect us. Others mention the unique patterns in the images, like the colorful spikes from bright stars, which come from Rubin’s design.

A few wonder what happens to big science projects when funding ends, and whether they can keep going. Finally, several users are simply amazed at the beauty and size of space, reminding us how small we are in the universe.

Next up, let’s travel to Kyoto, Japan, where a writer visits a very small coffee shop built in a narrow driveway between houses. These tiny, personal shops are common in Japanese cities and easy to open, thanks to fewer rules. The shop is cozy, switching from coffee in the day to a bar at night. The owner makes each cup with care, jazz music plays from a record player, and the space feels warm and well kept. The writer compares it to stepping into another world, like a peaceful church, and says such places are possible because of Japan’s open rules for small business. This freedom makes Japanese streets lively and interesting.

Commenters praise Japan’s system, comparing it to strict rules in places like Boston or Sydney, where high costs and licenses make it hard for small bars or shops to survive. They note that US cities often force businesses to be bigger, with lots of parking rules, which creates boring, chain-filled neighborhoods. In Japan, even old shops feel welcoming if cared for. There’s talk about nature in cities—some like plants on buildings, others worry about damage. Many share memories of small bars and cafes in Japan, calling them peaceful and special. Some mention similar places in Europe, but say they are harder to find and often more costly. There’s debate about relaxing rules too much, but most agree that Japan’s mix of culture and smart zoning helps keep small businesses friendly. Others worry that Western cities put property value and cars first, which hurts lively, walkable neighborhoods. Overall, people admire Japan’s approach, but see challenges in copying it elsewhere.

Now to Spain and Portugal, where a huge blackout hit the whole Iberian Peninsula on April 28, 2025. The electric grid was under stress for weeks, and on the day of the blackout, strange voltage swings and two big oscillations made the grid unstable. Some power plants shut down to protect themselves from too much voltage, causing a chain reaction. In less than a minute, almost all power generation stopped and the whole region lost power. Teams then worked fast to restore power step by step, using “energy islands” and help from France and Morocco. Most homes got power back within a day.

The report says there was no single cause—many small problems added up. There was not enough fast voltage control, and many renewables could not help control the grid well. Some rules made things harder, and some old power plants did not work as expected. The market gave signals that made some plants reduce power at the wrong time, adding to the trouble. The report found no sign of cyberattacks but suggests making digital systems more secure.

Hacker News users had strong views. Some said the real problem was with market and grid rules, not renewables. Others argued that too much solar and wind can make grids unstable if not controlled well. Some explained that old power plants help keep voltage steady, but renewables and batteries need more tech to do this. Many agreed the blackout was a feedback loop—voltage got too high, plants shut down, voltage rose more, and more plants shut off. Some blamed the market for not giving the right price signals. Others said subsidies for renewables can keep them running even when prices are negative, which can make things worse. Some people worried the report avoided blame, and others said the focus on cybersecurity was too much. Finally, many agreed that the issue is complicated and needs better rules, better tech, and more flexible systems as energy changes.

Moving to software, let’s talk about Solid Queue, a new tool for handling background jobs in Ruby on Rails. Solid Queue stores jobs in your database, so you don’t need tools like Redis. You can schedule jobs for the future, manage recurring jobs, and control how many run at once per user or group. The system stops jobs from running twice, even if there’s a crash. It works well with AppSignal for monitoring and alerts. Solid Queue is simple and reliable, giving Rails users a way to manage jobs without extra servers.

In the comments, one person shared a bad experience with too many queues, making things complex, especially with multi-region support. Others said the problem was not Ruby, but bad design—bad choices can happen in any language. Some noted that Ruby’s Global Interpreter Lock sometimes makes people add queues or overbuild systems too soon. There’s talk about careful use of threads and queues, and about how better type systems help make software safer. Overall, the comments show that team choices matter more than the language, and that simple tools can be best.

Now for a personal story. One man found programming during a very hard time—while in prison. He talked about his troubled past, addiction, mental health struggles, and time spent homeless and in jail. In prison, he started reading about religion, philosophy, math, and finally computers and programming. Even without a computer, he learned about Bitcoin, cryptography, and programming ideas by reading printed Wikipedia pages his brother sent him. After leaving prison, he jumped into coding and now wants to keep learning and sharing his story.

Comments were full of support and respect. Many said his story shows that anyone can change their life. Some talked about how learning and curiosity can help people escape bad situations. A few noted that prison rarely gives chances to learn skills, so his drive is impressive. Some wish more prisons offered programming. Others related, saying they also found coding during tough times. There’s talk about tech being open to people from all backgrounds, and about how learning something new gives hope and purpose.

Switching gears, we have a story about bringing back T9 typing—the old flip phone style—to modern Linux computers, by making a new driver. T9 let you type by pressing each number key once per letter, and the phone guessed the word. The Linux driver makes it possible to type with just a number pad, good for small devices or when you don’t want a big keyboard. The project is open source and can learn new words, handle different languages, and guess what you want to type.

Many commenters dislike current TV remote typing, finding on-screen keyboards slow. Some wish T9 was on TV remotes, saying it would be much faster. Others remember the good feeling of blind-typing on old phones. There are jokes about kids not knowing T9. Some talk about building T9 keyboards for watches or small devices. There’s also talk about how T9 was fast for short texts, but longer messages were easier on slide-out keyboards. Many miss the speed and simplicity of T9 for quick typing.

Next is Fairphone 6, a new smartphone focused on being more sustainable and easier to repair. The design now uses screws so users can open the phone and swap the battery or other parts, making it last longer. Fairphone aims to reduce waste, use fair materials, and support workers. But it has removed features like the headphone jack, which some people do not like. The phone is more expensive than others, but the company says this supports fair labor and longer life. It may not have the highest specs, and is not available everywhere, especially in the US.

Commenters have strong opinions. Many love the idea of a phone you can fix and keep for years. Some miss removable batteries and headphone jacks, while others say wireless headphones are fine. Some wish the phone was smaller. Supporters say it is worth paying more for a fair, long-lasting phone, while critics say the specs are too low. There are complaints about US support, and debate about how long software updates will last. Some want better security or Linux support, but know this is hard for a small company. Many still wish for the old rear fingerprint sensor. There’s a debate about ethical buying versus practicality, but most agree that more repairable and sustainable phones are needed.

Let’s talk about terminal workflows. One author shared how they use tmux, nvim, and custom scripts to speed up development. Their setup starts with Windows Terminal, connects by SSH with tmux, and uses zsh, zoxide, and ripgrep for fast searching and navigation. Files can be opened directly in nvim, with buffers managed for easy switching. The author built scripts for file opening and pane management, using Perl and shell. They chose tmux for its flexibility, but may move to Kitty for better SSH and less complexity. The setup is complex, but the speed and control are worth it.

In the comments, many users relate to the desire for custom workflows but warn about the cost of maintaining them. Some say mastering basic tools is more important than fancy setups, while others enjoy customizing for personal efficiency. There’s debate about whether better tooling really makes a better programmer, but most agree that investing in your tools can give a real boost. There are also tips about minimal configs for portability, and stories about using simple editors like nano for quick tasks. Some compare the flexibility of tmux and Emacs, while others wish terminals had more structure or better integration with modern AI tools. Overall, there’s a shared love for powerful, scriptable developer tools, mixed with caution about over-customizing.

Now for a technical porting story. Someone moved the pigz compression tool from Unix to Windows. Pigz uses pthreads for threading, which Windows doesn’t have, but a Windows version exists. The author used that, plus Windows versions of other Unix parts like dirent.h. Some C functions have different names in Windows, which were fixed with defines. The author put these changes in a file called wincompat.h. Pigz uses GCC and make on Unix, but on Windows, the author used Premake to generate Visual Studio project files. This made the build process much easier.

In the comments, people discuss porting code using pthreads, and how sometimes only a small part is needed. There’s talk about memory functions in Windows, and how pigz can use all CPU cores, which is satisfying on big servers. Some like Premake, others suggest Xmake or Meson. There’s discussion about using pigz for server backups and how Unix parallelism helps with big jobs. Someone links to the pigz repository for those interested.

Finally, FICO will start using buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) loans to help decide people’s credit scores. Before, BNPL was not counted, so scores did not show all debt or payment habits. FICO is now making two new credit scores that look at BNPL data. This should make scores more accurate and fair. A study with Affirm showed that most people with five or more BNPL loans would see their scores go up or not change. Still, some are worried—more people are paying BNPL late each year, which could hurt scores. Some see this as a fair update, while others fear it could hurt borrowers who are struggling.

Hacker News users had mixed views. Some say it makes sense, since BNPL was not counted before and now the true picture will show. Others worry that credit scores could go down if people use BNPL too much or pay late. Some think this will help lenders see risks better, but others worry many people do not understand that BNPL can affect their scores. The comments show both hope and concern for this change.
