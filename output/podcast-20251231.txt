Hello everyone, this is the 2025-12-31 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have stories about programming books, new chips, digital privacy, rare games, compilers, spacecraft design, microtonal music, startup life, and video pixels. Let’s get started.

First, we have the story of a computer science professor who cancelled his book deal with a big publisher. He wanted to write a book about classic programming projects, but working with a publisher turned out to be more frustrating than helpful. At first, the publisher offered editing and help with logistics, but the pay was low and the deadlines were strict. He was pushed to use their writing tools and follow their style. The publisher wanted him to add a Python basics chapter and later even asked for AI content, which did not fit his vision. Editing feedback often missed the point, and the process made him lose interest. After missing a few deadlines, the publisher ended the contract and returned all rights to him. Now, he plans to self-publish the book, releasing chapters as he finishes them.

In the comments, many people supported his choice, saying publishers pay little and want too much control. Some shared their own bad experiences, and others noted that self-publishing is easier today with tools like Gumroad and Amazon, especially if you already have an audience. Some warned that self-publishing is hard work, especially for editing and distribution. Readers liked the idea of selling chapters one by one, but a few worried that readers might lose interest if the book is not finished fast. Most said they would buy the book when it comes out.

Next, we talk about a new computer chip that works with light, not electricity. This “all-optical synthesis chip” is made for large-scale vision tasks. Because it uses light, the chip can process data faster and with less energy. It can handle images and language at the same time, which could help in things like self-driving cars or smart cameras. The chip is small, does not get hot, and uses special materials to control light inside. The researchers showed it can work with real data in the lab, and hope it will be used in phones, cars, and robots in the future.

In the comments, some people are excited about the future of light-based chips. Others think it will take time before these chips are common, and some wonder if they will work with today’s AI software. There are questions about cost, large-scale production, and if this chip is just for special tasks or will change all computing. Many are hopeful, but say we need to see how fast this technology will spread.

Our third story is about digital privacy, or more exactly, digital control. The author says control—over your data and devices—is more important than just privacy. Many popular tools, like Gmail and WhatsApp, make things easy but take away control. The author shares their setup: they use the GNU pass password manager only on their laptop, Signal for messaging, GrapheneOS on their phone, and open-source apps from F-Droid. Email is run on their own domain with Tuta, and web browsing happens on Firefox with privacy add-ons. Calendar and contacts are hosted at home on a Raspberry Pi, and Cloudflare is used for domain and DNS.

Commenters agree that control is a better word than privacy. Some like open-source tools, but note they can be hard for less technical people. Others discuss trade-offs between convenience and control, and debate if Cloudflare can be trusted. Hosting your own services is praised but seen as too much work for most people. Many agree you can never get perfect control, but doing something is better than nothing. People shared extra tips, like using multiple browsers or virtual machines. Most readers liked the honest look at what is possible and what is hard.

Now, let’s talk about saving a lost video game prototype. Fans from Hidden Palace worked hard to recover data from a broken DVD holding a rare “Beta 4” version of Shadow the Hedgehog. They used about 200 different DVD drives, tried many tools, and learned how DVDs store data. Most drives hide useful error correction data, but some gave them more raw information. They built a new tool called DiscImageMender, which uses many partial dumps and error codes to rebuild damaged discs. In the end, they fixed almost all sectors, and found another disc that matched their fixed image, proving their method worked.

In the comments, people praised the technical depth and hard work. Some shared stories of trying to read old discs, while others talked about the value of these efforts for game history. There was respect for the passion and patience needed for this kind of preservation, and some fun jokes about the “edgy” style of Shadow the Hedgehog.

Next, we have an article reminding us that compilers are not our enemy. In fact, they are our best friend if we work with them. The article explains how compilers in languages like Rust, Java, and TypeScript help catch bugs early. Many developers make things harder by “lying” to the compiler—using types that do not match reality, or hiding side effects. The advice is to use types that reflect real logic, like Option or Result for missing values or errors, and to separate pure and side-effect functions. Using precise types and enums helps the compiler check more for you, and makes illegal states impossible.

In the comments, readers agree that strong types help catch bugs and make code safer. Some say strict compilers can feel slow, especially in small projects, or that too many types can make code harder to read. Others note that not all teams allow changes to type systems, and that tests are still needed. Many agree that helping the compiler also helps your teammates and your future self, but remind us not to overdo it—code should be clear for people too.

Now we move to Akin’s Laws of Spacecraft Design, a list of rules for engineering that are useful for any big project. The first law says engineering needs numbers, not just opinions. You should design for failure, expect change, and accept that your best ideas may not make it to the final product. The laws warn against finding fake patterns, trusting analysis without checking, and falling in love with your tools. Simplicity, documentation, and clear responsibility are key. You should not wait for perfect information or build more than needed. Learn from mistakes, document problems, and always check your work.

Many commenters found the laws funny and painfully true. Some wish they learned these lessons earlier. People discussed how the laws fit all types of engineering, not just space. There were stories about documentation, schedules slipping, and the balance between experience and new ideas. Most agreed that these rules are honest and useful.

Up next, we have Spiral Synth, a web piano for microtonal music. The tool lets you play with more than the usual 12 notes per octave, supporting 19, 24, 31, and 53-note scales. You can use your computer keyboard to play notes, change sound settings, and see chords in special layouts. The goal is to make it easy to learn and explore music from many cultures, not just Western music.

In the comments, people are excited to try different tunings and say the tool makes microtonal music more accessible. Some wish they had this tool when learning music theory, while others like the sound design options and visual chord displays. There are requests for more features, like custom tunings and MIDI support. People also ask about the math behind the tool. Overall, readers think it’s a fun and smart way to explore new music.

Now let’s talk about startup life. The founder-CTO of RevenueCat shared what year eight at the company was like. He almost sold the company for a big amount, but chose to keep building instead. He explains that selling would mean losing control and changing the company’s special culture. To make staying easier, they raised more money so they could feel safe. The founder focused on building an app, networking, hiring carefully, and building a strong culture. Mistakes included spending too much time on hiring and moving people between projects too quickly. He also started a new team to try new projects fast. Personally, he found exercise and family support helped with stress.

Comments praise the honesty and detail. Some think not selling was brave, while others worry it was risky. People like the focus on culture, and discuss the challenges of hiring and keeping good people. There is interest in technical changes and in the idea of “vibe coding.” Many agree that startup life is both hard and rewarding.

Finally, we have a story about video pixels. The author explains that not all videos use square pixels, which can cause problems when showing videos on web pages. There are three key numbers: storage aspect ratio, pixel aspect ratio, and display aspect ratio. If you only use width and height, you might display videos wrongly. The article shows how to use ffprobe and ffmpeg to check these values, and shares Python code to calculate the right ratio. The author says non-square pixels are rare today but still show up in some YouTube Shorts and old TV formats.

In the comments, people remember non-square pixels from old TVs and cameras. Some say video tools still do not handle this well, and others share stories about funny effects in old games. There are debates about whether browsers should hide these details or if developers need to learn them. Some thank the author for the clear math and code, while others say this is a rare problem today, but still good to know about.

That’s all for today. Thanks for listening to Hacker News Daily Podcast. We hope you enjoyed these stories and learned something new. See you next time!
