## It's time for modern CSS to kill the SPA

- 原文链接: [It's time for modern CSS to kill the SPA](https://www.jonoalderson.com/conjecture/its-time-for-modern-css-to-kill-the-spa/)

This article says that modern CSS and browser features now make it possible to have smooth, fast page transitions without using Single Page Applications (SPAs). The author argues that most sites use SPAs only to copy the “app-like” feel, but this is no longer needed.

SPAs became popular because they could show smooth transitions and not reload the whole page when you click a link. But this caused problems: slow loading times, broken scroll or focus, loading spinners, and lots of heavy JavaScript. The author says most SPAs don’t really feel smooth—they just try to “fake” what browsers could already do.

Now, browsers like Chrome and Edge support the View Transitions API. With just a little CSS, you can fade between pages or animate shared elements (like a product image) without any JavaScript. You can do things like keep headers or navbars in place, and it all works with normal URLs and pages.

If you need even faster navigation, Speculation Rules let the browser preload or prerender pages before a user clicks. This can make navigation almost instant, but only if your site is already fast and light.

Browsers also help with things like the Back/Forward Cache, which makes going back and forth between pages very quick—unless JavaScript gets in the way, which often happens with SPAs.

The author compares an average Next.js SPA (big JavaScript bundles, slow time-to-interactive, tricky SEO) with a modern multi-page site using these new browser features (small or no JavaScript, fast loading, simple SEO, perfect scroll and focus).

Most websites, like blogs and shops, do not need to be built as SPAs. The article says that using frameworks and heavy JavaScript for every project is a mistake. Instead, use HTML, CSS, and the browser’s features unless you truly need complex interactivity.

From the comments, some developers agree and say they are tired of heavy SPAs for simple sites. Others point out that not all browsers support these new CSS and API features yet, so it’s not always easy to use them in real projects. A few remind us that SPAs are still good for very complex web apps, like Gmail or Figma, where everything happens on one page. Some people say that clients and managers still ask for “app-like” sites because it sounds modern, even if it’s not needed.

There are also comments about how tools and frameworks keep pushing SPAs because it’s their business, not because it’s best for every website. Some worry that jumping into new browser features could cause problems for users on older browsers. Others are excited to try the View Transitions API and wish browsers had done this sooner. A few commenters discuss how hard it is to change habits or convince teams to use simpler solutions.

Overall, the main feeling is that many developers want faster, simpler sites, but there are challenges—like browser support, old habits, and business pressure—that make it hard to move away from SPAs right now.

## A Union Pacific-Norfolk Southern combination would redraw the railroad map

- 原文链接: [A Union Pacific-Norfolk Southern combination would redraw the railroad map](https://www.trains.com/trn/news-reviews/news-wire/a-union-pacific-norfolk-southern-combination-would-redraw-the-railroad-map/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44688265)

Union Pacific wants to buy Norfolk Southern, two big train companies in the United States. If they join together, it would change how trains move goods across the country.

The article explains that both companies have thousands of miles of track. Union Pacific mainly works in the West, and Norfolk Southern in the East. If they join, one company would control a huge part of the country’s railways. This would make it easier to send goods coast-to-coast without switching trains. It could also help them compete with trucks and the Canadian rail companies, who already have coast-to-coast routes. The article says this deal might save money by cutting extra jobs or closing some offices. But it could also mean less competition, which might raise prices for companies that use trains to ship things. The government will need to decide if this deal is fair. In the past, the government has stopped big train company deals because they worried about less competition and higher prices. The article also says that if this deal happens, other train companies might try to join up too.

People in the comments have different ideas. Some say the deal is good because trains need to be stronger to fight truck companies and Canadian railroads. Others worry that one company will be too powerful, and customers will pay more. Some commentors talk about how past train company deals promised better service, but it did not always happen. A few say that fewer train companies can make shipping slower or less reliable. Others point out that the government might not allow the deal anyway. Some people think the train system should be more like Europe, where tracks and trains are run by different groups. A few say that big changes could even help the environment if more goods move by train instead of truck. There are also worries about job losses if the companies combine. Some people hope the deal will push for better service, but others are not sure. Overall, people are split—some see big benefits, while others see big risks.

## Vanilla JavaScript support for Tailwind Plus

- 原文链接: [Vanilla JavaScript support for Tailwind Plus](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/vanilla-js-support-for-tailwind-plus)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44686317)

Tailwind Plus now lets you use its UI blocks with plain JavaScript, so you don’t need React or Vue to get dropdowns, dialogs, and more working. This makes it much easier for anyone to add interactive parts to their website with just HTML and CSS.

The big change comes from a new library called `@tailwindplus/elements`. This library gives you special HTML tags like `<el-dropdown>`, `<el-select>`, and others. These tags handle all the hard work, like keyboard support, focus, and ARIA accessibility, so you don’t have to write your own JavaScript for things like dropdown menus or command palettes.

For example, you can make a dropdown by just writing the right HTML tags, and it will work right away. There’s also a way to make select menus, dialogs, and even command palettes with only HTML, using these special tags. The library covers many UI parts: autocomplete, popovers, tabs, and more. All the pieces use modern web features like custom elements, the `popover` attribute, and native dialogs. If your browser doesn’t support something, Tailwind Plus includes polyfills so things still work.

The best part is that these elements work everywhere: in plain HTML pages, with Svelte, Rails, React, or any other framework. You don’t need to use a special React or Vue library if you don’t want to. You can even use these elements inside your forms, and they will send data just like normal form controls.

Now, looking at the top comments on Hacker News, people are excited about this update. Many like that you don’t need to learn a whole framework to get interactive elements. Some say this is a big win for accessibility, since the custom elements handle ARIA and keyboard support. Others point out that using native browser features is smart, because it should mean faster and smaller websites in the future.

There are also a few concerns. Some users worry about browser support for these new HTML features, even with polyfills. Others are not sure about locking these features behind a paid Tailwind Plus plan. Some say that using custom elements can make it harder to debug or style things in very unique ways. A few people mention that it’s cool these elements can be used with any framework, but they wonder if there will be edge cases or tricky bugs when mixing them with big apps.

Overall, most people think this is a great move for web development. It makes building complex, interactive UIs easier for everyone, not just for developers who use React or Vue. Many are happy to see web standards being used in real products and hope other companies will do the same.

## It's a DE9, not a DB9 (but we know what you mean)

- 原文链接: [It's a DE9, not a DB9 (but we know what you mean)](https://news.sparkfun.com/14298)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44682964)

This article talks about the real name of the common 9-pin serial connector you see on old computers. Many people call it a "DB9," but the correct name is "DE9."

The connector is part of the D-subminiature, or D-sub, family. The "D" means the connector is D-shaped, and the next letter shows the shell size. For example, "DB" is for the big 25-pin connector (DB25), and "DE" is for the smaller 9-pin version (DE9). The number after the letters tells how many pins are inside. So, the 9-pin serial connector should be called DE9, not DB9, because "B" is for the larger 25-pin shell, not the small 9-pin one. Still, people started saying "DB9" because they already knew the term "DB25" from old computers, and just changed the number for the smaller connector. Even though it's not correct, "DB9" became the name everyone uses.

SparkFun, the company behind the article, decided to use the proper "DE9" name for their new product. They want to help teach people the right term and be clear and accurate. Even though most people search for "DB9," they chose to stick with the correct label to help clear up confusion and support learning in the community.

In the Hacker News comments, some people say they never knew about the DE9 name and always called it DB9, just like everyone else. A few commenters remember learning the correct name in school or from official documents. Some think it's not a big problem because everyone understands "DB9" anyway, and technical language often changes to match what most people say. Others argue it's good to be correct, especially when teaching or making products. A few joke about other tech names that people get wrong, showing this mix-up is common in tech. Some users appreciate the detailed explanation and say they learned something new. Others wonder if using the right name will actually catch on, since habits are hard to change. A couple of people point out that using the right words helps avoid mistakes in big projects. Overall, people agree it's interesting to learn the history behind the name, even if most will probably keep saying "DB9" out of habit.

## Experimental surgery performed by AI-driven surgical robot

- 原文链接: [Experimental surgery performed by AI-driven surgical robot](https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/experimental-surgery-performed-by-ai-driven-surgical-robot/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44688096)

A team at Johns Hopkins used AI to control a surgical robot and perform an experimental gallbladder surgery on pig organs. This is the first time a DaVinci surgical robot, usually guided by a human, has done surgery using a ChatGPT-like AI system.

Before, robots like STAR could do simple tasks with a lot of help and planning from humans. This new robot, called SRT-H, can learn from watching humans and from feedback, so it is much more flexible. The AI uses transformer models, the same technology behind ChatGPT, to plan and carry out each step of the surgery. Researchers trained the robot by having a human perform the surgery many times on pig organs. They collected videos, movement data, and instructions, so the robot could learn each step.

The main surgery chosen was gallbladder removal, which is common in hospitals. The robot learned to do all 17 steps, including clipping and cutting important tubes, without letting fluids leak out. After training, SRT-H could do the surgery on new pig organs with 100% success. It could also understand simple spoken feedback, like “move left” or “clip higher,” and improve over time. The robot was as accurate as an expert human surgeon, but a bit slower. It also worked well on organs that looked different or had small problems.

However, there are still limits. To train for real human surgeries, the AI needs lots of special movement data. The company that makes DaVinci robots does not want to share this data, worrying about business secrets. The researchers are looking for ways around this, like adding sensors to regular tools for new data. They also dream about future robots that could work in many areas of medicine.

In the comments, some people are excited and see this as a big step for surgery and AI. They say robots might one day help patients in places with few doctors. Others worry about safety, mistakes, and who is responsible if something goes wrong. Some say human surgeons have skills and judgment that are hard for AI to match, especially in rare or unexpected cases. A few think the slow speed of the robot could be a problem in emergencies. There is also talk about companies blocking data and slowing down research for business reasons. Some believe open data could make these robots better and safer, while others warn that moving too fast with AI in medicine could be risky. Many agree this is an important start, but human oversight will still be needed for a long time.

## Why MIT switched from Scheme to Python (2009)

- 原文链接: [Why MIT switched from Scheme to Python (2009)](https://www.wisdomandwonder.com/link/2110/why-mit-switched-from-scheme-to-python)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44685119)

MIT changed its main beginner programming course from Scheme to Python because programming and engineering had changed since the 1980s. Back then, programmers wrote code close to the hardware and used simple, small parts that they fully understood, like how a resistor works in electronics. The course used Scheme to teach students how to build bigger systems from these small parts. But by the 2000s, Sussman (a professor) said software was now much more complex—people must deal with big, sometimes confusing libraries and try things out to see how they work. So, MIT’s new course used robots, which are more unpredictable than simple parts, and Python, which already had good libraries for working with robots.

Sussman explained that Python was chosen mainly because it had the tools needed for the new class goals, not because it was better for teaching ideas. The move was also practical: Python is popular and used for many real-world projects, and it lets students start building things quickly. Still, he pointed out that programming today means working with code you do not fully control or understand, unlike before.

In the comments, many people shared strong feelings. Some were sad or angry, saying MIT was giving up on teaching deep computer science by picking a more “practical” language. They felt Scheme taught students to think in a special way and helped them become better programmers. Others agreed with the change, saying Python is more useful for beginners, easier to learn, and helps students make real things faster. Some worried Python hides important ideas behind its syntax or is confusing in its own way. A few said the language does not matter as much as teaching the right concepts. People also discussed if it’s better to teach programming that matches real jobs or to focus on theory and hard problems. Some missed the old days of learning “all the way down,” while others thought change was normal as technology moves forward. There was also talk about how students who want deeper knowledge can still find advanced courses in Scheme or other hard topics. Overall, the switch showed a split between those who value theory and those who want practical skills first.

## Animated Cursors

- 原文链接: [Animated Cursors](https://tattoy.sh/news/animated-cursors/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44686164)

This article talks about Tattoy, a terminal tool, now supporting animated cursors. The writer explains how Tattoy uses the same cursor format as another tool called Ghostty, but the way it draws the cursor is different.

Ghostty draws the cursor using actual pixels, so the animation is smooth and detailed. Tattoy, on the other hand, is text-based and uses special block characters, like "▀" and "▄", to make a pixel-like effect. Because of this, Tattoy’s cursors can look more pixelated and may miss some small details that Ghostty’s cursors show. Still, some users might like this pixel style.

Adding support for Ghostty shaders in Tattoy was quick, but making everything work perfectly took about a week. A big problem was how to handle transparent and smooth edges (antialiasing) in the animated cursors. Ghostty can check the color of each pixel, but Tattoy cannot, because it only works with text characters. To solve this, Tattoy makes a kind of low-quality image of the terminal using the color of the text. It then sends this image to the computer’s graphics card (GPU) to help with the effects. This fixed some problems, but it also caused new ones, because the background image got mixed up with the cursor image. The writer fixed this by comparing the original and final images and only showing the parts that are different.

The result works well, but there can be some lag, especially when the terminal window is large. More improvements are planned to make it faster. One possible fix is to let Tattoy control all cursor drawing, instead of sharing with the terminal program. Now, both Tattoy and the terminal draw the cursor, which may cause some delay.

In the comment section, many users are excited by the idea of animated cursors in a text terminal. Some say it brings a fun, modern look to old-style terminals. Others wonder if the pixelated look is better or worse than smooth cursors. A few people worry about lag and want to know how much it affects real use. Some are impressed by the clever tricks used to blend the images and handle transparency. There are also comments from users who like the idea that tools like Tattoy can be changed and improved so easily. A couple of people point out that not everyone will want fancy animated cursors, especially if they prefer speed and simplicity. Some developers share ideas about how to make the animations faster. Others ask if this kind of cursor could be used in other terminal apps. Overall, the comments show a mix of excitement, technical questions, and suggestions for the future.

## Efficient Computer's Electron E1 CPU – 100x more efficient than Arm?

- 原文链接: [Efficient Computer's Electron E1 CPU – 100x more efficient than Arm?](https://morethanmoore.substack.com/p/efficient-computers-electron-e1-cpu)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44685050)

Efficient Computer has announced a new CPU called the Electron E1, which they say is up to 100 times more energy-efficient than the best ARM chips for embedded systems. This chip uses a new idea called a “spatial data flow” architecture, which is very different from normal CPUs that move data around a lot and use caches.

The Electron E1 has no cache and does not use out-of-order execution. Instead, it is made of a grid of small “tiles.” Each tile does a simple job, like math or memory, and data moves between these tiles. There is no central program counter or schedule; instead, the compiler decides everything before the program runs. The compiler turns C++ or Rust code into a data flow graph and sets up how data will move across the tiles. If the program is too big for the chip, the compiler breaks it into smaller pieces and loads them as needed.

This way, the chip saves a lot of energy by not sending data back and forth all the time. Efficient Computer also says their chip can run code written in usual languages like C++ and Rust, and can work with machine learning tools like TensorFlow and PyTorch. Their new compiler, called effcc, is now downloadable so developers can try the chip with real code. The chip also supports 32-bit floating point numbers, which is not common for low-power chips.

But, there are some big challenges. The compiler has to be very smart, because it must solve problems that normal CPUs fix while running. If something goes wrong, it’s not clear how easy it will be for developers to find and fix those problems. Also, the main way Efficient Computer measures performance is “operations per joule” or “TOPS per watt,” which are usually used for AI chips, not general CPUs. Real-world tests and benchmarks are still needed to see if the chip’s efficiency is as good as they claim. Developers also care about things like latency, memory use, and how easy it is to replace old chips with new ones.

In the Hacker News comments, some people are excited about this new approach and say it is good to see someone try something very different in CPU design. Others are more careful, saying that “magic compilers” have often failed before, and that normal compilers already struggle with tricky code. Some developers worry that if the compiler or toolchain is not easy to use, or if it does not give clear errors, adoption will be slow. There are questions about how well it will really handle large, complex programs, and what will happen in edge cases.

Some commenters point out that the embedded market likes parts that are stable and available for many years, so a new chip has to prove it can last. Others note that comparing “TOPS per watt” is not always fair, and want to see standard benchmarks like SPEC2006 before believing the claims. A few people wonder if the chip can run popular programs like Doom, which is a common test for new CPUs. There is also talk about whether the chip’s model can scale up to bigger systems, or if it will get stuck with the same problems as other new architectures. Overall, the community is interested but wants to see real results before getting too excited.

## Never write your own date parsing library

- 原文链接: [Never write your own date parsing library](https://www.zachleat.com/web/adventures-in-date-parsing/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44685875)

This article is about why you should not write your own date parsing library and tells the story of Eleventy’s changes in date parsing. The author explains that date parsing is hard, with many hidden problems, and most people are better off using a trusted library instead of building their own.

In 2018, Eleventy used the Luxon library for parsing dates, which worked well for Node.js. But as Eleventy started to run in more places, Luxon became a problem because it was large and did not support tree-shaking, making final bundles much bigger than needed. The author looked at other libraries like Moment, Dayjs, and date-fns. Dayjs was small but failed many tests, and others were also too big or complex. The real issue is that date parsing has many confusing rules, especially with formats like ISO 8601, where even simple strings can mean strange things. For example, "200" is a decade, not a year.

The article says that strict date formats are better, and Eleventy is moving to use the new RFC 9557 format, which matches what the new JavaScript Temporal API uses. The author decided to write a very small, focused library called @11ty/parse-date-strings for this. This new library only parses dates (no formatting) and matches the new standards. It is much smaller than Luxon and will make Eleventy simpler and faster. The author also lists other date libraries and Temporal polyfills you can try.

In the comments, many people agree that date parsing is very hard and full of surprises. Some say they have also tried to write their own parser and always found bugs or strange edge cases. Others point out that even popular libraries can fail for some formats or time zones. Some think using strict date formats like RFC 9557 is a good idea and wish more projects would do this. A few people share stories about problems with JavaScript’s built-in Date.parse, which behaves differently in different browsers. Some warn that even with new libraries, testing is important because date handling is tricky. There are also comments about the size of dependencies and how it matters for performance, especially in the browser. A few people think that sometimes, writing your own small library is okay if your needs are very simple, but most agree you should use trusted libraries if possible. Some are excited that the new Temporal API will help, but others wish it had arrived sooner. Overall, the discussion shows that date parsing is harder than it looks, and almost everyone has been tripped up by it at some point.

## CO2 Battery

- 原文链接: [CO2 Battery](https://energydome.com/co2-battery/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44685067)

This article is about a new kind of battery called the “CO2 Battery” made by Energy Dome for long-duration energy storage. The CO2 Battery uses carbon dioxide (CO2) to store and release energy, instead of lithium like most batteries today.

The main idea is to use CO2 in a closed system. When you want to store energy, electricity is used to compress CO2 into a liquid and store it at normal temperatures. When you need electricity again, the CO2 is allowed to expand and turn back into a gas, which spins a turbine to generate power. This process does not release any CO2 into the air. The battery is efficient, with over 75% of the energy returned after storage, and does not lose capacity over time. It can work for more than 30 years and uses parts that are easy to find anywhere in the world. It is also cheaper to build and run than lithium batteries, and does not need rare metals. The system is already working at a large scale and connected to the power grid. It works best for storing energy for 8 to 24 hours, which is perfect for solar and wind energy.

The CO2 Battery is different from compressed air storage because it does not need very cold temperatures, which saves money. All the materials—mostly water, steel, and CO2—are easy to get, and the same design can be used anywhere. The company says their battery is a better choice than lithium-ion batteries because it lasts longer, costs less, and is more eco-friendly.

People in the Hacker News comments had mixed opinions. Some said this is a smart idea because CO2 is not rare or expensive, and the system is safe for the environment. They liked that there is no need for lithium, which is hard to mine and may cause pollution. Others were unsure if this battery will really be as cheap as the company claims, or if the efficiency is good enough compared to other options. Some users pointed out that while the technology sounds promising, the real test will be how well it works at very large scales and over many years. A few people worried about possible leaks of CO2, but others answered that the system is closed and should be safe. Some asked about the maintenance and if the moving parts will wear out quickly. There was interest in how this technology could help countries without access to lithium or advanced materials. Others suggested waiting to see more real-world results before getting too excited. Overall, many agreed it is good to see new ideas for storing green energy, even if there are still questions to answer.
