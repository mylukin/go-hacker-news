"Notation as a Tool of Thought" is an article by Kenneth E. Iverson that discusses how the way we write things down can affect how we think and solve problems. Iverson explains that notation isn't just about writing; it's a tool that can shape our thinking and creativity.

He starts by talking about how different types of notation can make complex ideas easier to understand. For example, math has its own symbols which help us think about numbers and equations more clearly. Iverson believes that the right kind of notation can make problem-solving more efficient and can even lead to new discoveries.

Iverson also mentions how computer programming languages are a form of notation. He argues that simpler, clear languages can make coding more intuitive and help programmers think better. He uses examples from APL, a programming language he created, to show how concise notation can reduce errors and boost productivity.

In the Hacker News comments, many users agree with Iverson's views on notation. Some say that finding the right notation is like finding the right tool for a job—it can make tasks easier and quicker. Others mention how programming languages like Python are popular because their syntax is so readable and approachable.

Some users point out that while notation is important, it's also vital to understand the underlying concepts. They argue that good notation can help, but it can't replace a solid understanding of the subject. A few comments discuss how different fields, like music or art, also use unique notations to communicate complex ideas.

Overall, the discussion highlights how notation can be a powerful part of thinking and problem-solving, but it's just one piece of the puzzle.

So, there's this interesting problem with Substack's editor. If you try writing paths like `/etc/hosts` in a draft, it fails to save and gives a "Network Error." The issue isn't with Substack's servers; everything else works. But when these specific paths are included, the editor stops working. It seems like system paths such as `/etc/hosts` are being blocked.

The author found out that a Web Application Firewall (WAF) might be causing this. WAFs protect websites by blocking suspicious traffic, like path traversal attacks. These attacks can let hackers access sensitive files on a server. So, Substack's system might be mistaking normal text for hacking attempts, blocking the content to be extra safe. But this also causes trouble for technical writers who need to discuss these paths.

In the comments, folks had a lot to say. Some users pointed out that WAFs are often misconfigured and can block legitimate content. They think it's a balance between security and usability, but sometimes the rules are too strict. Others argued that economic and insurance pressures force companies to use such security measures, even if they're not perfect. Some users felt that WAFs can be a quick fix for security audits but often lead to more problems than solutions. The general sentiment is that while WAFs have their place, they need to be smarter about not blocking legitimate technical content.

- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43790420)

The article explores what it would be like to redesign Apache Kafka, a popular event streaming platform, from scratch, especially for cloud environments. It discusses the idea of moving towards a more cloud-native setup, integrating with object storage like Amazon S3 to improve elasticity and reduce costs. The author shares a wishlist of features for a new version of Kafka, including key-centric access instead of partitions, better concurrency control, built-in schema support, and easier extensibility.

The article argues for doing away with partitions, which are essential in the current Kafka for scaling data on local disks, but less needed with cloud storage. Instead, focusing on key-level access could improve efficiency and ordering of messages. It also suggests introducing topic hierarchies, similar to Solace, to make subscribing to data more flexible. Other ideas include better concurrency controls to prevent outdated data from being written, and broker-side schema support to simplify data handling.

In the Hacker News comments, opinions vary. Some users agree with the need to solve issues like head-of-line blocking, which occurs when a slow message delays others. There’s a discussion about the complexity of processing messages in order, with some suggesting that systems like Pulsar also struggle with it. Others mention alternatives like NATS and Redis Streams as simpler solutions for some use cases.

Some commenters defend Kafka, noting it works well when managed properly, while others criticize its complexity and the difficulties in managing clusters. There’s also mention of Kafka alternatives like Redpanda and Pulsar, which offer different features and might be easier to manage. A few users discuss the architectural challenges of using Kafka and propose using different technologies for specific needs, like scaling or concurrency.

## A Visual Journey Through Async Rust

- 原文链接: [A Visual Journey Through Async Rust](https://github.com/alexpusch/rust-magic-patterns/blob/master/visual-journey-through-async-rust/Readme.md)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43789142)

The article is about understanding async programming in Rust, using visual tools to show how async execution works. It focuses on how tasks and threads interact and the difference between concurrency and parallelism.

The author uses a Rust project to visualize async Rust by plotting sine waves. The sine waves are calculated by async tasks that yield execution periodically, allowing other tasks to run. The project uses Tokio, an async runtime, to manage these tasks. By plotting the results, the author shows how async tasks run concurrently but not in parallel. This means tasks take turns running, rather than running at the same time. The author also explores how CPU-intensive tasks can block the event loop, slowing down other tasks. To fix this, they suggest breaking tasks into smaller parts or offloading them to a different thread. They also experiment with spawning tasks on separate threads, which helps improve performance by using multiple CPU cores. Finally, they use `spawn_blocking`, a Tokio feature that runs blocking code on a separate thread pool, to manage heavy computations better.

In the comments, people generally like the visualizations and find them a good way to learn async Rust. Some point out that CPU-intensive tasks naturally need CPU time, and async systems need to handle blocking I/O carefully to avoid wasting CPU resources. Others discuss the pros and cons of async programming in different languages, like Python and Java. One comment notes how async I/O needs to be fully async to gain benefits. Another user mentions that the sine wave calculations could be affected by timing inaccuracies, like the variable runtime of calculations or the way Rust's `Instant` measures time. There's also a bit of discussion about how similar async concepts could be applied in other programming environments.

- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43793288)

The article is about a new idea for Eurorack synthesizer knobs, which combines the knob and patch cable into one unit using a magnetic encoder chip. The writer discusses the challenges of compact Eurorack setups and proposes using a 3.5mm jack with a magnetic encoder to create a knob that can also act as a patch cable. The encoder used is an AS5600, which is not cheap but easy to work with. The project involves modifying a TRS plug to house a small magnet that interacts with the encoder chip. The circuit design involves setting up a board for the AS5600 sensor, and the assembly process is detailed with some challenges noted regarding space and clearance. While the prototype works, the writer doubts its commercial viability due to cost and compatibility issues with existing modules.

In the comments, users share various perspectives. Some appreciate the innovative approach but highlight that existing designs already offer similar functionality with knobs and attenuators. There’s discussion about the balance between compactness and usability, with some users preferring setups with more space and physical controls. Others reflect on the broader culture of Eurorack enthusiasts, noting that many enjoy the process of tinkering and sound design, even if it doesn't always lead to making music. Some commenters express skepticism about the practicality of the idea, suggesting that the problem might be more about the obsession with miniaturization rather than a lack of innovation in knob design. Finally, there’s interest in the potential for expanding the concept into more complex controls, like multi-directional knobs, but concerns about cost and complexity remain.
