Hello everyone, this is the 2025-12-19 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have a lot of interesting tech news, updates, and stories to share with you.

First, let’s talk about Mistral OCR 3, a new tool for turning pictures of documents into text and data. This new version is better than the old Mistral OCR 2, with much higher accuracy, especially on hard cases like handwritten notes, forms, and complex tables. Mistral OCR 3 can handle many types of documents, such as receipts, reports, invoices, and even low-quality scans. It can read handwriting, including cursive and mixed notes on printed pages. For forms, it finds boxes, labels, and even handwritten answers. It is also good with documents that have noise, skew, or low resolution.

A key feature is its skill with tables. It can rebuild tables with merged cells, headers, and special layouts, keeping the structure with HTML tags. This helps other programs understand both the text and the layout. Mistral OCR 3 is smaller and cheaper than many competitors. The price is $2 per 1,000 pages, and even less if you use the batch API. Developers can use it with an API, or anyone can try it in a web app by dragging and dropping documents to get clean text or structured data.

This new version is for both big companies and small teams. Use cases include scanning archives, extracting data from invoices, digitizing handwritten papers, and making search tools smarter. Early customers are already using it for these tasks. The article shares that Mistral OCR 3 outperforms other popular OCR tools in real-world tests and is ready to use today. It is also backward compatible with Mistral OCR 2.

In the comments, some users are excited about the better accuracy and low price, saying it could help small businesses and hobbyists, not just big companies. A few developers want open-source or self-hosted options, especially for processing sensitive data. Others are curious how it compares to Google OCR, Tesseract, and Azure Form Recognizer, and want to know more about its performance on non-English documents and poor scans. There are technical questions about API limits, speed, and if it works offline. Some share stories about past OCR struggles, especially with old family letters or forms full of handwriting, and warn that no OCR is perfect—real-world documents often need cleaning after automatic processing. People also like the step forward in keeping table structure, and hope the markdown and HTML output will make integration easier. Overall, the community sees Mistral OCR 3 as a promising tool, but some want more transparency and tests on difficult data.

Next, we have news about Garage, a new software that lets you set up your own S3-compatible object storage, even outside big datacenters. The main idea is to make storage easy, reliable, and simple to use, even with old or mixed hardware. Garage is just one small file, works on almost any Linux computer, and only needs 1 GB of RAM and 16 GB of storage. You can mix any machines together in a cluster, even second-hand ones.

Garage is easy for system administrators and is made to be fast to start, safe to run, and handle problems like slow networks or disk failures. The project uses ideas from new research in distributed systems and has received funding from EU programs. In the comments, people liked the simple design, low resource needs, and the fact that it works outside datacenters or in areas with slow internet. Some asked about data loss, backups, and how Garage compares to other storage options like MinIO or Ceph. There were questions about security and guides for setup. Some shared stories about running storage from home or small offices. Not everyone is sure if Garage is ready for big companies or very important data yet, but many agree it is a fun and useful project.

Moving on, there is a security story about the TP-Link Tapo C200 home camera. A security researcher used AI tools to reverse engineer the camera’s firmware and found several serious bugs. The firmware for all TP-Link devices can be downloaded easily from an open cloud folder, with no password needed. The firmware is encrypted, but the keys are published in TP-Link’s own open-source code, so anyone can unlock it. The researcher found a buffer overflow in XML message reading, an integer overflow in the HTTPS server, and a way to change the camera’s WiFi settings without a password, even after setup. There is also a bug that lets anyone nearby scan for WiFi networks with the camera, again with no password. These problems are serious because there are at least 25,000 such cameras exposed on the internet, and the HTTPS private key is the same for all devices.

In the comments, many readers are shocked at how easy it is to get the firmware and the keys. People say it is very careless for a security camera company to publish the same decryption keys for all devices. Some blame users for buying cheap cameras, but others say normal people can’t be expected to know about these risks. There are talks about how hard it is to secure IoT devices at scale and that companies often care more about selling devices than keeping users safe. Some people share tips on how to block these cameras from the internet, while others say the only safe way is not to use such cameras at all. Many are frustrated by the slow response from TP-Link and think the CVE system should be more independent.

Now, let’s look at the news that Graphite, a company known for its code review platform, has been bought by Cursor. Code review and teamwork are now seen as the slowest part of software development, even though writing code has changed a lot. Graphite helps many engineers review and manage code better. The founders believe the line between writing code and working together is not clear anymore, and joining with Cursor will let them build new tools to make these tasks easier.

Graphite will keep running as its own product, but over the next few months, it will connect more closely with Cursor. This could mean better ways to move from writing code to making pull requests, or smarter code review features. The team hints at new ideas, but gives no details yet. In the comments, some people are excited and hope this will make code review faster and less painful. Others worry that being part of a bigger company might change or remove the good things about Graphite. Some want real improvements, not just new features that look nice. There is hope that these changes will help both open source projects and big companies, but people are a bit cautious.

Next, Mullvad VPN has made a new version of WireGuard called GotaTun, written in Rust. This is not a new VPN protocol, but a rewrite of the normal WireGuard code in Rust, based on BoringTun from Cloudflare. Mullvad added privacy features like DAITA and Multihop, and used special Rust programming ways like multi-threading and zero-copy memory to make the app faster and use less battery. The main reason for making GotaTun was problems with wireguard-go, the earlier Go-based version used in Mullvad’s app, which caused most crashes on Android.

Since switching to GotaTun, Mullvad saw a big drop in crash reports and users say the app feels faster and uses less battery. Mullvad plans to bring GotaTun to all their apps soon and will get a security check from outside experts. In the comments, people praise Mullvad for using Rust, saying it helps make VPN apps safer and more reliable. Some are curious if GotaTun can become as trusted as the original WireGuard in C and ask about the future security audit. Others like the open sharing of crash data and wonder if GotaTun will be open source and useful for other VPN apps. Most are excited to see more VPN tools being built in Rust.

There is also big news from Amazon. Amazon will soon let people download DRM-free eBooks in ePub and PDF formats. This change will start in 2026 for books sold through Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP). Before this, Amazon mainly used its own format, and many books had DRM, making it hard to read them on other devices. Now, with ePub and PDF, people can read books on many devices, not just Kindles. DRM-free means no digital lock stopping you from copying or moving your books. Authors can choose to offer their books in these open formats, which could help readers, libraries, and schools.

In the comments, people are happy about this move, saying it is good for readers’ rights and book ownership. Some hope other companies will follow Amazon. There are some worries that publishers might still add DRM, so not every book will be open. Some like that PDF is included, which works well for technical books. Writers are excited to have more control over their books, and many hope this will help with long-term access, so people do not lose their libraries. Overall, the community sees this as a big, positive step.

Next, we have a fun and creative story. Musician Linus Åkesson performed Ravel’s Boléro using homemade 8-bit instruments. He spent over half a year making the video and used nine different custom instruments, like the Qweremin, Chipophone, and even a floppy-drive noise instrument. Linus recorded over 9 hours of footage and mixed 52 channels of audio. He built an automaton to help with the performance and used tricks from old NES games for special sounds. Most of the video and audio was recorded live.

The comments are full of praise. People call the video amazing and have great respect for Linus’s skill. Some musicians say this is better than most music today, especially compared to AI-generated songs, and that Linus shows true art and creativity. Many mention the clever technical tricks and love the sound of the old machines. Some people think this kind of effort shows why human-made music still matters.

For developers, there is a new guide about making C++ programs run faster, sharing many tips from years of experience at Google. The authors explain why performance matters, when to care about it, and how to measure and improve it. They say you should not ignore performance from the start, and share ways to estimate the cost of your code, like using simple math and tables for memory or disk access. Profiling tools like pprof or perf help measure real speed. Writing small benchmarks helps check if changes really make the code faster.

To speed up code, they suggest using bulk APIs, compact data structures, inlining storage for small containers, and better algorithms. They also discuss reducing logging in hot paths, shrinking code size, and exploiting parallelism. For parallel code, keep lock sections short and shard data structures when possible. In the comments, many people agree with the tips, saying that measuring before optimizing is important and that better algorithms bring the biggest gains. Some warn that focusing too much on small optimizations can waste time, and that readability and maintainability still matter. Many thank the authors for sharing deep experience and clear examples.

There is also a new JavaScript library called TinyPDF for making PDFs. It is very small, just 3kb, about 70 times smaller than jsPDF. TinyPDF has no dependencies and uses less than 400 lines of code. You can make real PDF files with a few commands—add text, rectangles, lines, and JPEG images. You can control text size, color, and alignment, and it supports multiple pages and Markdown to PDF. It is good for making simple documents like invoices and receipts.

TinyPDF does not support advanced features like custom fonts or encryption, but for many projects, its size and simplicity are a big advantage. In the comments, people like how small and simple it is, and say it is perfect for small jobs. Some want more features, but most agree the trade-off makes sense. There is talk about the value of zero dependencies and keeping things easy to add to projects.

Finally, there is an article about a coding style in Rust called the “block pattern.” This means using blocks of code as expressions, so you can keep helper variables inside a block and only return the final result. This keeps the rest of the function cleaner and makes it clear what you are trying to do. The pattern helps keep variables alive only as long as needed, and makes code safer from unwanted changes.

Many commenters say they use this pattern, even if they never gave it a name. Some like that it keeps functions tidy and helps with managing variable scope. Others say that sometimes it is better to split complex logic into functions, especially if the block gets big. People agree that the block pattern is handy, especially for keeping code focused and safe.

That’s all for today’s episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Thank you for listening, and see you next time!
