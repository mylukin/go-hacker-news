## Defeating a 40-year-old copy protection dongle

This article is about breaking (or "defeating") a 40-year-old hardware dongle used for copy protection on old accounting software. The author helped a friend’s accounting firm move away from very old software that only worked if a special dongle was plugged into the computer.

The software was written in RPG, an old programming language, and ran on a Windows 98 machine in DOS mode. The dongle was attached to the computer’s parallel port; without it, the software would not run. The author took a disk image of the old computer and tried to run it in an emulator, but again, the dongle was needed. He found the source code, compiler, and batch files for the software, and noticed the compiler was the part that checked for the dongle. This check was built into every program the compiler made.

To understand how the dongle check worked, the author used a disassembler called Reko. The check was a short piece of code that talked to the parallel port and always returned a constant value in a register called BX. This meant the dongle check could be defeated by patching just four bytes in the code to always return the correct value.

After some guessing and brute force, the author found the “magic number” the program wanted: 7606h. He changed the code to always return this number, which made the software think the dongle was always present. The same patch worked for every program made by the compiler.

In the comments, some people were surprised that the dongle protection was so simple and could be broken with a tiny code change. Others remembered similar dongles from old software and said many could be bypassed if you figured out the expected value. Some thought the dongle was not really secure, just enough to stop casual copying, but not experts. A few commenters discussed how hardware dongles are used in modern software and if they are still useful. Others enjoyed the “software archaeology” aspect and said it’s important to save old programs and tools. One person pointed out that brute forcing the value was smart and quick since there were only 256 options. Another commenter wondered if the dongle ever did anything more complicated, but most agreed it was just a basic check. Some people shared stories about dongles they had used, and how easy or hard they were to crack. A few were amazed that a business was still using Windows 98 and such old software in 2026. Lastly, some thanked the author for planning to release the old compiler, saying it’s important to keep computing history alive.

## Show HN: NanoClaw – “Clawdbot” in 500 lines of TS with Apple container isolation

- 原文链接: [Show HN: NanoClaw – “Clawdbot” in 500 lines of TS with Apple container isolation](https://github.com/gavrielc/nanoclaw)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46850205)

NanoClaw is a small personal assistant for Claude AI that runs inside Apple containers on macOS. It is made to be simple, secure, and easy to change for your own needs.

The project is only about 500 lines of TypeScript. It uses Linux containers for real isolation, so your AI agents cannot see files on your Mac unless you allow it. Most other assistants run everything in one big process, but NanoClaw puts each group and task in its own sandbox. There are no complex layers or many dependencies—just a few files you can read and understand fast. It connects to WhatsApp, so you can talk to your assistant from your phone. Each group you make has its own memory and its own container, so chats and data do not mix by mistake. You can schedule tasks like daily reports or news briefings, and even ask the assistant to change its behavior using natural language. If you want new features, you do not add them as code to the main project. You add “skills” (small scripts) that teach Claude how to change or grow your own fork. This keeps the main system clean and small. Setup is guided by Claude Code, not by a normal wizard or big config files. If you want to change something, you just talk to the AI and it helps you do it. There are no dashboards or big config files—just code and chat. The project is built for macOS and runs best there, but you can use Claude to help port it to Linux or even Windows. Security is strong, because each agent is locked in a container and can only touch files you say yes to. The code is open, under the MIT license.

In the Hacker News comments, some people love how small and clear the codebase is. They say it is rare to see an AI project you can really read and trust. Many like the idea of using Apple’s built-in containers for speed and safety, instead of Docker or other heavy tools. Some users wish it supported other chat apps like Telegram or Signal, but agree the skill system makes this easy to add. Others ask if it could work on Linux or Windows; the answer is yes, but you need to tweak it, and Claude can help you with that. A few worry that Apple’s containers are new and may not be stable, or that most people do not use WhatsApp as their main chat app. Some think the “no config files” idea is nice for short setups but could become messy for big changes. There are questions about how secure the system can really be if you let the AI change its own code, but most agree the small size makes reviews easy. People like that you do not need to share your data or API keys with a cloud service, and that setup is clear and honest about what it does. Overall, most comments are positive, and many are curious to try NanoClaw for their own AI projects.

## Apple I Advertisement (1976)

- 原文链接: [Apple I Advertisement (1976)](http://apple1.chez.com/Apple1project/Gallery/Gallery.htm)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46847780)

This article shares an old Apple I advertisement from 1976 and shows pictures of the computer. The ad talks about how the Apple I was a big step forward for home computers at the time.

The Apple I was sold as a single board with a built-in video terminal and 8K RAM, and it used the MOS 6502 processor. You could use a normal TV or monitor as a display, and connect any ASCII keyboard. The price was $666.66, which was low compared to other computers then. The computer came fully assembled and tested, so users could start quickly without building anything. It was quieter, cheaper, and faster than the old teletype machines, and could display 24 rows of 40 characters. People didn’t need to use switches or blinking lights to enter programs anymore; everything could be done with the keyboard and screen. The RAM used new 4K chips, which were smaller and used less power, and the system could be expanded up to 65K RAM. There was a cassette interface for saving and loading programs, which worked with almost any tape recorder. Apple also gave away BASIC and other software for free or at a low price, which was rare. The ad invites stores and dealers to sell the Apple I and encourages people to ask their local shop to stock it.

In the comments, many people are amazed by the low price, noting how affordable it was for the technology offered. Some remember how hard it was to get started with early computers and how exciting it was to use a keyboard and screen instead of switches. Others point out that $666.66 was still a lot of money in 1976, but it was less than other computers like the Altair. A few talk about how the built-in video terminal was a big deal because most computers then needed special equipment to display text. Some users laugh about the strange price and wonder if it was a joke. Others share stories about seeing or using an Apple I, saying it felt like magic at the time. There are comments about how Apple’s focus on ease-of-use and ready-to-run machines helped them stand out. Some people discuss the simple design and how few chips were used, making it reliable. Others compare the Apple I to modern computers, saying it’s amazing how far things have come. Many feel nostalgia for the early days of home computing and admire Steve Wozniak’s clever engineering.

## We (As a Society) Peaked in the 90s

- 原文链接: [We (As a Society) Peaked in the 90s](https://chris.pagecord.com/we-as-a-society-peaked-in-the-90s)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46850350)

This article says that life in the 1990s had a special balance between technology and real life. The writer thinks society was at its best then, before things changed too much.

He talks about music first. In the 90s, computers made music better, but they did not replace real bands or people playing together. Music felt more personal and real. The internet was new and exciting. You could find cool information or weird websites, and then you’d go outside or do something else. Technology was not the center of life.

Most people had simple things like a CD player, a basic phone, or a game console. You bought it once and used it until it broke. There were no subscriptions or constant updates. Photos were special—you took one because it mattered, and you had to wait to see how it turned out. Sometimes pictures were bad, sometimes great, and that was okay.

Everything moved slower: you waited for things, and that was normal. Waiting was just part of life. People worked hard and could see what they made at the end of the day. You could tell when someone loved something because it took real effort. Albums, games, and software came out slowly, and people enjoyed them longer.

Local businesses were important too. They were about work and community, not big brands. People did not know everything about each other, which gave everyone more privacy. You could disappear for a while or change, and nobody was watching or judging.

He knows the 90s were not perfect, but he misses the balance between technology and real life. He thinks that now technology controls us more than we control it.

Many comments agree with his feelings. Some say life felt less stressful and more free in the 90s. Others remember enjoying music, games, and meeting friends without social media. A few point out that technology has brought good things too, like easy communication and access to knowledge.

Some people say that every generation feels nostalgia for when they grew up. Others argue that the 90s had problems too, like less access to information or fewer choices. A few remind readers that nostalgia can make the past seem better than it really was.

Some commenters miss slower life and fewer online distractions. Others warn against ignoring progress and the benefits of today’s technology. There are debates about privacy, freedom, and the value of real community. Many agree that balance is important, and wish life could be a bit more like the 90s—simple, slower, and more real.

## My thousand dollar iPhone can't do math

- 原文链接: [My thousand dollar iPhone can't do math](https://journal.rafaelcosta.me/my-thousand-dollar-iphone-cant-do-math/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46849258)

This article is about a developer who bought a new iPhone 16 Pro Max for over $1,000 and found it could not run machine learning models correctly, while his older iPhone 15 Pro and MacBook Pro worked fine. He tried to build a small expense tracking app using AI to categorize purchases, but ran into trouble when the app only gave nonsense answers on the new phone. He first blamed his code, then the Apple Intelligence features, and finally the machine learning frameworks, spending days debugging and comparing outputs between devices. He found that on his iPhone 16 Pro Max, the internal numbers (tensors) produced by the AI model were completely wrong—sometimes by 10 times or more—while the same code and model worked on his older devices. After lots of testing, he realized the problem happened only on the new phone, which had been replaced by Apple Care after an accident. He guessed the issue was with the phone’s special AI hardware, the Neural Engine, or maybe how Apple’s software used it. The error was not common, but he pointed out that many people online seemed to have similar problems with Apple’s AI features not working. He ended up trading in the broken phone for a new iPhone 17 Pro Max, which worked perfectly, proving the old one was just faulty hardware.

In the comments, many developers were surprised and worried that expensive new hardware could have such hidden defects. Some said it’s easy to blame yourself or your code when things go wrong, and this story is a reminder to check for hardware problems too. People talked about how hard it is to debug machine learning issues, especially when the same code gives different results on different devices. Others wondered if Apple’s quality control is getting worse, or if their new AI features are just not ready. A few commenters said they avoid buying the newest iPhones for this reason, preferring to wait for bugs to be fixed. Some praised the author for carefully testing and comparing, while others shared their own stories of strange hardware bugs. There was also debate about whether Apple makes it too hard for users to see what’s really happening inside their devices. In the end, most agreed that hardware bugs are rare but can be very hard to find, especially with advanced features like AI. Many thanked the author for sharing the story, since it might help others facing the same confusing issues.

## Netbird – Open Source Zero Trust Networking

- 原文链接: [Netbird – Open Source Zero Trust Networking](https://netbird.io/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46844870)

NetBird is an open-source tool that helps companies create secure private networks following the “zero trust” model. It uses WireGuard for encrypted connections and lets teams manage who can access what, all from a simple interface.

The main idea is to give only the needed access to each user or device. NetBird lets you set rules, check device security, and require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for extra safety. You can use single sign-on (SSO) with Okta, Microsoft, or Google accounts, making it easy to manage users as your team grows. It works on many systems, like Linux, Windows, Mac, mobile phones, Docker, and even some routers. 

You don’t have to open extra ports or change your firewall rules—NetBird handles this for you. It lets you connect cloud networks and on-premise servers quickly. You can group devices, set DNS rules, and watch network activity with detailed logs. It also works with security tools (like MDM and EDR) to check if devices are safe before letting them connect.

NetBird is open source and can be self-hosted, so you can run it on your own servers if you want. Many companies use it to replace old VPNs, saying it’s easier to set up, more secure, and less work to maintain. You can also automate setup using their API. The platform claims you can create a secure network in under five minutes.

In the Hacker News comments, some users are excited about having another open-source alternative to commercial zero-trust tools like Tailscale or OpenZiti. People like that NetBird is open source and can be self-hosted, which means you have more control and privacy. Some ask how it compares to Tailscale—many mention that NetBird is similar, but it uses a more permissive license and allows for self-hosting without any paid plans. Others are curious about how easy it is to set up in real-world business cases.

A few users bring up concerns about scaling and performance for large networks, and ask about possible single points of failure. Some praise the use of WireGuard, calling it fast and secure, while others point out that company adoption depends on good support and documentation. There’s also discussion about how NetBird manages device posture checks and integrates with existing identity providers. Finally, some users share their own success stories running NetBird in production, saying it solved their network headaches and improved security.

## Kiki – The accountability monster for people who are easily distracted

- 原文链接: [Kiki – The accountability monster for people who are easily distracted](https://www.kiki.computer/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46849078)

This article is about Kiki, a tool made to help people who get distracted easily and want to be more productive. Kiki works by making you focus on one task at a time, blocking all apps and websites except the ones you really need.

To use Kiki, you first write down the one thing you want to do—like “write essay introduction.” Next, you choose which apps and sites you are allowed to use for that task. Kiki blocks everything else, so you can’t visit Instagram or other distracting sites. When you start, Kiki creates a “distraction-free zone” for the time you set. You have to stay focused until your session is over—there is no way to quit early. Kiki also tracks your focus and shows you how well you did over time. The makers say that focusing on one thing at a time (single-tasking) makes people much more productive. There are funny testimonials from users who say Kiki helped them stop scrolling, finish work before a deadline, or even kept them in Excel until they finished a big spreadsheet. Kiki costs $4.99 a month or $29.88 a year, and it works with Chrome and Safari browsers. The app jokes that it will judge your bad time management and that you can’t trick it. The creators argue that Kiki is better than other apps because it doesn’t just suggest you focus—it forces you to do it.

In the comments, some people like the idea and say they need strong tools like this to help them stop wasting time online. Others think the strict blocking is too much and might not work for everyone—some people need to take breaks or use different apps for creative work. A few users point out that self-control is important, and that you can’t depend only on software to change habits. Some mention that similar tools already exist, but they like the fun, playful style of Kiki. One commenter jokes that Kiki sounds scary, while another says the price is fair if it really helps save time. Others discuss technical issues, like worries about privacy or needing support for more browsers. Some people share stories about trying to cheat tools like this and failing, while others ask for more features, like better reports or mobile support. A few note that even strong tools can become annoying if you really need to switch tasks quickly. Overall, the comments show a mix of excitement, doubt, and jokes about how hard it is to stay focused online.

## Efficient String Compression for Modern Database Systems

- 原文链接: [Efficient String Compression for Modern Database Systems](https://cedardb.com/blog/string_compression/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46826011)

This article talks about how CedarDB now uses a new way to make text data smaller and faster called FSST (Fast Static Symbol Table). Many databases store lots of data as strings, which use much space and can be slow to search, so finding a better way to store and use them is important.

First, the article explains why strings matter: they are very common, and many queries use strings to find data. Making strings smaller not only saves disk space (and money), but also makes searches faster, because smaller data moves faster between memory and CPU. Before FSST, CedarDB mainly used something called dictionary compression. With this, all unique strings are put in a dictionary, and the data is stored as small numbers pointing to the dictionary. This works well for data with many repeated values. It also makes searching faster because you can compare small numbers instead of long strings. But if there are too many different strings, the dictionary gets too big.

FSST works like a smart tokenizer: it finds common parts of strings (up to 8 bytes) and stores them as short codes (1 byte each). It builds a table of these codes and uses them to make the original data much smaller. FSST is fast because the symbol table fits in the CPU cache, and it works in two steps: first, it builds the table from a sample of the data, then it compresses the data using that table. Decompressing is also fast: you just look up each code in the table to get the original string part.

CedarDB combines both methods: it builds a dictionary of unique strings, then compresses that dictionary using FSST. This keeps searches fast (because you still compare small numbers), but with even better compression. The system chooses to use FSST only if it makes the data much smaller (at least 40% smaller than other methods), because decompressing FSST can be slower than just using a dictionary.

Benchmarks show that FSST shrinks storage by 20–40%, even up to 60% for some data. For queries that read from disk (“cold runs”), FSST makes searches up to 40% faster, since less data needs to move from disk to memory. But for queries where the data is already in memory (“hot runs”), FSST can make things slower, sometimes up to 2–3 times, because decompressing FSST takes more CPU time than just reading from the dictionary.

In the Hacker News comments, some people liked the clear explanation of FSST and dictionary compression. A few said they used similar methods in their own projects, and they agreed that combining dictionary compression and FSST makes sense. Others pointed out that FSST is not new; DuckDB also uses it, so this isn’t the first time it’s been done. Some users asked about cases with very unique strings or short strings, and the article says FSST works best when there are common patterns in the data, but not as well if every string is very different.

One person wondered if compressing strings is always worth it, since the CPU cost can be high for some queries. Another suggested caching the decompressed strings for repeated queries, but others replied that this could use too much memory. Some liked the honest talk about trade-offs: you get smaller data, but sometimes slower queries, so you have to choose what’s most important for your use case. Finally, a few developers said they wanted to try CedarDB on their own data to see real results.

## I taught my neighbor to keep the volume down

- 原文链接: [I taught my neighbor to keep the volume down](https://idiallo.com/blog/teaching-my-neighbor-to-keep-the-volume-down)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46848415)

This story is about a person who moved into a new apartment and had trouble with a loud neighbor and their shared TV remotes. The main problem started when both the writer and the neighbor got the same RF remote for their Dish Network TV, which could control TVs through walls.

The writer noticed his TV was acting strange—changing channels and volume by itself. At first, he thought his remote was broken, but soon realized that his neighbor’s remote was on the same frequency and was controlling both TVs. After some testing, he found out he could also control his neighbor’s TV. Instead of using this power for fun, he tried to talk to his neighbor and explain the problem. But the neighbor was rude and didn’t listen.

So, the writer turned the situation into a lesson. Whenever the neighbor turned the TV up too loud, the writer would turn off the TV using the remote. Over time, the neighbor learned to keep the volume lower, because every time it got too loud, the TV turned off. This continued for weeks, until the neighbor finally started keeping the volume down. The writer calls this “Pavlovian conditioning,” meaning the neighbor learned a new habit because of repeating actions.

In the end, the writer never changed his remote’s frequency, but just used the IR remotes for his family. The RF remote stayed by his bed, ready to keep the peace at night.

In the comments, one person said they found the story funny and thanked the writer for sharing. On Hacker News, people shared different thoughts. Some said the writer was clever for using technology to solve the noise problem. Others wondered if it was fair to “train” a neighbor this way, or if it would have been better to keep trying to talk. A few people mentioned similar issues with wireless devices interfering in apartments, and joked about how “RF wars” can happen in close living spaces. Some readers felt bad that the neighbor wasn’t willing to listen, while others enjoyed the creative solution. A couple of comments discussed technical ways to fix RF interference, like setting different remote codes, but also admitted that not everyone reads the manual. Some thought the writer was patient, while others said they might have just called building management. Overall, people liked the story and found it a good example of turning a tech problem into a funny life lesson.
