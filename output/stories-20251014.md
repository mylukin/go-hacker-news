This article is about a secret investigation into First Wap, a company that sells powerful phone-tracking software called Altamides. Reporters found a huge archive of data showing that many people all over the world were tracked, not just criminals but also journalists, business leaders, and even regular people.

The investigation started when a reporter found data on the deep web with more than 1.5 million records of location tracking. The team worked to match phone numbers to real people and found victims in over 160 countries. Some of the people tracked were famous or important, like former political leaders, business founders, journalists, and activists. There were also everyday people targeted, such as teachers and therapists.

First Wap claims it sells its technology only to governments for fighting crime and terror. But the reporters found evidence that private companies and individuals also used the tools, sometimes to spy on opponents or even stalk people. The software was sold through secret channels and often ended up in the hands of people who should not have it. Companies like the British KCS Group tried to sell the tracking system to governments during the Arab Spring and also used it for business investigations.

The technology behind Altamides works by exploiting a weakness in the global phone network called SS7. This lets someone track any phone's location, intercept messages, and even listen to calls or break into apps like WhatsApp. First Wap kept a low profile for years, avoiding public attention, while its business grew worldwide.

To test how careful First Wap is with its clients, reporters pretended to be buyers at a surveillance tech fair. The company’s executive, Günther Rudolph, admitted selling to people under sanctions is risky but suggested ways to hide the deals, like using fake companies in other countries.

When questioned, First Wap denied doing anything illegal and said it always checks clients. They also said they do not track people themselves, only sell the tools.

In the comments, many readers were shocked at how widespread and easy this kind of surveillance has become. Some pointed out that weaknesses in phone networks like SS7 have been known for years, but nothing much was done to fix them. Others worried that regular people have almost no way to protect themselves from this kind of tracking. A few said it is not just one company, but a whole industry with many players, and governments also use these tools. Some users argued that selling such powerful tools without strict controls is dangerous. Others wondered if this kind of reporting would help push for new laws or better phone security. There was also debate about whether companies like First Wap can really be held responsible if they claim not to know what their clients do. Some readers said that more transparency and public attention might be the only way to stop misuse. Overall, people agreed that this is a serious problem that is bigger than just one company.

## AppLovin Nonconsensual Installs

- 原文链接: [AppLovin Nonconsensual Installs](https://www.benedelman.org/applovin-nonconsensual-installs/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45584226)

This article explains that AppLovin, a big mobile ad company, is installing apps on Android devices without user consent. The author, Ben Edelman, looks at code and user complaints to show this is happening.

He checks AppLovin’s code using a decompiler and finds that, after a user clicks an ad—even by mistake—another app may be installed right away. The code is hard to read because it is obfuscated, but the process is still clear. Edelman also finds some important steps in JavaScript code. Sometimes, users get no warning before the install; other times, there is a countdown or a tiny X button to cancel, which is hard to tap. If the user does not press cancel in time, the app installs automatically. He collects more than 200 complaints from users who say they did not agree to install these apps. Some users even share screenshots and a video, which match the code’s behavior. Many users blame helper apps from Samsung or T-Mobile, but these helpers are just following AppLovin’s instructions.

AppLovin’s CEO says every install is a user’s clear choice, but Edelman disagrees. He says a very small X or a time limit is not real consent. Usually, people expect to see a big Install button and a clear choice. AppLovin’s public statements use words like “explicit user choice,” but the evidence shows otherwise.

Edelman also discusses why companies like Samsung or T-Mobile allow this. He thinks they might get paid, or maybe they allowed installs only during device setup, but failed to limit it. There are no technical checks to stop AppLovin from installing apps at any time, not just when a phone is new.

Edelman uses five kinds of evidence: code analysis, code labels, special permissions, user complaints (with screenshots and video), and AppLovin’s own public statements. All these sources point to the same problem—apps get installed without real user agreement. He also mentions legal and financial risks for AppLovin.

In the comments, many people are shocked that this is allowed on Android devices. Some blame Samsung and T-Mobile for giving AppLovin so much power. Others say Android’s permission system is too weak and allows abuse. A few users argue that app makers and ad companies often stretch the rules if money is involved. Some developers say the code analysis is detailed and shows clear proof. A few comments defend AppLovin, saying users should be more careful where they tap, but most people think the X button is too small on purpose. Some ask why Google is not stopping this, while others think it will hurt trust in Android. A few worry about privacy and security if unknown apps can install themselves. There is also debate about whether this is legal, and if users can sue. Lastly, some readers share their own stories of unwanted apps showing up on their phones, which matches the article’s findings.

## How bad can a $2.97 ADC be?

- 原文链接: [How bad can a $2.97 ADC be?](https://excamera.substack.com/p/how-bad-can-a-297-adc-be)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45582462)

This article is about testing a cheap $2.97 ADC (analog-to-digital converter) called ADS1115, which helps measure voltages with high accuracy. The writer usually uses ADCs built into microcontrollers, but those are not very precise, often giving only about 8 or 9 useful bits even if they say 12 or 16 bits.

The ADS1115 is a dedicated chip that promises true 16-bit readings. It has a special feature called a programmable gain amplifier (PGA), letting you measure very small voltages much more accurately than a regular microcontroller ADC. For example, with the PGA set to a small range, each step measures about 7.8 microvolts, much finer than the usual 6 millivolts.

Another good thing is the ADS1115 has its own voltage reference, so you do not need an extra precise voltage source. The writer notices that the price of these chips varies a lot—about $4 from one seller, but only $0.60 from another. He bought some cheap boards from Amazon and plans to compare them with a more expensive version from Adafruit.

He tested the cheap boards with his equipment. At first, they seemed to work well—they showed 16-bit outputs, the gain settings worked, and the readings were close to correct values. However, when he looked more closely, there were problems. One chip gave the wrong number of samples per second, working much faster (and noisier) than it should. The voltage readings were also off by about 0.5%, which is much more error than what the chip's official documents promise.

Still, he found that a simple software correction could make the measurements very accurate. The writer guesses these cheap chips are either very good copies or failed parts that were not supposed to be sold but ended up in hobby stores. He plans to test the expensive chip next and compare.

In the comments, some people say cheap electronics from random sellers often have quality issues or are fake. Others say that for hobby projects, these small errors do not matter, and cheap parts are fine. Some readers warn that using these in professional products could be risky because you cannot trust every chip to work the same. A few commenters talk about seeing similar problems with other cheap modules, like chips that are relabeled or recycled. Some people are impressed that the cheap ADCs work as well as they do, given the price. Others remind everyone to always double-check important measurements, no matter what part you use. A few mention that software calibration is often needed for all ADC chips, not just cheap ones. Someone suggests that testing and picking the good chips from a batch is a common solution. Another person says this shows why it is good to buy parts from official distributors if you need guaranteed performance. Finally, some are just curious to see the results from the more expensive Adafruit board.

## The Day My Smart Vacuum Turned Against Me

- 原文链接: [The Day My Smart Vacuum Turned Against Me](https://codetiger.github.io/blog/the-day-my-smart-vacuum-turned-against-me/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45503560)

This story is about a person who bought a smart vacuum cleaner and found out it was sending lots of data to its maker without asking. The main point is about privacy, control, and what can go wrong with smart home devices.

The writer first noticed the vacuum was always talking to servers in another country. Wanting more privacy, they blocked the vacuum from sending logs to these servers. After that, the vacuum slowly stopped working, even though it should have worked offline. Sending it to the service center only fixed it for a short time. The vacuum would always die again after a while at home.

Curious, the writer opened the vacuum and explored its hardware. They found it was a small computer running Linux, with many sensors and a microcontroller. They made new connections, wrote Python scripts to test the sensors, and even built a joystick controller with a Raspberry Pi.

Next, the writer found a hidden USB port. Using it, they got root access to the vacuum’s computer without any password. They also found the vacuum used Google Cartographer, a top tool for making maps of rooms. More shocking, they found a script in the system that could stop the vacuum from working. The logs showed a remote “kill command” was sent to their device at the exact time it stopped working.

The writer learned the service center just reconnected the vacuum to the internet, letting the company revive it. But when back home and blocked again, the vacuum was quickly disabled. The vacuum had “rtty” installed, a tool that let the company control it from anywhere.

This meant the company could punish customers who blocked data sharing by turning off their devices. The same hardware is used in many other brands, so the problem could affect lots of people. In the end, the writer set up the vacuum to run offline, blocking all outside access and sharing all their findings online.

Many top comments on Hacker News were shocked by how much control companies have over “smart” devices. Some readers said this shows why you should always put smart gadgets on a separate network, not your main WiFi. Others pointed out this is why they avoid cloud-connected devices altogether and prefer “dumb” ones. Some people thought the company’s actions were wrong or even illegal, calling it “retaliation” for wanting privacy.

A few comments discussed how hard it is to trust cheap smart products, since low prices often mean poor security or hidden costs. Some readers were impressed by the writer’s technical skill and curiosity to reverse-engineer the vacuum. Others worried about the future, noting that more and more home devices are being sold this way.

Some agreed that most users would never know or care about these problems, so the practice is likely to continue. Others hoped stories like this would push companies to be more honest about what their devices do. A few readers shared their own experiences with similar devices being bricked or made useless by the manufacturer after blocking cloud features.

Overall, the discussion showed strong support for user control, privacy, and the right to repair. Many said they learned something new and would think twice before buying more “smart” home gadgets.

## How AI hears accents: An audible visualization of accent clusters

- 原文链接: [How AI hears accents: An audible visualization of accent clusters](https://accent-explorer.boldvoice.com/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45581735)

This article looks at how AI can understand and group different English accents from around the world. The team at BoldVoice used a special AI model to map out how accents cluster together, then built an online tool so people can listen and see these accent groups.

The model they used is called HuBERT, which was trained on a huge amount of English speech from people who speak over 200 languages. This model listens to raw audio and learns to guess which accent is being spoken. It does not use any text, just the sound itself. They trained the model for a week using very powerful computers. To show the results, they reduced the AI’s complex internal data to a 3D map using a method called UMAP. In this map, each point is a short bit of speech, colored by the speaker’s accent.

For privacy, they use a "voice standardization" step so you only hear the accent, not the person’s real voice. This helps protect users and makes it easier to compare accents without being distracted by other things like gender or noise.

The map shows some surprising things. For example, accents from places that are far apart on a language tree still group together if people have moved between those places or share history. The Australian and Vietnamese accents are close, possibly because some Vietnamese speakers in Australia have developed a blend of both. The French, Nigerian, and Ghanaian accents also cluster together, maybe due to migration or colonial history. In India, accents from the south (like Telugu and Tamil) are grouped together, while Bengali and Nepali are grouped at the other end, matching their real-world geography.

The Mongolian and Korean accents are close too, even though experts now say their languages are not related. The AI seems to pick up on how these accents sound, not just their language roots. The article says these findings can help build better tools for learning pronunciation.

People in the comments are impressed by the visualization and how it makes accent data easy to explore and listen to. Some think the clustering makes sense and matches what they know about migration and language contact. Others worry that the voice standardization step might change the accent too much and hide real details. A few users ask about privacy and how user data is handled. Some linguists in the comments discuss whether the clusters truly show real-life similarities or if they are artifacts from the model or data. One person points out that human listeners might group accents differently than the AI does. Others suggest more research and comparisons with classic linguistic maps.

Overall, the community finds the project interesting and useful, though some have questions about the methods and possible biases. Many agree it could help learners and teachers understand accents better. Some also wonder how the tool could be expanded to include other languages or dialects.

## What do Americans die from vs. what the news report on

- 原文链接: [What do Americans die from vs. what the news report on](https://ourworldindata.org/does-the-news-reflect-what-we-die-from)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45583336)

This article looks at what Americans actually die from and what gets reported in big news outlets like the New York Times, Washington Post, and Fox News. It compares real causes of death in the US to the topics that get the most news coverage.

Most Americans die from things like heart disease and cancer, which together make up more than half of all deaths. But these causes only get a small share of news coverage—just 7%. Instead, the news talks much more about rare but dramatic events, such as homicides and terrorism. For example, terrorism caused only 16 deaths in 2023, but stories about it take up a big part of the news. The article explains that all three news outlets, even though they have different political views, still report on the same kinds of stories. Homicides and terrorism are mentioned far more than their actual share of deaths—homicides get 43 times more coverage, and terrorism gets over 18,000 times more.

The reason for this bias is that news wants to tell us what’s new and exciting. Common causes of death like heart disease happen every day and are not seen as interesting, while rare events feel more shocking and get people’s attention. People are more likely to click on stories about crime or disasters than about chronic diseases. The article also says that the news gives us a false picture of the world. If we mostly see stories about murder and terrorism, we might think these are common problems, even if they are not.

This false view has effects: people who see a lot of crime news are much more afraid of crime, even when crime rates are going down. Many still worry about terrorism, even though deaths from it are very rare. The article warns that this kind of reporting makes it hard to see real progress, for example, in falling cancer and heart disease death rates. In the end, the authors say we should be aware of this bias and not let the news shape our beliefs too much.

In the Hacker News comments, many users agreed that the media focuses too much on dramatic stories and ignores common issues. Some pointed out that this is because news companies need clicks and money, so they follow what gets the most attention. Others said this pattern is not new—it’s just easier to notice now because we get news all the time from many places. A few people argued that news should still cover rare events because they are important to know about, even if they don’t happen often. Some wondered if more coverage of things like heart disease would help people live healthier lives, but others thought people might just ignore these stories. There was also discussion about how fear sells better than facts, and how easy it is to get a twisted view of the world from the news. Some commenters shared that they feel safer after turning off the news, while others said it's important to stay informed but not let news reports control your feelings. Overall, most agreed that knowing about this bias is important for everyone.

## Astronomers 'image' a mysterious dark object in the distant Universe

- 原文链接: [Astronomers 'image' a mysterious dark object in the distant Universe](https://www.mpg.de/25518363/1007-asph-astronomers-image-a-mysterious-dark-object-in-the-distant-universe-155031-x)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45580699)

Astronomers have found and "imaged" a dark, massive object in the distant universe, about 10 billion light years away. They did this by using many radio telescopes around the world, making a giant "super-telescope" to catch small changes in light caused by gravity.

This object is very heavy—about a million times the mass of our Sun—but it does not give off any light at all. The team could not see it with normal telescopes, so they used a special trick called gravitational lensing. This means the gravity from the dark object bends and changes the light coming from a galaxy far behind it. By looking at the way the light bent, scientists could "see" where the dark object was, even though it was invisible.

To study this, the team had to use new computer models and a lot of computer power. Their technique, called "gravitational imaging," is very sensitive and found the smallest dark object yet with this method. The object sits in a spot where the light forms a kind of arc, with a visible pinch—this is the clue something heavy but dark is there.

The discovery supports the "cold dark matter" theory. This theory says the universe is full of invisible "clumps" of dark matter, which help shape galaxies. The researchers now want to use their method to look for more dark objects like this, to check if their number matches what theories predict. If they find many or few, it might change what we think about dark matter.

In the Hacker News comments, some users are amazed by the technology, especially how telescopes can join together to make a virtual one as big as the Earth. Others talk about how hard it is to study something that does not shine and that scientists have to look for its effects on other things. A few point out this result is a big step for dark matter research, but also say it may not prove what dark matter really is. Some users ask if the object could be a black hole or a group of things, not just dark matter. Others wonder how sure we can be about these findings since the data and models are very complex. A few people say this is a good example of science checking its own ideas, and are excited about what will be found next. Some wish the article gave more simple details, while a few joke about how mysterious space still is. Overall, the community agrees this is a cool and important discovery, but also see there is a lot more to learn.

## Why your boss isn't worried about AI – "can't you just turn it off?"

- 原文链接: [Why your boss isn't worried about AI – "can't you just turn it off?"](https://boydkane.com/essays/boss)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45583180)

This article explains why many bosses and non-technical people are not worried about AI, thinking that if something goes wrong, you can just "turn it off" or fix it like regular software. The author says this is a big misunderstanding because AI and normal software work in very different ways.

In regular software, bugs are usually caused by mistakes in code. You can look through the code, find the problem, and fix it. Once you fix a bug, it usually does not come back, and the software becomes better over time. If you give the same input, you get the same output, and you can write software to match very specific needs.

But with modern AI, things are much less clear. Mistakes are not just in the code, but in the huge amounts of data used to train the AI. No one knows all the data an AI has seen—some datasets would take thousands of years to read by a person. When an AI makes a mistake, you cannot just check the code or the data to find out why. Even the AI creators do not really know why their AI does certain things. If you try to fix a problem by retraining, you cannot be sure it is really gone; it might come back in a new way with a different prompt. Also, small changes in input can cause big changes in output, so the AI is not very predictable.

With regular software, you can test and prove it works for what you want. With AI, you cannot control everything it does. Sometimes, AI surprises even its creators with new abilities, both good and bad. You can only test for known problems, not for all possible dangers.

In the comments, some readers agreed strongly with the author, saying that many people, even managers in tech, think of AI like normal software because that is what they know. Others shared stories about bosses who do not understand how unpredictable AI can be. Some commenters pointed out that even some developers do not understand how different AI is, especially when it comes to debugging or making changes.

A few people argued that while AI is hard to control, this is not so new—complex systems have always been hard to predict, and we have learned to live with some risk. Others said that AI companies should do a better job explaining these differences to non-technical staff and the public. There were also comments about how the gap between experts and regular people makes it hard to talk about AI risks in a useful way, and that more clear, simple language is needed to help everyone understand.

Some commenters worried that if managers keep thinking AI is easy to fix, they will push it into places where it can do harm, because they are not afraid of the risks. Others were hopeful that as more people learn about AI’s limits, they will become more careful. Finally, a few readers said this article helped them see why they feel confused when talking to non-technical friends or bosses about AI, and they plan to share it to help others understand.

## Ultrasound is ushering a new era of surgery-free cancer treatment

- 原文链接: [Ultrasound is ushering a new era of surgery-free cancer treatment](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20251007-how-ultrasound-is-ushering-a-new-era-of-surgery-free-cancer-treatment)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45514378)

This article talks about using ultrasound to treat cancer without surgery. Doctors are now using focused sound waves, not just for imaging, but to destroy tumors inside the body.

A scientist named Zhen Xu found out by accident that very short, fast ultrasound pulses could break up tissue more effectively. Her method, called histotripsy, uses sound waves to make tiny bubbles inside tumors. These bubbles quickly expand and pop, breaking the tumor apart. The patient’s immune system then cleans up the broken tissue. This treatment is non-invasive, does not use heat, and patients can often go home the same day. It is now approved for liver cancer in the US and UK, and it’s being tested for other cancers like kidney and pancreas.

There are some challenges. Histotripsy does not work well if bones block the sound waves or in organs filled with air, like lungs. There is also not enough long-term data yet, so doctors are not sure how often cancer comes back after this treatment. Some worry that breaking up tumors might spread cancer cells, but animal studies have not shown this.

Another way to use ultrasound is called HIFU (High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound). This method heats up and “cooks” the tumor. HIFU is used mainly for prostate cancer and helps patients recover faster than surgery. But it also cannot be used everywhere in the body, especially if the cancer has spread or is behind bones or air pockets.

Researchers are also testing ultrasound together with drugs or radiation. For example, ultrasound can make the blood-brain barrier open for a short time, letting medicine reach brain tumors. Ultrasound can also make tumors more visible to the immune system. Doctors hope that in the future, this could help the body attack cancer cells all through the body after treating just one tumor.

In the Hacker News comments, some people are excited about these new treatments, calling them a big step forward for cancer care. They like that the treatments are less painful and have fewer side effects than surgery or chemotherapy. Others are more cautious, pointing out the lack of long-term data and possible unknown risks. A few commenters are concerned about the cost and wonder if these treatments will be available for everyone, or only for rich patients. Some users discuss technical limits, like how ultrasound cannot reach deep tumors behind bones or in the lungs. Others share hope that as research continues, more cancers will become treatable this way. There are also stories from people who had traditional surgery for cancer, wishing these options were available earlier. Finally, some commenters ask about combining ultrasound with other treatments, and if this could make current therapies safer and more effective.

## A 12,000-year-old obelisk with a human face was found in Karahan Tepe

- 原文链接: [A 12,000-year-old obelisk with a human face was found in Karahan Tepe](https://www.trthaber.com/foto-galeri/karahantepede-12-bin-yil-oncesine-ait-insan-yuzlu-dikili-tas-bulundu/73912.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45498887)

A 12,000-year-old stone with a human face was found at Karahan Tepe in Turkey. This stone is special because it is the first time a T-shaped pillar from this area shows a human face carved into it. 

Before this, T-shaped stones found at places like Göbeklitepe had arms and hands carved on them, and people thought they represented humans. Now, with a clear face, experts say this is a big moment in the study of the Neolithic period. The face is carved with sharp lines, deep eye sockets, and a thick nose—details that look like other old human statues found at Karahan Tepe. 

This new find shows that people living 12,000 years ago had not only good skills with stone, but also ideas about self-expression and abstract thinking. Researchers say these T-shaped stones were more than just part of a building; they also had a symbolic meaning. With this face, it is clear the stones did not just stand for humans—they were made to show an actual human face for the first time. 

The discovery is part of the Taş Tepeler Project, where experts study how people first started to live in one place and how their beliefs changed. The work at Karahan Tepe and other sites in southeast Turkey gives us new clues about the very early days of human history.

In the comments, many people say this is an amazing find that could change what we know about early humans. Some are surprised that people from so long ago could make art like this. Others compare this to other old sites and wonder if there are even older works of art still to be found. A few commenters talk about how hard it must be to date something this old and ask how sure we can be about the 12,000-year age. There are also some who question if this really shows a face or if it could be something else. Some people think we should be careful about making big claims, but most agree it is an exciting discovery. A few also discuss what this means for our ideas about religion and culture in the very early days of humans. Overall, the comments show both excitement and curiosity about what we will learn next from this site.
