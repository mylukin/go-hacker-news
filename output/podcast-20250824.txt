Hello everyone, this is the 2025-08-24 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we bring you some of the most interesting stories and discussions from the world of technology, science, and software.

First, let’s look at SpaceX and their upcoming tenth Starship test flight. SpaceX is moving fast, aiming to improve the reliability of both the Starship and its Super Heavy booster after the last flight ended with a loss. This test will introduce hardware and operation changes based on lessons from earlier flights. The main goals include new landing burn tests, trying out different engine setups, and, for the first time, practicing payload deployment. The Super Heavy booster will fly out over the Gulf of America, do experiments like mid-air flipping, and test backup engines during landing burns. After separation, the booster will try to land using only two engines, ending with a splashdown in the ocean. Starship, the upper stage, will deploy eight fake Starlink satellites, attempt a Raptor engine restart in space, and test new heat shield designs, including metallic tiles and better cooling. Engineers have even removed some heat tiles to test Starship’s strength in weaker areas. The timeline shares all key moments, from tank filling to the booster’s landing attempt.

Hacker News users are amazed by SpaceX’s pace, with many praising the bold landing experiments and the company’s open sharing of technical details. Some worry about safety, especially with removed heat tiles. A few discuss the technical choices, like “hot stage” separation to save fuel. While some doubt Starship’s full reusability, others are excited to see risky new tests and wish NASA moved as fast. There’s also talk about the environmental impact from frequent launches and ocean landings. Many agree that real-world testing is the best way to improve, and lots of people are simply excited to watch the next launch live.

Next, we have a deep dive into the Parquet file format. Parquet is a popular data storage format, but its newer Version 2 is not widely used yet. The article explains that while the Version 2 spec is finished, many tools—like DuckDB and older versions of Python’s Pandas—do not fully support it. This makes it risky to use Version 2, since your files may not open everywhere. The author found this out the hard way while building a tool called Carpet, which had to switch back to Version 1 for compatibility.

Version 2 brings new ways to store and compress data, and a new Data Page V2 format. Some developers want better compression, while others care about how data is organized. Logical types, like dates or strings, are handled separately and keep changing. In machine learning, limitations of Parquet and ORC are pushing new formats like Nimble and LV2, but Parquet remains the standard for most engineers.

Tests show Version 2 can make files smaller and faster, especially with numeric data, but the gains are not always big. Reading and writing speeds are usually better, but only in some cases. The main problem is that many tools can’t read Version 2, so most people stick with Version 1.

In the comments, some readers complain about slow progress and want new features faster. Others say backward compatibility matters more, and it’s wise not to rush. There are stories of people trying Version 2 and running into problems with other tools. Some want the community to push for faster support, while others prefer caution. Even with new formats, most think Parquet will remain the main choice because it’s so well known.

Now, let’s talk about a personal project: someone posted their first game, “Reprobate,” built with a homemade game engine. The post links to the game’s website and says it’s the creator’s first project with their own engine. Making a game engine from scratch is hard work, but it gives full control and is a great way to learn how games really work. Homemade engines can be smaller and simpler, which is good for learning or running on older hardware.

In the comments, people congratulate the creator and praise the effort to finish both a game and an engine. Some ask about the engine’s design, language choice, and if the source code will be shared. Others suggest more features or share their own stories about making games and engines. There’s a friendly debate about why build a new engine when so many exist, with fans saying it’s great for learning. Many say building everything yourself helps you understand computers better, and everyone agrees it’s satisfying to see a real game running on your own engine.

Switching gears, we have an article about designing good APIs. The author says APIs should be simple, familiar, and even a little boring, so they are easy for others to use. The hardest part is not breaking users when you make changes. Versioning, like using /v1/ or /v2/ in URLs, can help, but it adds complexity. Only use it when really needed.

The value of an API depends on the product behind it. If the product is good, people will use a bad API; if the product is bad, even a perfect API cannot help. For authentication, simple long-lived API keys are best for most users, while OAuth is useful but should not be the only option. The author talks about idempotency—making sure repeating an action doesn’t cause problems—and suggests using idempotency keys. Rate limits are important to stop users from overloading the system, and helpful headers can show users their limits. Cursor-based pagination is better for large data than page numbers.

If some fields in a response are expensive to compute, make them optional. The author is not a big fan of GraphQL, but admits it can help in some cases. Internal APIs can be more flexible since you control both sides.

Hacker News users agree that not breaking userspace is critical. Some share stories of API changes causing trouble. There’s discussion about security and business needs forcing complex changes. Many like cursor-based pagination but say it’s hard for newcomers. GraphQL is seen as powerful but complex. Some debate the value of documentation and the role of versioning. There’s also talk about how APIs reflect the systems behind them—messy systems lead to messy APIs. Many agree that good API design is about empathy for the user, and picking simple, familiar formats is best.

In science news, a team of scientists found a very bright and rare fast radio burst, or FRB, in space, and pinpointed its location to within 13 parsecs. FRBs are very short, intense flashes of radio waves from far away. This one was much brighter than usual and close enough to study in detail. Using interferometry—combining data from many antennas—the team found exactly which galaxy and even which part of the galaxy the burst came from.

Knowing the exact spot helps scientists guess what causes FRBs, such as neutron stars or magnetars. This bright FRB is a rare chance to learn more, and it also helps us understand the matter between galaxies, since FRBs travel through all that material.

Hacker News users are excited by this precise result, saying it brings us closer to solving the FRB mystery. Some point out that even with a location, we still don’t know the cause. There’s praise for the technology, questions about why this FRB was so bright, and even a few jokes about aliens. Others say this discovery will inspire more searches for bright or nearby FRBs, and it’s amazing how much we can learn from just radio waves. Some remind everyone that science moves slowly, and each discovery is only one step.

Next up, an article about building card games in Go, with and without AI help. The author describes making his first game, Truco, by hand, which took three months. He learned some React for the UI and used TinyGo to turn Go code into WebAssembly so it could run for free on GitHub Pages. There were many challenges, from making the UI to connecting Go and JavaScript, but the project was finished and is still played online.

A year later, the author built a second game, Escoba, this time using an AI tool called Claude to help. The AI refactored the code for the new game almost perfectly on the first try. The frontend still took a few days, but the process was much faster. The author also shared a step-by-step guide to help others make similar games, including tips on passing data between Go and JavaScript and serving files properly.

Comments show that people are impressed by the speed boost from AI. Some worry about AI replacing jobs, but others like that it lets developers focus on creative work. There’s praise for the clear code examples, and some questions about performance on mobile and for more complex games. Several readers share their own experiences, and most agree that AI is speeding up real projects, but learning the basics is still important.

We also have a story from Montreal, where scientists found that city street trees survive droughts better than park trees because they get water from leaking pipes under the streets. Researchers checked tree rings for lead isotopes and found that street trees used water from old pipes during dry times, while park trees lost water quickly. This means that, although leaks waste water, they help urban trees survive heat and drought.

Hacker News users were surprised by this “unintended benefit” of leaky pipes, though many still think leaks should be fixed. Some noted the need for smarter watering systems, and others wondered if the same effect happens in other cities. There were debates about lead in the water and whether saving trees or water is more important. Many just enjoyed the story, seeing it as another example of nature adapting to city life.

Another popular story is about a website offering a study plan based on the TV show Halt and Catch Fire. The plan is designed for groups who want to watch the show together and discuss the history of technology shown in each episode. The curriculum includes 15 classes, each with videos, real RFCs to read, old computers to try in your browser, and discussion topics. Extra readings are provided for those who want to learn more, and episode summaries are available for busy people. The project is open-source and was made by Ashley Blewer.

In the comments, people praise the show and the idea of using it to teach tech history in a fun, social way. Teachers want to use the syllabus in their classes. Some wish for similar guides for other shows or for doing the course online. Others like the links to real RFCs and old computers. There’s also appreciation for the content warnings, showing care for all users.

Next, we have an update on NASA’s Juno probe at Jupiter. Juno’s mission has lasted much longer than planned and will end in September 2025. Its data has changed our understanding of Jupiter and the solar system. Juno found storms at the poles in strange shapes, a fuzzy mixed-up core, and heavy elements high in the atmosphere. The famous Great Red Spot is much deeper than expected, and new lightning types, like “mushballs,” were discovered. Juno also took close pictures of moons like Ganymede, Europa, and Io, and saw the largest eruption ever on Io.

Juno survived Jupiter’s harsh radiation by flying over the poles and keeping electronics in a titanium vault. The probe’s camera was almost left off, but its beautiful images became famous.

Hacker News users are amazed by the technical skill needed to keep Juno working and the discoveries about Jupiter’s core and storms. Some debate the cost, but most agree the science is worth it. There are discussions about how Juno’s findings will change our view of planet formation, and some users admire the teamwork and creativity behind the mission. Many hope Juno will inspire future missions and young scientists, and while some are sad about losing contact when Juno ends, most see its legacy as lasting for years.

Finally, let’s look at Clearcam, an open-source tool that adds AI object detection, tracking, and alerts to any IP camera or iPhone. Clearcam works with RTSP cameras, and you can run it on your computer with Python or install it using Homebrew on Mac. It uses AI models like YOLOv8 to find people or objects and sends mobile notifications. You can view live feeds, event clips, and everything is encrypted for privacy. There’s an iOS app for easy setup, and Android support is planned. The code runs even on old iPhones, and no extra dependencies are needed for iOS. The project is licensed under AGPL-3.0 and is free to use and change.

Hacker News users like that Clearcam is open-source and self-hosted, giving more privacy and control. Some appreciate the chance to reuse old phones as security cameras. Questions remain about AI detection quality and running on weak hardware. Some users want features like license plate reading, full offline support, and better Android options. There are also concerns about too many or too few alerts, app security, and long-term support. Overall, most agree it’s a useful project, but want more details about performance and privacy.

That’s all for today’s episode. Thank you for listening to Hacker News Daily Podcast. We’ll be back tomorrow with more stories and discussions from the tech world. See you next time!
