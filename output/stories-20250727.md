## Performance and Telemetry Analysis of Trae IDE, ByteDance's VSCode Fork

- 原文链接: [Performance and Telemetry Analysis of Trae IDE, ByteDance's VSCode Fork](https://github.com/segmentationf4u1t/trae_telemetry_research)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44703164)

This article looks at Trae IDE, a code editor made by ByteDance, which is based on Visual Studio Code. The writer tested Trae and found it uses much more memory and sends a lot of data (telemetry) to ByteDance, even when the user tries to turn this off.

Trae IDE started with 33 processes running at once, using about 5.7 GB of memory. This is much higher than regular VSCode (9 processes, 0.9 GB) and another IDE called Cursor. After people complained, Trae’s team made some updates. The latest version uses less memory (about 2.5 GB) and fewer processes (around 13), but it still uses more resources than the others.

The writer also checked Trae’s network activity. They found that Trae still connects to ByteDance servers and sends user data, even when telemetry is turned off in the settings. In fact, turning off telemetry sometimes made Trae send even more data. The data sent includes details about the computer, software, how the user works, and unique numbers that can track users for a long time.

Trae tracks things like how long the app is open, what files are used, and information about your hardware and operating system. It sends this to ByteDance’s servers, which are based in China. The researcher tried to discuss these issues on Trae’s Discord server but got muted for seven days. Later, the words related to “tracking” were even banned automatically, so users could not talk about these problems.

The author says these actions show poor community management and a lack of transparency. Telemetry settings do not really work, and there is no clear information about what data is collected or why. The writer is worried about privacy, as ByteDance could collect detailed profiles of users without their real consent.

Hacker News commenters had strong reactions. Many were concerned about privacy and did not trust the telemetry system, especially because turning it off did nothing. Some felt this kind of behavior is not acceptable for open-source tools and said they would avoid using Trae or any software from ByteDance. Others noted that high resource use makes it hard to use Trae on older computers.

A few commenters said that all big software companies do some data collection, but most agreed that ignoring user settings is a big problem. Some pointed out that open-source forks should be more transparent and listen to user feedback. There was also discussion about whether you can trust any software that comes from companies with a history of privacy issues.

Some people argued that more attention should be paid to the technical side, like why Trae needs so many processes, and whether it brings new features that need extra resources. But most agreed that the main problem is how Trae handles user data and community discussions. In the end, the community seemed to agree that clear privacy controls, respect for user choice, and open discussion are very important for any developer tool.

Dumb Pipe is a tool that lets you connect two computers directly, even if they are behind NATs or have changing network conditions. The main idea is to make a simple, easy way to send data from one device to another without needing accounts or lots of setup.

You install Dumb Pipe with a single command. On one computer, you run it in "listen" mode to get a secret key and connection string. On the second computer, you use that connection string to connect and send data. It works like a Unix pipe, but between different machines anywhere in the world. The tool is just a small wrapper around the Iroh Rust library, which you can use in your own apps if you want. Dumb Pipe uses the QUIC protocol, so connections are fast, encrypted, and allow multiple streams. If a direct connection isn’t possible (about 10–20% of the time), it uses relay nodes to route traffic—this happens automatically. The default relay network is free but has limits; you can pay for faster, authenticated relays. For more features like pubsub, data sync, or big file transfers, you can add extra Iroh tools, but then it’s not just a “dumb” pipe anymore.

In the Hacker News comments, some users liked how simple and direct Dumb Pipe is. They said it’s great for small, quick tasks and for people who don’t want to deal with accounts or complex services. Others compared it to tools like SSH, netcat, or Tailscale, but pointed out that Dumb Pipe is even simpler and doesn’t need any setup or login. Some wondered about security and asked how the secret key is kept safe. A few users worried about relying on third-party relay servers, especially for private data. Others were excited that the project is open source and uses modern tech like QUIC. There were also comments about how this tool could help with remote work, debugging, or just sharing files between friends. Some people pointed out that “dumb pipes” are important building blocks for bigger projects, and tools like this keep things flexible. Overall, most users liked the idea and saw it as a useful addition to the toolbox for network connections.

## I hacked my washing machine

- 原文链接: [I hacked my washing machine](https://nexy.blog/2025/07/27/how-i-hacked-my-washing-machine/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44704270)

This article is about someone hacking their cheap "smart" washing machine to get better notifications and control, because the built-in app was not very good. The writer and their friend, both cybersecurity students, wanted all housemates to get alerts when the washing was done, not just one person at a time as the app allowed.

First, they looked at how their wireless doorbell sent signals to a Discord server and thought they could do the same with the washing machine. They used a special router and software tools to watch how the washing machine talked over the network. The washing machine talked a lot to itself and to a remote server, but the interesting part was it also let the phone app connect directly over HTTP.

They found the washing machine had an encrypted API. The command to read the machine’s status always returned encrypted data. Trying to set encryption off didn’t help. They remembered IoT devices often have weak encryption, like simple XOR, and sometimes reuse the same keys. They tried brute-forcing the key but found a tool online that did this job fast, revealing the key and letting them read the machine’s data.

They figured out which numbers in the data meant which machine settings: things like program, temperature, spin speed, and remaining time. Sometimes the Wi-Fi would go to sleep if not pinged every 30 seconds, so their script had to check often. With the API and decryption working, they wrote a bot that posted washing machine status to Discord, updating when things changed.

Now anyone in the house could see the washing machine state on Discord, solving their original problem. They plan to do the same with other home appliances, using smart plugs or sensors for non-smart devices.

In the comments, many people were impressed by the technical process and the creativity. Some said they liked using Discord for home notifications. Others pointed out privacy risks with smart devices sending data to remote servers, and were glad the author kept things local. A few worried about hacking appliances in a rental house, saying it could break the machine or upset the landlord. Some shared their own stories of hacking other “smart” home gadgets, often finding simple or bad security.

There were comments about the weak encryption; some said XOR with a fixed key is very bad security for an internet-connected device. Others wondered if this kind of hacking could void the warranty or get someone in trouble. A few people asked for more details on how the Discord bot was made, and liked that the author shared their code. Finally, some people joked about the “smart home arms race” and how soon everything in the house will be talking to Discord.

## The Bootstrap Load

- 原文链接: [The Bootstrap Load](http://www.intel4004.com/btstrp.htm)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44704482)

This article explains how an engineer named Faggin used a special trick called “bootstrap load” to make better computer chips at Fairchild in 1970. He worked with new silicon gate technology to help microchips run faster and use less power.

In regular chips, logic gates used “resistive loads,” which meant the output voltage only reached about 60% of the power given to the chip. With the bootstrap load circuit, Faggin made logic gates that could reach the full supply voltage. This was important because it made the chips work faster and more reliably.

To do this, Faggin had to make good capacitors on the chip, which many people thought was impossible without extra steps. But Faggin, who understood the physics well, found a way to do it without needing any extra layers during the chip-making process. He talked about needing a “virtual junction” instead of a real one, which was a clever idea at the time.

The bootstrap load and another trick called “buried contact” were both very important for making microchips that were fast and didn’t use too much power. Other companies, like Rockwell, tried different ways to get similar results, but their designs were more difficult and took longer. For example, Rockwell’s PPS-4 chip came out nine months after Intel’s 4004, which used Faggin’s better method.

The article also shows old diagrams of the 4004 chip, with pencil notes from Faggin. These notes show where bootstrap loads were used on the chip. In the schematics, a resistor symbol means a MOS transistor acting as a resistive load. If there’s a “B” next to it, that means a bootstrap load was used there.

Hacker News users found the technical details interesting. Some said bootstrap load was a smart solution that helped early computers work better. Others talked about how tricky it was to make capacitors on chips back then, and they were impressed by Faggin’s creative thinking.

A few commenters compared this method to the more complex four-phase design used by other companies, and they agreed Faggin’s bootstrap load was simpler and more effective. Some users who worked with old chips or studied chip history shared their own stories about similar challenges.

One person pointed out that these small technical choices made a big difference in how fast computers improved. Another user noted that Faggin’s background in physics helped him see solutions others missed. There was also discussion about how important it is to understand the basics of how devices work, not just how to follow standard designs.

Some people wondered if these tricks are still useful today, or if modern chips use different methods. A few users said that today’s chip design is very different, but the spirit of finding clever solutions is still important. Overall, commenters appreciated learning the history and seeing how small ideas can change technology.

## Return of wolves to Yellowstone has led to a surge in aspen trees

- 原文链接: [Return of wolves to Yellowstone has led to a surge in aspen trees](https://www.livescience.com/animals/land-mammals/return-of-wolves-to-yellowstone-has-led-to-a-surge-in-aspen-trees-unseen-for-80-years)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44658323)

Wolves were brought back to Yellowstone National Park after being gone for many years. The article says that since wolves returned, the number of aspen trees in the park has gone up a lot.

When wolves were not in Yellowstone, elk were able to eat aspen tree shoots without fear. This stopped young aspen trees from growing. After wolves came back, they started hunting elk. Because elk had to be more careful, they did not eat aspen shoots as much. This gave the trees a chance to grow taller and stronger. Scientists watched these changes for many years. They saw that aspen trees were growing in places where elk used to eat them all. The article says this is a good example of how one animal can change the whole environment. Wolves changed the behavior of elk, which helped the trees. The return of wolves also helped other animals, like beavers and birds, because they use aspen trees. This is called a “trophic cascade”—one change at the top affects many things below. The article also says it took more than ten years to see these big changes. Nature sometimes needs a lot of time to heal and grow.

In the comments, some people are happy about the return of wolves and the aspen trees. They say this shows why it is good to protect wild animals. Others point out that the story is more complex. Some say the number of elk was already going down before wolves returned, because of hunting and weather. A few people think other things also helped the trees, not just wolves. Some commenters warn that we should not expect quick fixes in nature. Others ask if the same thing could work in other places. One person worries about how local people feel about wolves. Another says it is good to see science used to guide decisions. Some are surprised at how much one change can affect everything else. A few people share stories from other parks and countries. In general, most agree this is an interesting example of nature working in balance.

## GPT might be an information virus (2023)

- 原文链接: [GPT might be an information virus (2023)](https://nonint.com/2023/03/09/gpt-might-be-an-information-virus/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44704377)

This article talks about how AI tools like GPT can quickly create lots of fake or low-quality content on the internet. The author says this could make it very hard to find good, real information online in the next few years.

The article explains that many people are now using AI to write websites, social media posts, and product reviews. In the past, this work was often done by people in content farms, but AI does the job faster, cheaper, and better. Because of this, the amount of fake or repeated content will grow much more quickly than before. As AI fills the internet with so much content, it will be harder for people to find or trust real, useful information. Over time, real people may stop writing and sharing online because their voices get lost in all the AI noise. The author calls this problem an “information virus,” saying it spreads because there is money to be made from creating content.

The article also says that search engines like Google could be in trouble. Google’s search works because it helps people find good answers, but if too much of the web is filled with AI-made content that looks real but might be wrong, Google can’t easily tell the difference. This means search results will get worse, and people might stop using Google. The author thinks Google knows about this risk but does not believe Google will disappear—just that it will need to change a lot.

The writer wonders if this change could finally make the idea of “web 3.0” (a new, decentralized web) happen because people might want new ways to share and find information that is not so easily flooded by AI. They also point out that the internet has already been getting less useful for some time, so maybe it is good to move on to something better.

In the comments, some readers strongly agree that AI-generated content will make it much harder to trust or find good information online. Others say that this is just another step in a long process—the internet has always had spam and low-quality content, and people will find new ways to filter or avoid it. Some think that better tools or smarter search engines will appear to help us deal with the flood of AI content.

A few commenters worry that if real people stop sharing their ideas online, we will lose important personal stories and creative work. Others are hopeful, saying that new communities or platforms could appear, where humans can still talk to each other and share real things. Some suggest that smaller, private spaces online—like forums or invite-only groups—will become more important.

There are comments that point out Google’s business model depends on trust, and if that trust is lost, it could be a huge problem. A few people suggest that AI might also be used to spot fake or repeated content, making the problem less serious. Some readers think the author is too negative and that having fast, cheap ways to learn and get answers is very helpful, even if it has some risks. Overall, the discussion shows both worry and excitement about how AI might change the way we use the web.

Tom Lehrer, a famous songwriter and mathematician, has died at age 97. He was best known for his funny and dark songs in the 1950s and 1960s. Lehrer wrote songs with clever and sometimes rude words, but the music was cheerful and catchy. He performed on piano in clubs, concerts, and sold many records by mail. Some of his most popular songs were “The Vatican Rag” and “Poisoning Pigeons in the Park.” Even though people loved his music, Lehrer preferred his job as a teacher and mathematician. He worked at Harvard, MIT, and other universities. He stopped performing after only a few years and never tried to be a big star. Lehrer once said he liked people buying his records, but he didn’t need applause from crowds. His songs were few, but they were very memorable and unique. Lehrer’s music joked about serious topics in a playful way.

In the comments, many people shared memories of hearing Lehrer’s songs as children or in college. Some said his music helped them see that smart humor could be fun. Others pointed out that Lehrer’s work still feels fresh and bold today. A few mentioned that Lehrer influenced many comedians and songwriters after him. Some people admired his choice to leave fame behind and focus on teaching. Others wished he had written more songs or performed longer. There was talk about how his songs are still shared online and make new fans. A few commenters discussed how his mix of math and music was special. Some said Lehrer’s humor helped them understand tough topics more easily. Others simply thanked him for making them laugh for so many years. Many agreed that Lehrer was a rare and clever artist who will be missed.

## IBM Keyboard Patents

- 原文链接: [IBM Keyboard Patents](https://sharktastica.co.uk/topics/patents)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44704422)

This article lists and explains many IBM keyboard patents, covering designs and technologies from 1901 to the 1990s. It shows how IBM and related companies shaped keyboards, typewriters, and keypunch machines over time through inventions and design changes.

The article starts with early patents like the Hollerith keypunch, which helped automate data entry. IBM’s patents include both utility (how things work) and design (how things look). Some important examples are patents for the “golfball” typewriter head (used in Selectric machines), the buckling spring switch (famous for its feel and sound), and the membrane buckling spring (which made keyboards cheaper to build).

There are also patents for special keyboards, like ones with split layouts for better ergonomics, and for key stabilizers so big keys do not wobble. IBM’s patents cover keyboards for many uses—personal computers, cash registers, bank terminals, and even point-of-sale machines in stores. Some patents are for protecting keyboards from spills and vandalism, showing IBM thought about real-world problems.

The article includes designs for famous IBM keyboards such as Model F and Model M, both loved by many typists and programmers today. It also lists patents from other companies, like Alps and AT&T, who made their own improvements, sometimes using IBM ideas.

In the comments, some people are amazed by the number of patents and the history. They talk about how IBM’s focus on quality led to better keyboards and how some of these designs are still used or copied today. Others say it is sad that most new keyboards do not feel as good as old IBM ones. Some discuss patent laws, saying patents helped IBM stay ahead, but also made it hard for others to innovate.

A few users share stories about using IBM keyboards at work, calling them “indestructible” and fun to type on. Others mention that some features, like the buckling spring, are still popular in custom keyboards. There are also comments about how patents for ergonomic keyboards were ahead of their time, and that today’s split and curved keyboards owe a lot to IBM’s early ideas.

Some people point out that while patents protect inventions, they can also slow down progress. There is debate about whether patents should last so long, or if sharing ideas would help everyone more. A few users note that IBM’s keyboard designs influenced not just computers, but many other devices.

Overall, readers agree that IBM’s keyboard patents changed typing and computers. The old designs still inspire keyboard fans, and many wish modern keyboards were made as well as those from the IBM era.

## The JJ VCS workshop: A zero-to-hero speedrun

- 原文链接: [The JJ VCS workshop: A zero-to-hero speedrun](https://github.com/jkoppel/jj-workshop)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44700815)

This article is about a workshop that teaches people how to use JJ, a new version control system, from beginner level to advanced. The writer explains how JJ works and how it is different from Git, the most popular version control tool.

JJ is made to be fast and easy to use. It uses a different design than Git, which helps avoid some common problems. For example, JJ lets you change your commit history in simple ways, even after you share your code. It can do this because it stores data in a new way and uses an operation called "rebasing" all the time. In JJ, you can fix mistakes and organize your code history without getting stuck or confused. The commands are similar to Git, but some have different names, and some are simpler. The workshop gives step-by-step tasks, like making changes, undoing them, and sharing them with others.

The article also talks about JJ’s strong points, like how it makes code review easier, and how its commands are safer because they do not lose data by accident. There are examples that show how JJ can make daily work faster and less stressful, especially when you need to fix mistakes or work with other people. The writer shows how JJ’s user interface helps you see your project’s history more clearly. The workshop is meant for people who already know Git but want to try something new.

People in the comment section have many opinions. Some are excited about JJ and like its fresh ideas. They say JJ could fix problems that have bothered them in Git for years. Others are not sure if it will become popular, since Git is already everywhere. Some worry about learning new commands and changing their habits. A few say JJ’s way of changing history could be dangerous if not used carefully. Some are happy the workshop is easy to follow and want to try JJ right away. Others think that even if JJ is better, it is hard to switch tools in big companies. Some ask about how JJ works with old Git projects. Others say it is good to have choices and hope new ideas from JJ will help all version control tools get better.
