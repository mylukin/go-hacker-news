## Leaving Google has actively improved my life

- 原文链接: [Leaving Google has actively improved my life](https://pseudosingleton.com/leaving-google-improved-my-life/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47184288)

This article is about someone who left Google’s services, like Gmail and Search, and found life got better. The writer was unhappy with Google adding more AI and ads, and wanted more control and privacy.

First, they switched from Gmail to another email service called Proton. They realized Gmail’s features—like sorting emails with algorithms—were not helpful and even made things worse. Now, with Proton, their inbox is much cleaner, and they are more careful about who gets their email address. They say there are many good alternatives to Gmail, such as Fastmail and Tuta.

For searching the web, the writer stopped using Google. Instead, they use Brave and DuckDuckGo and think these search engines work better for most things. Searching is now more fun because they visit different sites directly, not just Google. They feel like they are “surfing the web” again, like in the old days.

The author also feels better about supporting fewer big tech companies. They know it probably won’t change the world, but it feels good to avoid Google. They think most people use Google just because it’s the default, not by choice. Google pays a lot of money to stay the default on phones and browsers, making it hard for people to switch.

The article points out that “free” services are not really free—users pay with their data and privacy. The writer says paying for better services is worth it, but notes that many alternatives also have free versions. They mention it can feel strange to leave big tech, but most people they talk to are not happy with Google either.

The only Google service they still use is YouTube. They find it hard to quit because no other platform has as many creators. But they are hopeful because new video platforms are starting to grow.

Looking at the top Hacker News comments, many people agree that Google’s products have gotten worse, especially search and Gmail. Some say they also switched to Proton or Fastmail and are happier. Others like using DuckDuckGo or Kagi for searching. A few people think Google Search is still useful for some things, like local maps or very specific questions.

Some commenters point out that leaving Google is harder if your friends or work use Google services. Others say using Google is just a habit, and most people don’t know about good alternatives. A few warn that other big tech companies, like Apple or Microsoft, also have problems with privacy and control.

Many agree that paying for good services is smarter than using “free” ones filled with ads. Some are hopeful that more people will try different tools if they see stories like this. Overall, most say that it’s possible to quit Google, but it takes some effort and learning new habits.

## OpenAI raises $110B on $730B pre-money valuation

- 原文链接: [OpenAI raises $110B on $730B pre-money valuation](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/27/openai-raises-110b-in-one-of-the-largest-private-funding-rounds-in-history/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47181211)

OpenAI just raised $110 billion, and now the company is valued at $730 billion before the new money. This is a huge amount of money for an AI company, and it shows how much people believe in OpenAI and its technology.

The article explains that OpenAI is famous for making ChatGPT and other AI tools. Many big investors want to be part of the company because they think AI will change the world. With this big investment, OpenAI can hire more people, buy more computers, and make better AI models. The article says OpenAI’s new value is close to some of the largest tech companies, even though it is much younger. OpenAI will use this money to research new AI methods and maybe make products for businesses and regular people. Some people worry that so much money can make a company focus on profit and forget its mission. Others think OpenAI will now compete even harder with Google, Microsoft, and other AI companies. The article also mentions that OpenAI has both a nonprofit and a for-profit part, and this can sometimes cause problems inside the company.

In the comments, some people are shocked at how high the valuation is. They think it is too much for a company that is not very old. Others believe that AI is the future, so the price makes sense. Some users worry that with so much money, OpenAI could lose its focus on safety. A few people say that big investments like this usually mean there will be more pressure to make money quickly. Some commenters compare this to tech bubbles from the past, like the dot-com boom. Others point out that this gives OpenAI a lot of power in the AI world, which could be risky. A few think it will be hard for small startups to compete now. Many agree that this will push other companies to invest more in AI too. Some hope OpenAI will use the money for good, but others are not sure. A couple of commenters are excited to see what new AI tools OpenAI will release next.

## The Robotic Dexterity Deadlock

- 原文链接: [The Robotic Dexterity Deadlock](https://www.origami-robotics.com/blog/dexterity-deadlocks.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47184744)

The article talks about a problem with robotic dexterity and why it is hard for robots to do tasks with their hands like humans do. It explains that even though robots are good at repeating simple actions, they struggle with tasks that need many small, careful moves, such as folding clothes or handling soft objects. The main reason is that robots need to sense and react to the world in real time, but it’s very hard for them to understand touch and adjust quickly if something goes wrong.

The article says that teaching a robot to do something by showing it once does not work for complex hand tasks. Each object can be a different shape or size, so robots have to learn many ways to handle them. Also, robots need good fingers and sensors, but building these is expensive and tricky. Sometimes, software can help, but it is not enough by itself; hardware must improve too.

The article shares that companies and researchers have made progress, but real-world use is still slow. People expect robots to work like humans, but this is not possible yet. The article gives examples like picking up laundry, cooking, or stacking odd-shaped boxes—these are easy for people but very hard for robots. The “deadlock” means robots get stuck: they cannot get better without more data, but it’s hard to get data because the robots do not work well yet.

In the Hacker News comments, some people agree and say robotic hands are still too slow and clumsy for most jobs. Others point out that robots are good at simple tasks, like moving boxes or sorting big objects, but not at fine detail work. A few commenters think we should focus on making robots do new things that humans cannot, instead of trying to copy the human hand. Some are hopeful that better AI and cheaper sensors will help robots improve soon.

There are also comments about the cost of building robot hands—many say it’s too expensive for most businesses. Some users share examples from their own work, saying robots often break or get confused when things change. Others talk about how people are still much faster and more flexible than machines. But a few are optimistic, saying that slow progress is normal in hard problems, and that robotics is getting better over time.

Some comments warn that we may never get robots to be as good as humans at hand tasks. Others remember past tech that seemed impossible but later worked out. Many agree that mixing software and hardware advances is the way forward. The conversation shows both frustration with the slow pace and excitement for the future.

## A better streams API is possible for JavaScript

- 原文链接: [A better streams API is possible for JavaScript](https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-better-web-streams-api/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47180569)

The article talks about problems with the current JavaScript Streams API, called Web Streams, and shows a new, simpler idea for handling streams in JavaScript. The writer has worked with streams in Node.js, Cloudflare Workers, Deno, Bun, and browsers, and says the standard API is too complex, slow, and hard to use.

The article explains that Web Streams were made before JavaScript had async iteration, so the API uses special readers, locks, and controllers. This makes common things, like reading data, much harder than needed. Even with modern language features, the API still has hidden complexity. The writer shows that small mistakes, like forgetting to release a lock, can break streams and cause hard-to-find bugs. Features like BYOB (bring your own buffer) are very complex, rarely used, and only help a little with performance.

The article points out that backpressure, which is supposed to prevent too much data from building up, does not really work in practice. The API expects developers to follow special rules, but nothing stops them from ignoring these rules, leading to memory problems or slow apps. The design also creates many promises, even when they are not needed, making streams much slower—sometimes up to 100 times slower than simpler designs.

Real-world problems are shown, like leaked connections when streams are not fully read, memory issues when using tee() to split streams, and performance drops during server-side rendering because of too many small promise allocations. The article says that every major runtime has had to make custom changes or shortcuts to try to fix these issues, but this leads to more confusion and code that works differently across platforms. The test suite for streams is huge, showing just how many edge cases and bugs exist because of the complex design.

The writer proposes a new streams API, built around JavaScript’s async iterables. It removes the need for special classes, locks, or controllers. Instead, streams are just sequences of chunks you can loop over with for-await-of. Transforms are pull-based, so data only moves when a consumer asks for it, and backpressure is strict and simple. The new design allows for batching data, uses only bytes (Uint8Array), and has both sync and async versions for better performance. Benchmarks show this new API can be 2 to 120 times faster than Web Streams.

In the Hacker News comments, many users agree that the current Web Streams API is hard to use and has too much boilerplate. Some say they often make mistakes with locks or get confused by BYOB reads. Others note that most developers just want to read data simply, and the API should not make the easy case hard. A few point out that the Web Streams design made sense years ago, but JavaScript has changed, and now we should use async iterators as the base for streams.

Some commenters defend the old API, saying it was needed for browser security and cross-platform support. They warn that making things too simple might ignore important edge cases or security needs. Others share their own workarounds or custom libraries, showing that many people have tried to fix these issues in their own code. A few users ask about migration paths and worry about breaking old code if a new API is adopted. Some are excited about the new proposal and want to try the sample code, while others are cautious, saying that standards move slowly and it will take time for any big change to happen. Overall, most agree that streams are important, but the API should match how developers actually write JavaScript today.

## NASA announces overhaul of Artemis program amid safety concerns, delays

- 原文链接: [NASA announces overhaul of Artemis program amid safety concerns, delays](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nasa-artemis-moon-program-overhaul/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47182483)

NASA is changing its Artemis program because there are safety problems and things are taking longer than planned. The Artemis program is NASA’s big project to send people back to the Moon and later to Mars.

NASA found some issues with the rockets and spaceships, especially the Space Launch System (SLS) and the Orion capsule. These problems could make trips unsafe or cause accidents. Some parts are not working as expected, and testing is taking more time. NASA is now checking everything again. They want to be sure astronauts are safe. Because of these changes, the next Artemis mission will be delayed. NASA will fix the technical problems before sending people. They are also looking at how money is being spent and how to improve teamwork with private companies.

Some top comments on Hacker News say NASA is doing the right thing by focusing on safety, even if it means waiting. Many users compare NASA’s slow process to private companies like SpaceX, which move faster but sometimes take more risks. Some people are sad about the delays because they want to see humans on the Moon again soon. Others say it’s good to take time, because a crash or accident would be much worse. A few commenters talk about NASA’s large budget and how money could be used better. Some users think there is too much paperwork and not enough action. Others remember past NASA missions and say this kind of delay is normal. A few people hope private companies can help speed things up. Overall, the comments show both support and frustration with NASA’s careful approach.

## Let's discuss sandbox isolation

- 原文链接: [Let's discuss sandbox isolation](https://www.shayon.dev/post/2026/52/lets-discuss-sandbox-isolation/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47184049)

The article talks about running untrusted code safely using sandbox isolation. It explains how different technologies like Docker, gVisor, microVMs, and WebAssembly each provide their own way of isolating code to protect the host system.

The author says words like "isolation" are used a lot, but not all isolation is the same. For example, Docker containers use Linux namespaces to hide things, but all containers still share the same Linux kernel. If there’s a bug in the kernel, all containers are at risk. Cgroups help limit resources but do not provide true security. Seccomp can block dangerous system calls, but allowed calls still reach the kernel. gVisor uses a user-space kernel called Sentry, which catches most system calls before they touch the host, making attacks harder. MicroVMs, like Firecracker, use hardware virtualization so each workload gets its own tiny virtual machine and kernel, giving very strong isolation. WebAssembly (WASM) is different—it does not allow system calls at all; code can only do what the host lets it, making it very safe for some uses.

The article says each approach has trade-offs. Namespaces and cgroups are fast but weak, while microVMs are slow but strong. gVisor and WASM are in the middle. The right choice depends on what you need: running trusted code for yourself, or running untrusted code from someone else. The author warns that using Docker does not mean you are fully safe if the code is untrusted.

The article also talks about local sandboxing for AI agents running on your own computer. Here, tools like Cursor and Codex CLI use the operating system’s own controls to block reading sensitive files or making network requests. Apple’s new Containerization framework gives each local container its own lightweight VM, making things safer than Docker on Mac.

In the Hacker News comments, many people agree with the main points. Some say most developers wrongly believe Docker gives strong security when it only hides things, not protects them. Others point out that bugs in the Linux kernel can break all isolation if you use only namespaces or cgroups. Some think gVisor is a good middle ground, but note its extra overhead and that it is not perfect—bugs in gVisor itself could still cause problems. Users like microVMs for their strong hardware isolation, but mention they are slower and use more memory.

There is discussion about WebAssembly being great for safety and speed, but not ready for all languages or workloads yet. Several users mention how important network controls are—code in a strong sandbox can still leak secrets if it has open network access. Some people share real-world stories: for example, production outages caused by letting containers have too many privileges, or security incidents due to bad defaults in Docker.

A few commenters talk about the new Apple framework, saying it is a big step forward for running safe, local development environments on Macs. Others point out that securing the network and file access is just as important as isolating the process itself.

Some users warn that adding layers like gVisor or microVMs can make debugging harder and slow things down. But most agree that if you run untrusted code, you must trade off speed for safety. Finally, there is excitement about new projects and better tools for isolation, and a shared feeling that this is an area to watch as more AI agents and cloud platforms run user code.

- 原文链接: [Dan Simmons, author of Hyperion, has died](https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/longmont-co/daniel-simmons-12758871)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47183578)

Dan Simmons, the author of the famous science fiction book "Hyperion," has died. He was born in Illinois in 1948, loved reading and storytelling from a young age, and first worked as a schoolteacher for many years.

As a teacher, Dan made his classes exciting by using stories, science shows, and creative activities. He even created a long story for his students, which later became the "Hyperion" series. His first novel, "Song of Kali," won a big award. In 1987, Dan left teaching to become a full-time writer.

Dan wrote over thirty books in many styles—science fiction, horror, crime, and historical fiction. His books won many awards, including the Hugo, and were translated into many languages. The book "The Terror" was made into a TV show. Dan was known for not following normal rules about what kind of books to write; he just wrote about what he loved.

He also enjoyed teaching others, sharing movies with friends and family, and was loved by his students, family, and readers. He is survived by his wife, daughter, grandchildren, and brother.

In the Hacker News comments, many people shared how much Dan Simmons’ books meant to them. Some said "Hyperion" was their favorite science fiction story ever. Others remembered reading his books as teenagers and being amazed by the new ideas. A few commenters liked that Simmons was not afraid to mix different genres and write original stories. Some talked about his teaching career and how it shaped his writing. One person said they were inspired to become a writer after reading his work. Others shared that "The Terror" TV show was how they first learned about him, and then went on to read his books. A few people discussed his different writing styles, saying that some books were very different from others, but all showed his love of storytelling. Some pointed out that his books are not always easy to read, but worth the effort. A few commenters shared personal stories of meeting him at book events and said he was kind in person. Many expressed sadness at his passing, and thanks for the stories he gave to the world.

## A new California law says all operating systems need to have age verification

- 原文链接: [A new California law says all operating systems need to have age verification](https://www.pcgamer.com/software/operating-systems/a-new-california-law-says-all-operating-systems-including-linux-need-to-have-some-form-of-age-verification-at-account-setup/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47181208)

A new law in California says every operating system must check the age of users. This is part of a plan to protect kids online.

The article explains that companies like Apple, Google, and Microsoft will need to add some kind of age check when someone sets up a computer or phone. The law is not just for websites or apps, but for the whole operating system. If a company does not follow this rule, they could get a big fine. The goal is to stop kids from seeing things online that are not safe for them. The law also wants to make it harder for companies to collect data from children. It says companies must give parents more control over what their kids can do online. Tech companies are worried because it is hard to know the real age of users. They also say it could make things harder for everyone, not just kids. Some people think the law will make it more difficult to use devices and could lead to privacy problems if companies start asking for IDs or more personal data. The law will start soon, so companies have to make changes fast.

In the comments, many people think this law is a bad idea. Some say it will not really protect kids, but just annoy adults who have to prove their age. Others worry about privacy, because it could mean showing your ID or sharing more personal information with big companies. A few people point out that kids will find ways to get around the system anyway. Some commenters agree that the internet is dangerous for kids, but they think this law is not the right answer. Others say it could hurt small companies and open source projects, because they might not have the money or time to add these checks. There are also worries that this kind of law could spread to other states or countries. A few people support the idea, saying it is good for parents to have more control. But most comments are critical and think the law will cause more problems than it solves.

## Writing a Guide to SDF Fonts

- 原文链接: [Writing a Guide to SDF Fonts](https://www.redblobgames.com/blog/2026-02-26-writing-a-guide-to-sdf-fonts/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47183725)

This article is about the author’s journey writing a guide to SDF (signed distance field) fonts, which are used to make fonts look good with effects like outlines and shadows. The author first learned about SDF fonts in 2024 while working on games and a map generator, but didn’t fully understand all the details, so they wrote down notes and paused the project.

Later, the author noticed their unfinished notes were ranking high in search results for “sdf fonts,” even though the notes were not very good. Instead of being upset, the author decided to write a better, more helpful page. They reviewed their old notes, which included an overview page and many diary-style entries about trying different SDF font libraries like msdfgen and stb_truetype, with code, diagrams, and screenshots.

The author realized the topic was too big, so they narrowed the focus to just one library, msdfgen, and explored its tradeoffs, such as atlas size and smoothing. They made diagrams and ran tests to compare settings, but noticed they could spend forever testing. To avoid this, they shifted to a “how to” guide with step-by-step instructions and JavaScript code for CPU and GPU rendering.

After more work, they felt the new version had too much code and not enough clear concepts, so they started over again, creating a page focused on the main ideas: what SDF does, how it works, and how to use it for different effects. They removed extra technical details, moved some content elsewhere, and decided not to make a downloadable project. Finally, after many changes and a year of effort, the author is happy with the new guide and hopes it will help others.

In the comments, some people praise the author's honesty about the messy process and like seeing how the guide changed over time. Others mention they found the original notes helpful, even if they were incomplete, and appreciate having real-world examples of using SDF fonts. A few readers discuss the technical parts, like the choice of libraries and the challenges of picking the right atlas size or smoothing settings. Some wish the guide covered more libraries, while others agree it’s better to focus on one to keep things clear. There are questions about making SDF fonts work smoothly on different devices, and some people share their own tips for rendering text with effects. Overall, readers seem glad the author shared both successes and struggles, making the topic easier to understand for others.

## Show HN: Claude-File-Recovery, recover files from your ~/.claude sessions

- 原文链接: [Show HN: Claude-File-Recovery, recover files from your ~/.claude sessions](https://github.com/hjtenklooster/claude-file-recovery)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47182387)

This tool helps you recover files made or changed by Claude Code, even if you lost them or forgot where they are. It looks at the logs Claude keeps in your computer, finds all the steps where files were written or edited, and lets you bring those files back.

The tool scans all session logs saved as JSONL files under the “~/.claude/projects/” folder. It reads these logs very quickly, ignoring lines it does not need. Then, it links each action (like writing or editing a file) with the result, using special IDs. After that, it puts all the actions in order for each file, so you can see how the file changed over time. You can use a simple text interface (TUI) to browse, search, and recover files. The TUI has helpful features like fuzzy search, colored differences between file versions, batch file extraction, and useful keyboard shortcuts (like “j/k” for up/down, “/” to search, “Enter” to see details, and “q” to quit). You can also recover files as they were at any time in the past, not just the latest version.

Some people in the comments think this tool is very useful, especially for those who use Claude Code a lot and sometimes lose track of their files. They like that it is fast, supports point-in-time recovery, and can search and export many files at once. Others say they did not know Claude kept such detailed logs on disk, and they wonder about privacy and disk space. A few suggest that similar tools should exist for other AI coding assistants like Copilot or ChatGPT. Some users ask if this tool could also show deleted files or undo mistakes more easily. There are also comments about the technical choices—some praise using “orjson” for speed and the smart way the tool skips unnecessary lines. A few wish the install process was even simpler, or that there was a web interface. Overall, most agree it solves a real problem in a smart way and are happy it is open source.
