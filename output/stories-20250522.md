- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44057820)

Gemini Diffusion is Google's new language model that uses diffusion instead of transformers to generate text. Traditional models create text one word at a time, but Gemini Diffusion refines noise to quickly generate coherent text, making it much faster. The article talks about how the model responded super fast in a test, producing an interactive HTML+JavaScript page in seconds. Although there are no independent benchmarks yet, Google claims it's five times faster than their previous models.

In the comments, one user clarifies that diffusion doesn't replace transformers but autoregression, meaning the whole input is processed at once. Another user explains how diffusion models are like BERT, where you replace parts of a sentence with a mask and predict the missing words. Some people are excited about the speed and potential of diffusion models, saying they could change how we code. Others express skepticism, noting that while models are fast, they might not handle large, complex codebases well. There are also discussions about how the models can be improved, with suggestions to integrate reasoning techniques and better handle large amounts of data. Overall, the response to Gemini Diffusion is a mix of excitement about its speed and curiosity about its future applications.

The article talks about an exciting project called ITXPlus. It's a reproduction of the Macintosh Plus logic board, but in a Mini-ITX size. This new board doesn't need any original parts, making it perfect for modern builds. It includes features like VGA output, a standard ATX power supply connector, and 4MB of RAM. The board uses some clever replacements for older components, like a custom sound IC and a real-time clock replacement. It doesn’t support floppy drives but has connections for those who want to add them. Most parts are surface-mounted, but some larger parts are not. The goal is to make it open-source, so anyone can build it.

In the comments, people are excited about this project. They see it as a great way to keep retrocomputing alive, especially since original parts are hard to find. Some discuss how earlier Macs, like the SE/30, are harder to recreate due to complex chips. Others suggest that making new Mac models might be easier. There's also a discussion about how newer designs are harder to replicate because they are more complex. Several commenters appreciate the idea of combining old and new technologies to preserve these classic computers. Some even dream of building more powerful versions using similar methods. Overall, the community is thrilled and sees a bright future for retro tech projects like this one.

## CERN gears up to ship antimatter across Europe

- 原文链接: [CERN gears up to ship antimatter across Europe](https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/cern-gears-up-to-ship-antimatter-across-europe/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44033711)

CERN is making plans to transport antimatter across Europe in a special container. Antimatter is tricky because it vanishes quickly when it meets regular matter, and CERN has found a way to trap it for study. But the equipment used to slow down and trap antimatter also messes with the measurements, so they want to move the antimatter to other places where it can be studied more precisely.

The container CERN built is about two meters long and uses superconducting materials to keep antimatter from touching the walls. It needs a lot of power and liquid helium to stay cold. They tested it by putting regular protons inside and driving it around the CERN campus in a truck. This showed that the container keeps everything cold and stable, even though liquid helium levels dropped during the drive. They plan to send antimatter to a new lab in Düsseldorf, Germany, which could greatly improve the precision of experiments.

In the comments section, people are excited about the technology and its potential. Some users are amazed at the advanced methods needed to make even tiny amounts of antimatter. Others discuss technical challenges like the liquid helium needed for cooling. Some commenters joke about the idea of antimatter being used in sci-fi scenarios or as a weapon, while others highlight the scientific value of understanding antimatter's properties better. There’s also a mix of serious and light-hearted takes on how this innovation could affect future research and technology.

## Gemini figured out my nephew’s name

- 原文链接: [Gemini figured out my nephew’s name](https://blog.nawaz.org/posts/2025/May/gemini-figured-out-my-nephews-name/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44025459)

The article talks about using an AI tool called Gemini to find the name of the author's nephew from a pile of emails. The author built a special server to let the AI search through emails without changing them. The AI, Gemini, was tasked to find the nephew's name by looking through emails from a person named Donovan. Although the AI made a lot of searches and found many unrelated results, it finally guessed the name "Monty" after linking it with a subject line and email content.

In the comments, many readers had mixed feelings. Some thought the AI's process was not very impressive, saying it was just fancy search work that a human could do. They pointed out that the AI made a lucky guess, rather than a definitive finding. Others found it interesting that the AI could infer Monty's identity by connecting small clues. There was also a discussion about privacy, with some users concerned about letting AI access personal emails and the risks of sharing data with third-party services. Privacy worries were a big theme, as people debated how much information AI could gather from our digital footprints. Some users also joked about how AI might get things wrong, like guessing that Monty was a cat because cats can't read. Overall, the comments showed a mix of amazement and skepticism about AI's capabilities and their implications for privacy.

## Getting a paper accepted

- 原文链接: [Getting a paper accepted](https://maxwellforbes.com/posts/how-to-get-a-paper-accepted/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44057841)

The article by Maxwell Forbes talks about how to get a research paper accepted at conferences. It shares tips on improving a paper’s chances by focusing on key elements like the title, abstract, and first page to make a strong first impression.

Forbes explains that the first page is crucial, as many reviewers decide whether to accept or reject a paper based on it. He suggests using a clear, specific, and memorable title, an eye-catching Figure 1, and a well-crafted abstract that quickly shows the paper’s value. The rest of the paper should avoid reasons for rejection by being complete and clear. Forbes also advises readers to think about reasons a reviewer might reject the paper and then avoid those pitfalls. The article emphasizes that these changes not only help in getting a paper accepted but also improve the quality of the science itself.

In the comments, people share different views on the academic publishing process. Some agree that academia often feels more like a game of prestige and career-building than pure science. Others argue that private sector work might offer more freedom and better communication of results. Some commenters note that branding and marketing are important in all fields, not just in machine learning, and that clear communication is key to making research impactful. A few people express concern that the focus on branding might detract from the actual scientific discoveries, while others feel that making a paper engaging and easy to read is a valuable skill. The discussion reflects a mix of skepticism and support for the strategies Forbes suggests, showing the complex views around academic publishing.
