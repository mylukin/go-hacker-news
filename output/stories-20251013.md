## NanoChat – The best ChatGPT that $100 can buy

- 原文链接: [NanoChat – The best ChatGPT that $100 can buy](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45569350)

NanoChat is a project that shows how to build a ChatGPT-like chatbot for about $100. The code is simple, easy to change, and can run on a single powerful GPU server.

The main idea is to give people a full, end-to-end large language model (LLM) that is not too hard to understand or use. You can train, fine-tune, test, and chat with your own model—all from one place. The speedrun script helps you set up, train, and test the model in around four hours, if you rent a server with eight H100 GPUs (which costs about $24 per hour). After training, you get a basic chatbot that you can use in your web browser, similar to ChatGPT.

NanoChat is not as smart as the real ChatGPT. It’s more like talking to a small child—the model can answer questions, write poems, and sometimes make things up. The training data and model size are much smaller because of the cost limit. There are results and scores in a report file, showing how well the model does on different tasks. If you want a bigger, better model, you can spend more money and time, but the guide focuses on the $100 version for now.

The code can be used on different GPU types. If you only have one GPU, it still works, but training will take longer. If your GPU does not have enough memory, you need to change some settings to make it fit. The project keeps things simple—no big, complex setups or extra tools. You can also package the whole codebase to ask questions about it using another AI tool.

NanoChat is made to be easy to copy, change, and learn from. The author thanks other projects and people for ideas, help, and computer power. The project is open source and uses the MIT license.

In the Hacker News comments, many people are excited about how simple and clear the project is. Some think it’s a great way to learn how LLMs work without needing a huge budget or team. Others like that it is easy to read and hack, unlike bigger, more complex AI projects. 

A few users point out that $100 is still expensive for many people, especially if they don’t have access to big GPUs. Some wonder if the model is useful for real jobs, since its quality is not close to top LLMs. There are discussions about using smaller GPUs, running on home computers, or working with cloud credits to save money.

Some commenters compare NanoChat to existing open-source models and frameworks. They ask about the model’s performance and if it can be improved with more data or tuning. Others appreciate the clear code and think it’s a good start for building personal or private chatbots. A few users ask technical questions about memory use, training data, and how to make the model bigger. Overall, people find the project inspiring and open for learning, but note it is not a replacement for the best commercial chatbots yet.

## First device based on 'optical thermodynamics' can route light without switches

- 原文链接: [First device based on 'optical thermodynamics' can route light without switches](https://phys.org/news/2025-10-device-based-optical-thermodynamics-route.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45522266)

A team at the University of Southern California made a new kind of device that can direct light without using any switches or outside controls. This device works by letting light follow the rules of thermodynamics, so the light finds its own way, much like how heat spreads in a gas.

In regular electronics and photonics, we need routers and switches to send signals to the right places—think of Wi-Fi routers or data center switches. But controlling light is hard, and standard optical routers depend on many switches and complex electronics, which can slow things down. The USC device is different: it uses the natural behavior of light in nonlinear systems. Imagine a marble rolling through a maze that guides itself, no matter where it starts. In the same way, the device is built so light always ends up in the right spot, all by itself.

This idea is called “optical thermodynamics.” The team noticed that, in nonlinear optical systems, light acts a lot like particles in a gas reaching equilibrium. They created a theory showing how light moves and organizes itself, just as gases do with pressure and temperature changes. In their experiment, the device let light go through two steps, like a gas expanding and then balancing out, so the light naturally flows to the correct output channel.

This new way could be very important for the future of technology. As chips and computers get faster, companies want to use light instead of electricity to move data. If light can route itself, devices can be simpler and use less energy. This idea could help with faster computers, better telecom networks, and safer ways to process information.

People in the Hacker News comments had a mix of reactions. Some were very excited, saying this could change how we build networks and computers, making them faster and more reliable. Others pointed out that “nonlinear” systems are often hard to control, so it’s impressive to see chaos turned into something predictable. A few users asked how this device compares to traditional optical switches—do we save energy, or is it just simpler? Some wondered if this will really help data centers soon, or if it’s still just for the lab. There were questions about how easy it will be to scale this technology for real-world use, and if it can handle lots of data at once. A few skeptics said we’ve seen cool optical ideas before, but they do not always make it to market. However, many agreed that using the laws of nature instead of fighting them is a clever and promising approach. Some also mentioned possible uses in quantum computing or secure communication, since routing light is important there too. Overall, people saw this as an interesting and hopeful step for photonics.

## Show HN: SQLite Online – 11 years of solo development, 11K daily users

- 原文链接: [Show HN: SQLite Online – 11 years of solo development, 11K daily users](https://sqliteonline.com/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45567770)

This post is about SQLite Online, a web-based SQL editor that has been built by one person over 11 years and now has 11,000 users per day. The site lets you write, run, and share SQL code right in your browser, and it supports many kinds of databases and tools.

The main new feature covered is a special way to create data charts using SQL. Instead of writing normal SELECT statements, you use new commands like QLINE-SELECT, QAREA-SELECT, QBAR-SELECT, QPIE-SELECT, and QBUBBLE-SELECT. These commands help you make different types of charts, such as line, area, bar, pie, and bubble charts, from your data.

To use these, you change your SQL query a little. For example, for a line chart, you write QLINE-SELECT instead of SELECT. You then pick which database columns go on the X and Y axes, and can set colors, point sizes, and labels. The documentation gives examples using a CSV with happiness data by country. You can create a virtual table from a CSV file online, then run these special SELECT queries to see charts right away.

This system works by mapping SQL columns to chart options. For example, 'x' and 'y' are for the axes, 'c' is for color, and 'v' is for the size of points. The examples show filtering data (like only countries with a high GDP) and coloring by region. Each chart type has its own special settings, but they all use SQL as the main language, making it easy for people who know SQL to also make charts.

People in the comments are impressed that one person built and ran this site for so long, calling it a big effort and very useful. Some users say they use SQLite Online often for quick database checks, learning, or sharing SQL problems with friends. Many like that it works with different databases, and that you do not need to install anything.

A few comments mention ideas for new features, like better support for mobile devices, or more export options for charts. Some people wonder about privacy and if their data is safe when using the online editor. Others suggest ways to improve the chart syntax, making it even easier or closer to standard SQL.

There are also comments from people who wish they had tools like this when they were learning SQL, saying it is great for teaching and for quick experiments. Some users ask about how the site is hosted and how it handles so many users. A few share that they have built similar tools, but keeping them running with high traffic is hard.

Overall, the comments show respect for the solo developer and excitement about having a free, easy SQL playground online. Some people share small bugs or things they wish worked better, but most are positive and thankful for the tool.

## Root cause analysis? You're doing it wrong

- 原文链接: [Root cause analysis? You're doing it wrong](https://entropicthoughts.com/root-cause-analysis-youre-doing-it-wrong)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45549060)

This article says most people do root cause analysis (RCA) the wrong way, because they look for just one simple cause when accidents happen in complex systems. It explains that real problems come from many different factors working together, not just one mistake or broken part.

The author gives a real example from their work: a software system failed, and the support team said the “root cause” was turning on a certain setting with multi-threading. The team fixed this, said the problem was solved, and moved on. But the author points out that this analysis stopped too soon. There were many reasons the failure happened, such as unclear system design, bad defaults, lack of validation, and poor testing. Good analysis should look at all these issues and ask more questions.

The article introduces a better way: Causal Analysis based on Systems Theory (CAST). This method says to first describe the whole system and its goals, then build a timeline of the accident, ask lots of questions, and look for unsafe interactions and missing controls. Instead of blaming one thing, CAST helps find many lessons and ways to make systems safer.

The article also explains some key ideas:
- Accidents happen when a system enters a hazardous state and meets bad luck in the environment.
- We cannot control the environment, so we must design systems to avoid hazards and limit damage if things go wrong.
- Human error is not the end of the story—it's the beginning. We should ask why the human made a mistake and how the system allowed it.
- People often make mistakes in analysis because of hindsight bias—they think causes are obvious after an accident, but they were not clear before.
- Systems are complex with many parts and feedback loops. Simple “chain of events” models miss important details, especially how parts interact.
- Good analysis includes social and technical factors, not just code or hardware.
- Safety is not about preventing all failures, but about controlling risks and making sure accidents are not severe.

In the Hacker News comments, some readers agree that real accidents are almost always more complex than they look. They share stories where blaming one root cause missed bigger issues, like poor communication or weak processes. Others say managers like simple answers because they are easier to report and fix, even if they don’t solve the real problem.

Some users discuss how RCA can be used well if you keep digging past the first cause and look at system design and human factors. A few mention the “Five Whys” method and how it often ends at blaming a person or a single action. Several readers recommend using methods like CAST or “blameless postmortems” to find deeper lessons.

A few commenters warn that in big companies, there is pressure to close incidents quickly, so teams do shallow analysis and move on. Others point out that accidents can be good for learning, but only if organizations are open to honest, deep investigation.

Many agree that systems thinking is hard but needed—real safety comes from understanding the whole system, not just fixing one bug. Some readers link to more resources and books about system safety, showing interest in learning better ways to understand and prevent accidents.

## Abstraction, not syntax

- 原文链接: [Abstraction, not syntax](https://ruudvanasseldonk.com/2025/abstraction-not-syntax)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45566198)

This article talks about why the main problem with configuration files is not their syntax, but the lack of abstraction. The author explains that many people are tired of YAML and are looking at other formats like TOML, JSON5, KDL, and more, but these changes often only affect how the files look, not how they work.

The article gives an example of a JSON configuration file for cloud storage buckets. It shows that using a different syntax, such as YAML, does not fix real problems—like bugs from copy-pasting or hard-to-spot mistakes (for example, a missing zero or a wrong region). The real issue is repetition and errors that come from writing similar blocks again and again.

The author says what we really need is abstraction—like having loops or formulas in configuration files. With abstraction, you can write code that builds the configuration, making it easier to avoid mistakes and update things in one place. For example, the article shows how a configuration language with loops and variables (like RCL) can make the setup much shorter and less error-prone. You only need to change a value in one spot, and you can add new databases with just one line.

But abstraction has trade-offs. If you use a programming language or a tool to generate your config files, you need an extra step to build the final files. It can also be harder to search for specific names (“greppability”), and too much abstraction can make things harder to understand. The author suggests checking in the generated files to help with these issues.

There are special tools like Cue, Dhall, Jsonnet, and RCL that help make configuration less repetitive. But even simple scripts in Python or Nix can help a lot. The key point is that reducing copy-paste and using data structures is safer than just making the files look nicer.

In the end, the author says it’s good to use simpler formats, but the real problem is not syntax—it’s the need for abstraction to manage complex configurations. For big projects, turning configuration files into code, at least a little, is usually better than sticking with plain data files.

In the comment section, many people agree that abstraction is more important than syntax. Some share stories about bugs caused by copy-pasting YAML or JSON and how using tools like Jsonnet or Dhall helped them. Others worry that adding programming features to config files can make them hard to understand for new team members or people who just want to read the data.

Some comments say that using code to generate configuration is great, but it can make debugging harder if you don’t keep the generated files. A few people mention that tools like Terraform or Ansible face the same issues: simple syntax is easy at first, but big projects need better ways to avoid repetition and mistakes.

Not everyone thinks abstraction is always good. One user says that for small files, plain data is easier, and adding loops or variables is overkill. Another person brings up the problem of “configuration drift” if the generated files get out of sync.

A few users point out that better editors and linters can catch mistakes, so maybe smarter tools could help more than new languages. Some people like TOML or HCL for their readability, but agree that they don’t solve the deeper issue.

Overall, the discussion shows that while people do care about clean syntax, most developers agree that abstraction and reducing repetition matter more for large, complex configurations. Many wish more tools made it easy to balance code and data in config files.

## Modern iOS Security Features – A Deep Dive into SPTM, TXM, and Exclaves

- 原文链接: [Modern iOS Security Features – A Deep Dive into SPTM, TXM, and Exclaves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09272)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45571688)

This article looks at new security features in iOS, focusing on SPTM, TXM, and Exclaves. These tools help make the iPhone’s core system (the XNU kernel) safer against attacks. In the past, the iOS kernel was like one big area where everything important happened; if one part got hacked, the whole system was in danger. Now, Apple is splitting up this area into smaller, safer zones. SPTM controls what types of data can go where in memory, keeping different tasks apart so one bad part can’t easily attack the rest. TXM checks if code is signed and allowed to run, making sure only trusted programs work on the phone. Exclaves are new areas outside the main system that handle very private data or tasks. The article explains how these parts talk to each other using special channels, like xnuproxy and Tightbeam IPC, which are made to be hard for hackers to break into. Moving important tasks away from the main kernel makes the system safer, even if a hacker gets into the kernel—they still can’t reach the most protected areas.

In the comments, some people are impressed by how much Apple is doing for security. Others worry that this makes it harder for developers to work on low-level tools or do security research. A few note that these changes remind them of older microkernel designs, and are glad to see Apple learning from past systems. There are questions about whether this will make jailbreaking impossible, and some think that’s a good thing, while others miss the freedom to tinker. Some commenters ask if these changes could slow down devices or introduce new bugs. A few security experts in the thread explain that while no system is perfect, breaking up the kernel is a strong step forward. There’s also talk about how these features could be used by other companies. Some users wonder if Android will follow with similar ideas. Lastly, a few people say that while security is better, user control over devices keeps getting weaker, and they hope Apple finds a better balance.

## Dutch government takes control of Chinese-owned chipmaker Nexperia

- 原文链接: [Dutch government takes control of Chinese-owned chipmaker Nexperia](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/13/dutch-government-takes-control-of-chinese-owned-chipmaker-nexperia.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45566644)

The Dutch government has taken control of Nexperia, a big chipmaker that was owned by a Chinese company. The reason is to protect important technology and keep it safe from foreign influence.

The article explains that Nexperia makes chips used in many devices, like cars and phones. The Dutch government was worried that China could use Nexperia’s technology for its own benefit or even for spying. Many countries are now careful about who owns companies that make important technology, especially chips. Chips are very important for computers, smartphones, cars, and even military equipment. The Dutch government now has special rights over Nexperia, which means they can stop some decisions or sales if they think it's risky. This is part of a bigger trend in Europe and the US, where governments worry about technology falling into the wrong hands. The article says that the US has already blocked some Chinese companies from buying American tech firms. The Dutch government says it does not want to hurt business but must protect national security. Nexperia can still make and sell chips, but the government will watch more closely. This move is also because of tension between China and Western countries about technology and trade. Nexperia’s Chinese owner, Wingtech, bought the company in 2018, but now, things have changed. The article notes that the Dutch action could affect other tech companies in Europe.

In the comments, some people say the government is right to protect important companies. They think chips are too important to let foreign governments control them. Others feel worried about more government control and think it could hurt business. A few commenters point out that China does the same thing with its own tech companies, so Europe is just protecting itself. Some users say this move might make it harder for foreign companies to invest in Europe. There are also people who wonder if this will really make technology safer or just more expensive. One person mentions that Nexperia’s chips are basic, not super high-tech, so the risk might be low. Another commenter thinks this is mainly about sending a message to China. Some worry that this could start a “tech war” with more trade rules and bans. Others remind everyone that countries have always tried to protect important industries. Some people feel sad that global business is getting harder. Finally, a few users say that, in the end, every country has to put its own security first.

## Don't Be a Sucker (1943) [video]

- 原文链接: [Don't Be a Sucker (1943) [video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGAqYNFQdZ4)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45573025)

This post shares a 1943 US government film called “Don’t Be a Sucker,” which warns against racism and hate. The movie shows how a hateful speaker tries to win over a crowd by blaming different groups for society’s problems. One listener is almost convinced, but then he speaks with a Hungarian refugee who explains how similar hate led to disaster in Nazi Germany. The film uses examples from Germany to show how Nazis targeted Jews, Catholics, Freemasons, and others. Scenes show people joining Hitler’s group and violence against those who were blamed. The message is that hate and division can break a country, and that no one is safe if such ideas are allowed to spread. The film calls for people to stand together and not let hate take hold.

On Hacker News, people say the film feels important today, not just in the past. Some think it is a strong reminder to watch out for voices that try to divide us. Others point out that the movie was made by the US Army, and wonder if the US always followed its own advice, especially looking at its own history of racism. A few users discuss how propaganda can be used for good or bad, depending on the message. Some share that they saw the film in school and it left a big impression. Others wish more people today would watch it, as they see similar tactics in politics now. One person worries that such lessons are often forgotten, and history repeats. Another points out that it is easy to think “it can’t happen here,” but the film shows that it really can. Some users debate if modern media does enough to teach these lessons. Overall, there is agreement that the film’s message is still very important.

## JIT: So you want to be faster than an interpreter on modern CPUs

- 原文链接: [JIT: So you want to be faster than an interpreter on modern CPUs](https://www.pinaraf.info/2025/10/jit-so-you-want-to-be-faster-than-an-interpreter-on-modern-cpus/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45560863)

This article looks at how hard it is to make a JIT compiler for PostgreSQL that runs faster than the normal interpreter, especially on modern CPUs. The author explains that CPUs today are very good at running code fast because they can do many things at once and guess what will happen next (branch prediction).

The article gives code examples showing how CPUs can run instructions out of order to save time, and how this affects the way interpreters and compilers work. It talks about the interpreter’s main loop, which uses a switch statement or jump table to decide what to do for each step. This makes a lot of jumps, which can slow things down if the CPU can’t guess them well. Some interpreters use a trick called “computed goto” to help the CPU predict jumps better.

For PostgreSQL, even a simple query like `SELECT a FROM table WHERE a = 42` ends up running many steps (opcodes), including checking for `NULL` values and calling a comparison function. The author tried some optimizations: removing unnecessary null checks, and making the most common operations (like comparing two integers) run faster by inlining the code instead of calling a function. These changes made the query run a bit faster—up to about 10% better.

The author also shows that the biggest speed-up comes from inlining the integer comparison, not from removing null checks. Still, the CPU’s branch predictor already does a lot to make the interpreter fast, so the JIT compiler isn’t always much better. The article ends by saying that, for now, the interpreter can almost keep up with the JIT because of how good CPUs are at running this kind of code. But there is still hope for future improvements, and the author asks for help from the community.

In the comments, some people agree that interpreters have gotten much faster thanks to CPU improvements and smart tricks like computed gotos. Others say that JIT compilers still have a place, especially for more complex queries or when more inlining is possible. A few say that for simple queries, the overhead of JIT might not be worth it, but for big or repeated queries, it could help more.

Some users point out that keeping the codebase clean can be hard if there are too many special “fast path” opcodes. Others think that performance gains of 10–20% are worth the effort, while a few say that users may not notice unless the gains are bigger. There are also comments about how hard it is to get funding or time for this kind of work, and some offer encouragement or ideas for more optimizations. A few suggest looking at what other databases or virtual machines do, since many of them use similar tricks. Overall, the community finds the work interesting and useful, but also sees the limits of how much faster things can get just by changing the interpreter or adding a JIT.

## JSON River – Parse JSON incrementally as it streams in

- 原文链接: [JSON River – Parse JSON incrementally as it streams in](https://github.com/rictic/jsonriver)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45518033)

JSON River is a small and fast tool for reading JSON as it arrives, instead of waiting for the whole thing. It lets you start working with parts of your data right away, which is useful when reading from a slow network or a big file. The tool is written in TypeScript, has no extra dependencies, and follows JavaScript standards, so it works anywhere JavaScript runs.

When you use JSON River, you get a series of "partial" results as more of the JSON comes in. For example, if your data is a user object with a name and a list of numbers, JSON River will first give you an empty object, then add the name letter by letter, then add the keys array one item at a time. You don’t have to wait for the complete file. You can see each step as the data grows.

The final result from JSON River is exactly the same as using JSON.parse on the full input. It also handles errors: if the input is not valid JSON, or if the data stops halfway, it stops and tells you. Some values like numbers or true/false/null are only given when they are complete, but strings, arrays, and objects grow as more content comes.

The parser follows some simple rules: once a value is a certain type (like an array or object), it stays that type as it grows. Only the last item in an array or object can change until it is finished. This makes it easy to work with the data as it streams in.

If you only need to parse small JSON files, the built-in JSON.parse is still much faster. There’s also another tool called stream-json, which is more complex, slower, but has more features if you want to only get part of the data. JSON River is focused on being small, fast, and simple.

Now, looking at the Hacker News comments, some users are happy to see a streaming JSON parser that is easy to use and works in modern JavaScript. Others mention that this is very handy when working with APIs or AI models that send long responses, since you don’t need to wait for everything to arrive before doing work. A few people compare JSON River to tools like stream-json, and note that while stream-json has more features, it is also slower and harder to use.

Some users talk about real cases where streaming is helpful, like working with logs or data pipelines. Others ask about error handling and if JSON River is as safe as JSON.parse. There are also comments about the limits of incremental parsing, for example, you only get partial strings or arrays, not partial numbers. A few people want more benchmarks or tests, but many agree the idea is simple and the tool is useful for the right jobs. Overall, the reaction is positive, with some technical questions and good suggestions for future updates.
