## Upcoming Changes to Let's Encrypt Certificates

- 原文链接: [Upcoming Changes to Let's Encrypt Certificates](https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/upcoming-changes-to-let-s-encrypt-certificates/243873)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46279241)

Let’s Encrypt is making changes to how it gives out security certificates for websites. The main updates include new root certificates, stopping support for TLS client authentication, and making certificates last for a shorter time.

First, Let’s Encrypt has created new “Generation Y” root and intermediate certificates. These work with the current “Generation X” roots, so most websites should not have any problems. If you use the usual (classic) setup, your certificates will change to Generation Y starting May 13, 2026. The new certificates will not support TLS client authentication because of new rules. Let’s Encrypt will stop supporting TLS client authentication from February 2026. If you need more time to switch, you can use the “tlsclient” profile until May 2026, which still uses the old roots. If you use “tlsserver” or “shortlived” profiles, you will get Generation Y certificates very soon. There are also new short-lived certificates, and these can now be used for IP addresses, not just domains. 

Let’s Encrypt is also following new rules that require certificates to be valid for a shorter time. Soon, you can try 45-day certificates with the “tlsserver” profile. In 2027, the default will become 64 days, and in 2028, it will go down to 45 days. Most users do not need to do anything, but you should read the linked blog posts for details if you want to know more.

In the Hacker News comments, some people worry that shorter certificate lifetimes will create more work and more chances for things to break, especially if automatic renewal systems fail. Others think that shorter lifetimes make the web safer, since stolen certificates will not last as long. A few users say they never had problems with Let’s Encrypt renewals and trust the automation. Some mention that older devices or systems may not trust the new roots, so there could be small issues for users with old phones or computers. Others like that Let’s Encrypt is still free and easy to use, and say that the changes are normal as security rules get stricter. One comment points out that supporting certificates for IP addresses is helpful for some use cases. Another user says that people should keep an eye on changes, but for most, everything will work without manual action. Some express thanks to Let’s Encrypt for making the web safer and simpler.

## Essential Semiconductor Physics [pdf]

- 原文链接: [Essential Semiconductor Physics [pdf]](https://nanohub.org/resources/43623/download/Essential_Semiconductor_Physics.pdf)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46256643)

This book is about the basic physics of semiconductors, which are the materials used to make things like transistors and computer chips. It is a set of lecture notes meant to help students and engineers understand how and why semiconductors work, without needing to use a lot of advanced math.

The book starts with the history and importance of semiconductors, explaining that they are everywhere in today’s world. It introduces key ideas: atoms have energy levels, but when many atoms form a crystal, these energy levels spread out into bands called energy bands. The two most important bands are the conduction band (where electrons can move freely) and the valence band (where electrons are usually found). There is a “band gap” between these bands—no electrons can have energies in this space. 

The book explains that at room temperature, a few electrons get enough energy to move from the valence band to the conduction band, breaking their bonds. This creates mobile electrons and “holes” (places where an electron is missing), which carry electric current. Semiconductors like silicon have just the right size band gap to allow this to happen sometimes, unlike metals (no band gap) or insulators (very big band gap).

Next, it describes different types of semiconductor materials: 
- Crystalline (ordered, high quality, expensive), 
- Polycrystalline (many small crystals, cheaper, used in solar cells), and 
- Amorphous (no order, cheapest, used in displays). 

The book shows how to describe the structure of crystals using Miller indices (a way to label directions and planes in a crystal), and why this is important in making devices.

It covers the different types of semiconductors, such as group IV (like silicon and germanium), III-V (like gallium arsenide), and II-VI. It explains the key properties: band gap and intrinsic carrier concentration (number of electrons and holes at a given temperature). Silicon is most popular not because it’s the best at conducting, but because its surface can be easily made clean and inactive with silicon dioxide.

The notes also explain the difference between direct and indirect band gap materials. Direct band gap semiconductors (like GaAs) can emit light easily, so they are used in LEDs. Indirect ones (like silicon) do not emit light well, so they are not used for this.

Finally, the book introduces doping, which means adding other atoms to the semiconductor to make it conduct electricity better. Adding atoms with more electrons (N-type) gives more free electrons. Adding atoms with fewer electrons (P-type) creates more holes. Doping is what makes it possible to build all the devices we use.

In the Hacker News comments, people praise the book for being clear and easy to read. Some say it is a great resource for beginners, especially because it does not use too much math. Others note that it is helpful even for people who work in software, as it explains the basics behind the hardware they use every day. Some users mention that they wish they had something like this when they were in school, and that the book helps connect old knowledge from physics and chemistry to real-world technology.

A few commenters discuss the value of open educational resources and are happy that this book is free to download. Others compare it with classic textbooks, saying this one is more modern and focused on understanding, not just solving equations. One user points out that even experienced engineers can learn new things or fill in gaps with this book. 

Some people ask technical questions about parts of the book, such as how certain band gap values are measured or why silicon is preferred over other materials. There are also suggestions from readers about how to teach this subject to students, like using more real-life examples or simple experiments. 

Overall, readers agree that this lecture note series is a good introduction to semiconductor physics for anyone interested in how computers and electronics work.

## A kernel bug froze my machine: Debugging an async-profiler deadlock

- 原文链接: [A kernel bug froze my machine: Debugging an async-profiler deadlock](https://questdb.com/blog/async-profiler-kernel-bug/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46280465)

This article tells the story of a Linux user whose machine kept freezing whenever he used async-profiler to check performance issues in QuestDB, a time-series database. After many tests, he realized the problem started after he updated his system to use Linux kernel version 6.17.

He first thought the bug was in QuestDB, but running older versions failed in the same way. He found reports from other users on Fedora and Ubuntu with the same problem, all running kernel 6.17. After some searching, he found a kernel patch that described and fixed the exact issue.

The bug happens when async-profiler uses the Linux perf_events feature to collect CPU usage data. Perf_events uses high-resolution timers (hrtimers) to send signals to threads. But a recent kernel change caused a deadlock: when a timer fires, the kernel tries to cancel the timer while still running its own callback. This causes the system to wait forever, freezing the machine.

The fix was to change the kernel code to use a non-blocking cancel function and a safety flag, so the kernel doesn’t wait on itself. The author also found a workaround: using async-profiler’s `-e ctimer` option, which avoids the broken kernel path.

Curious, he set up a virtual machine in QEMU, triggered the bug, and used GDB to debug the frozen kernel. He learned how to attach a debugger to a live kernel, inspect stack traces, and even tried to “resurrect” the deadlocked system by changing values in memory. His first try failed, but on his second attempt, he managed to unfreeze the virtual machine by killing the stuck process and releasing locks by hand.

In the Hacker News comments, many users praised the detailed write-up and the author’s persistence. Some said they learned a lot about kernel debugging and liked seeing clear steps for using QEMU and GDB. Others shared similar stories—how one small kernel change can cause big problems in real systems. Some pointed out that this kind of “self-deadlock” is a classic programming mistake, but easy to miss in complex kernel code.

A few users wondered why kernel tests didn’t catch this bug earlier, and some praised the quick fix by kernel developers. There was talk about the risks of using bleeding-edge distributions or not testing with the latest kernels before release. One commenter explained how perf_events and hrtimers work, agreeing that timer and signal code is tricky and hard to test.

Others discussed how to stay safe: avoid kernel 6.17, use the profiler’s workaround, or wait for the fixed kernel to reach your distro. Some developers said they might stick to LTS (long-term support) kernels for server workloads. A few joked about “playing God” with the kernel using GDB, but agreed it’s best left to test environments. Overall, people found the article helpful and inspiring, especially for anyone wanting to learn more about debugging or Linux internals.

## “Super secure” messaging app leaks everyone's phone number

- 原文链接: [“Super secure” messaging app leaks everyone's phone number](https://ericdaigle.ca/posts/super-secure-maga-messaging-app-leaks-everyones-phone-number/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46279123)

This article talks about a messaging app called Freedom Chat that claimed to be very secure, but actually leaked users’ phone numbers and PIN codes. The app was made by people with no experience in building mobile apps, but they said it was safe and private, using special encryption and a decentralized design.

A security researcher looked at how the app worked and found many problems. First, the app was not as private as it said; it collected lots of data and used normal servers, not a decentralized system. The way it used encryption was also weak, making it possible for others to see messages. The app also made a big mistake: when you opened a chat channel, it sent back a list of all members, showing their phone numbers and PINs. This means anyone could see the secret PINs of thousands of users.

The researcher then checked how the app finds which of your contacts use Freedom Chat, like WhatsApp does. There was no limit on how many phone numbers you could check, so it was possible to try every phone number in the US and find out which ones use the app. By matching the user IDs from this process to the channel list, you could link people’s phone numbers to their PINs.

The researcher wrote a script to do this, and in about a day, they were able to collect all Freedom Chat users’ phone numbers. The company was told about the problem, said they would fix it, and later claimed it was patched.

Hacker News commenters had many thoughts. Some said this was an example of why building secure apps is hard, and you should not make big promises if you lack experience. Others noted that privacy is not just about using encryption, but about designing the whole system to protect users. A few pointed out that the app’s creators did not seem to learn from earlier mistakes, since similar problems happened in their last app.

Some people were surprised that such simple mistakes could happen, like exposing sensitive data in an API response. Others said this kind of problem happens often when people rush to build something without good testing or outside review. There were also comments about how using phone numbers as user IDs is risky, and that apps should avoid this if possible.

A few users joked about the app’s political branding and wondered if it was just a marketing trick. Some were worried that people might choose this app thinking it was safer than WhatsApp, when it was actually less secure. Finally, many agreed that responsible disclosure by researchers is important, but companies also need to respond well and fix problems quickly.

## Cosmic-ray bath in a past supernova gives birth to Earth-like planets

- 原文链接: [Cosmic-ray bath in a past supernova gives birth to Earth-like planets](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adx7892)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46277090)

This article talks about how a past supernova, or star explosion, helped create planets like Earth. Scientists have long wondered why our Solar System has certain radioactive elements (called short-lived radionuclides, or SLRs) that helped make rocky, water-poor planets possible.

The article explains that these SLRs, such as aluminum-26, are important because their decay caused heat inside small rocks in the early Solar System. This heat dried out the rocks and led to planets like Earth, which has only a bit of water compared to “ocean planets.” The problem is, old models could not explain how so many SLRs got into the Solar System without destroying the disk of gas and dust that later became the planets.

The new idea, called the “immersion model,” says that when a nearby supernova exploded (about 1 light-year away), it sent a shockwave full of cosmic rays—very fast particles—over the young Solar System. These cosmic rays made new SLRs right inside the disk, while the supernova also sent in some SLRs directly. This model matches what scientists see in meteorites much better than the old ideas. It also doesn’t require the supernova to be dangerously close, so it wouldn’t break up the forming planets.

The model uses data from meteorites to check if the amounts of different SLRs fit. It also looks at how common it is for stars like our Sun to be near a supernova in their early years. The answer: it’s pretty likely, because most stars form in big groups where supernovae often happen. So, the same process that made Earth possible could happen around many other stars.

Some important points: the model explains why some bits of meteorite have less of certain SLRs—parts of the disk were protected from the cosmic rays. The model is also flexible; changing the supernova’s size or the distance only changes the results a little. This means the process is robust.

In the Hacker News comments, some users were excited that Earth-like planets might be common, not rare. Others pointed out that while the model sounds good, there are still many unknowns about how often these supernova events happen and how much they affect planet formation. One commenter asked if too many supernovae might actually destroy disks or make life less likely. A few readers discussed the technical side, like how cosmic rays create new elements, and asked about the timing of supernovae in star clusters. Another person brought up the risk of relying on meteorite data, since we only have a small sample.

Some users wondered if this changes our view of how special Earth is, or if it just means we need more data from other planetary systems. Others liked that the model brings together different ideas—supernova injection and cosmic ray bombardment—into one story. A few people mentioned that this work could guide future searches for life and Earth-like worlds. Overall, the discussion was hopeful but cautious, with a lot of curiosity about what new space missions and studies might reveal.

- 原文链接: [Chafa: Terminal Graphics for the 21st Century](https://hpjansson.org/chafa/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46278208)

This article is about Chafa, a tool that lets you see images and animations inside your terminal window. Chafa uses special symbols and colors so your terminal can show pictures that look pretty close to the real thing.

Chafa supports many popular image formats, even animated GIFs. It works with different terminal graphic standards like Sixels, Kitty, iTerm2, and Unicode mosaics, so it fits many setups. Chafa uses lots of Unicode symbols, not just the basic blocks, to make images look better. It also supports wide characters, so languages like Chinese and Japanese display well. You can load symbols from any font file, including TTF and OTF. Chafa can use different color modes, from simple 16-color up to Truecolor (millions of colors). It even supports transparency and can handle animations. The tool is made for speed—it uses SIMD and runs tasks in parallel. You can use Chafa not just for showing images, but also for making ANSI art or even for black and white printouts.

Chafa comes with a stable C API for developers, and it has detailed documentation and a help command. There are also galleries online to show off what Chafa can do. If you want to use it in other programming languages, there are Python and JavaScript bindings, so you can use Chafa in your own apps or web projects.

Now, let's look at what people on Hacker News said. Some users love Chafa because it makes the terminal more fun and useful, especially for people who spend a lot of time in the command line. Others are impressed by how well Chafa balances speed and image quality. A few users remember older tools that tried to do similar things but say Chafa is faster and easier to use. Some people point out that not all terminals support every feature, so results can vary depending on the user's setup. Others like that Chafa is open source and has bindings for different languages, which makes it great for developers. A few users say it’s mostly a fun tool, but not always useful for serious work. Some worry about accessibility, since graphics in terminals could confuse screen readers. Others ask about how color handling works and if Chafa can be used in scripts. Many say the documentation and gallery make it easy to get started. Finally, several users share creative ideas, like making terminal-based slideshows or art projects.

## US TikTok investors in limbo as deal set to be delayed again

- 原文链接: [US TikTok investors in limbo as deal set to be delayed again](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp34442z25ko)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46250259)

The article talks about the future of TikTok in the US, which is still not clear because a deal to sell the app keeps getting delayed. US lawmakers want TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, to sell the US part of the app or face a ban, but the deadline for this sale has moved several times. President Trump set a deadline for December, then pushed it to January 2026, but no sale has happened yet. Some investors, like Frank McCourt, say they are ready to buy TikTok’s US operations and have the money needed, but they are just waiting for the chance. The US government is worried that ByteDance could give user data to the Chinese government, but TikTok says these fears are not true. President Biden signed the law for the sale, and the Supreme Court agreed with it. Trump and his team have said a deal was very close and that major US tech leaders like Larry Ellison and Michael Dell would be involved. But after a meeting with China’s President Xi, there was still no agreement, and ByteDance has not said yes to selling. McCourt and his group want to run TikTok with only US technology and without the Chinese-made algorithm. He says this is important for US law and for user privacy.

In the Hacker News comments, some users think the US government is making the TikTok issue political, using it for power or votes. Others say they understand the national security fears but wonder if banning TikTok really makes Americans safer. A few people believe it will be very hard to separate TikTok from its Chinese technology, especially the recommendation algorithm, and worry this will hurt the app’s quality. Some users feel sorry for US investors who are left waiting and cannot plan. Others point out that many US tech companies also collect user data, so the focus on TikTok seems unfair. There are comments about how bans like this could hurt the idea of a free internet and may lead to more countries blocking each other’s apps. A few people doubt the deal will ever happen, saying the delays will just keep going. Some also discuss if US companies will really do a better job with privacy, or if this is just about business competition. In the end, the comments show both worry and confusion about the deal, and many wish the process was more open and clear.

## Carrier Landing in Top Gun for the NES

- 原文链接: [Carrier Landing in Top Gun for the NES](https://relaxing.run/blag/posts/top-gun-landing/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46274822)

This article explains how the landing sequence works in the NES game Top Gun. The author looked at the game’s code to find out exactly what you need to do to land your plane on the aircraft carrier.

To land, your plane’s altitude must be between 100 and 299, and your speed must be between 238 and 337. You also need to be lined up with the carrier at the end of the landing. The game shows you the center of these ranges on your screen, so you can aim for those numbers. Both altitude and speed are controlled by how you use the throttle and pitch of your plane. There’s no on-screen indicator for your heading, but if you’re not lined up, the game will warn you to go “Right!” or “Left!”

After about a minute of this landing sequence, the game checks if your numbers are correct. If you land well, you see a good cutscene. If you don’t, your plane crashes, but you still get to go to the next level. The article also shares technical details, like memory addresses where the game stores your speed, altitude, and heading. These numbers are saved in a special format called binary coded decimal, which makes it easier for the game to show them as text.

The author even provides part of the landing check code from the game. If you want to always land perfectly without trying, you can use a cheat code (Game Genie: AEPETA). There is also a detailed breakdown of what each part of the code checks—like if you’re too high, too fast, or not lined up.

In the comments, many people shared memories of struggling with this landing when they were kids. Some said they always crashed and thought the game was broken. Others are surprised to learn the landing is possible at all, because they never managed it. A few readers enjoyed seeing the actual code and liked learning how the game checks your numbers.

One person pointed out that the game is actually forgiving—if you crash, you still move to the next stage. Some users talked about how hard older games were compared to today’s games. Others discussed the use of binary coded decimal and why it was common in old games. A few readers joked about using cheat codes instead of learning to land. Some people said they now want to try landing again with this new knowledge. Overall, the comments mix nostalgia, technical details, and appreciation for the deep dive into classic game code.
