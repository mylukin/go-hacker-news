These options, called calls, were risky because they would expire on the same day. The trade was made just before a big announcement by Donald Trump about pausing tariffs, which caused the market to jump. The options quickly became worth over $70 million. This kind of precise timing suggests insider information may have been used.

The article notes that this wasn't just one lucky trade. Multiple similar trades happened around the same time, indicating a well-coordinated effort. Such trades are risky, and if the market hadn't moved as expected, the trader could have lost everything. The article hints that this might have been pre-planned, comparing it to historical market shocks where no such early bets were seen.

In the comments, people discuss whether the government, like the SEC, will investigate this as insider trading. Some say the SEC can track who made the trades but doubt they will act. There is skepticism about whether any investigation would be free from political influence. Others argue about whether insider trading laws should be different or even exist at all. Some commenters express cynicism about the current state of politics and law enforcement, suggesting that powerful people are often above the law. There's also concern about trust in the financial system and how such trades, if unchecked, could harm market integrity.

## Why 'Prince Rupert's Drop' Glass Is Strong Enough to Shatter a Bullet (2023)

- 原文链接: [Why 'Prince Rupert's Drop' Glass Is Strong Enough to Shatter a Bullet (2023)](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a40008994/why-the-prince-ruperts-drop-is-so-strong/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43639253)

The article from Popular Mechanics explores the surprising strength of "Prince Rupert's Drop" glass, which can even shatter a bullet. This unique glass shape is formed by dropping hot glass into cold water, creating a structure that's incredibly tough to break at the bulb but fragile at the tail.

The magic behind Prince Rupert's Drop lies in its formation process. When the molten glass hits cold water, the outer layer cools rapidly, creating a hard shell while the inside remains molten longer. This results in high compressive stress inside the bulb, making it extremely strong—so strong that a bullet can shatter when it hits the drop. Yet, a simple touch on the tail can cause the whole structure to explode, as the tension is released all at once. This peculiar combination of stress and tension gives the drop its unique properties and potential applications, like in strengthening the glass used in smartphones.

In the comments on Hacker News, readers shared various insights. One user mentioned a video showing a Prince Rupert's Drop resisting a hydraulic press, though others noted the use of softer metal cylinders in the demonstration. Some users pointed out that the drop's strength is mainly in compression and can be easily shattered by touching the tail. There was also discussion about the history and novelty of Gorilla Glass, used in smartphones, which applies similar principles to Prince Rupert’s Drop. Others debated the physical state of glass, with some users clarifying that glass isn't a liquid but has a disordered structure. The comments reflect a mix of fascination with the drop’s properties and skepticism about some demonstrations' accuracy.
