## Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY does not scale

- 原文链接: [Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY does not scale](https://www.recall.ai/blog/postgres-listen-notify-does-not-scale)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44490510)

This article talks about a scaling problem with Postgres’s LISTEN/NOTIFY feature. The team at Recall.ai found that when using LISTEN/NOTIFY with many concurrent writers, their database became very slow and even stopped working at times. 

The problem was that every time a NOTIFY command was used inside a transaction, Postgres would lock the entire database during the commit phase. This lock is global, meaning only one commit can happen at a time if NOTIFY was called. With many bots writing data and using NOTIFY, this caused a huge backlog of waiting processes. The CPU and disk usage went down because the system was stuck waiting for the lock, not doing real work.

They found this out by looking at logs during times of high load and noticing many queries waiting for "AccessExclusiveLock on object 0 of class 1262 of database 0". This kind of lock is hard to spot and not well known. The team checked the Postgres source code and mailing lists, discovering this lock is by design so NOTIFY events are delivered in the right order. But it’s a big problem if you have lots of writers.

To prove it, they ran tests with and without NOTIFY. With NOTIFY, the system stalled. Without it, the system ran fine and used all its resources. To fix the problem, they stopped using LISTEN/NOTIFY for this use case. Instead, they used simple HTTP requests to notify their bots, and everything worked smoothly again.

Commenters on Hacker News had many thoughts. Some agreed that LISTEN/NOTIFY is not meant for high-scale or high-throughput systems and shared their own scaling issues. Others pointed out that this is well documented, but many people are surprised when they hit this wall. A few people said you could use external pub/sub systems like Redis, RabbitMQ, or Kafka for such notifications, as they are built for these patterns.

Some readers defended Postgres, saying LISTEN/NOTIFY works well for small workloads or simple notifications, and the global lock keeps delivery order safe. Others wondered if Postgres could improve this or if the locking could be more fine-grained. A few mentioned possible workarounds, like batching notifications or moving them outside of hot write paths.

There was also debate about documentation—some said it’s not obvious enough that LISTEN/NOTIFY doesn’t scale, while others said it’s a known limitation for databases that focus on consistency. Some users shared that they switched to Redis or a message broker after hitting similar problems. Others asked if future versions of Postgres might solve this, but most agreed that external tools are the way to go for high-scale event notification.

## Final report on Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 in-flight exit door plug separation

- 原文链接: [Final report on Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 in-flight exit door plug separation](https://www.ntsb.gov:443/investigations/Pages/DCA24MA063.aspx)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44525468)

The article is about the final report on Alaska Airlines Flight 1282, where a door plug blew out of a Boeing 737-9 MAX plane during flight in January 2024. The report explains what happened, why it happened, and what should change to prevent this in the future.

The accident happened soon after takeoff when the left mid exit door plug separated from the plane at about 15,000 feet. This caused a loud noise and a hole in the side of the plane. There was rapid depressurization, but the crew followed emergency steps and landed safely. One flight attendant and seven passengers had minor injuries, but everyone else was okay. The door plug and some parts of the plane’s interior were found on the ground. Investigators noticed that bolts meant to hold the door plug in place were missing.

The main reason for the accident was that Boeing did not give enough training or clear instructions to workers, so the bolts were not put back correctly during manufacturing. Also, the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) did not catch these problems because their checks were not good enough. The report says both Boeing and the FAA need to improve how they handle building and checking planes.

New recommendations include: FAA should make sure all planes with this kind of door plug get a safer design, improve how they check for problems in factories, and keep better records. Boeing should finish work on a safer door plug, train workers better, and make sure they follow rules for installing parts. There are also suggestions to improve voice recorders on planes, make emergency oxygen easier to use, and encourage child safety seats. The report calls for better training, better tracking of problems, and a review of Boeing’s safety culture.

In the comments, some people say this shows Boeing has deep problems with quality control. They worry that cost-cutting and weak management led to mistakes. Others point out that the FAA should have been stricter and done more checks. Some users share stories about working in the airline industry, saying mistakes like missing bolts should never happen. A few commenters note the flight crew did a great job keeping everyone safe. Some wonder if other planes have the same risk, and if flying is still safe. There are calls for more transparency and for Boeing to regain public trust. Others debate how much blame should go to workers versus company leaders. Some say the problems are bigger than just Boeing and need industry-wide changes. A few people think air travel is still safer than most other options, but agree that strong changes are needed now.

## FOKS: Federated Open Key Service

- 原文链接: [FOKS: Federated Open Key Service](https://foks.pub/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44520419)

FOKS is a new open-source service that gives you end-to-end encrypted storage for git and key-value data, designed to be safe even against quantum computers. It lets you use git just like normal, but your files and even file names are encrypted before leaving your computer, so the server can never see your real data. FOKS is federated, so anyone can host their own server, and teams can work together across different servers with the same strong security.

The system uses post-quantum secure cryptography, mixing standard algorithms with new ones that should stay safe even if someone invents a quantum computer. You can save both small secrets (like passwords) and big files, all protected by encryption that happens on your device. FOKS also has strong team and device management. You can organize users into teams, give them different roles, and even have teams inside teams. If you lose a device, you can easily revoke its access, and FOKS will update the keys everywhere to keep things safe.

FOKS uses a simple key structure that starts with device keys (like your laptop, backup codes, or a YubiKey), then builds up to user keys, and finally to team keys. It keeps track of changes using signature chains and Merkle trees, which help everyone trust the server is not cheating or hiding data. The system avoids fancy cryptography when it isn’t needed, using well-tested code from the Go language and the NaCl library.

The project is open-source under the MIT license. You can download and run it for free, build it yourself, or use the official servers. The team says they are self-funded, with no outside investors, and want to avoid “vendor lock-in.” Anyone can run a server, and servers can talk to each other, just like email.

A lot of the top comments on Hacker News are positive about the open-source and federated design. Some people compare FOKS to Keybase, which had similar ideas but is now owned by a big company. Many users say they like that FOKS wants to be “boring” and simple with its cryptography, instead of using risky new tools. Some are happy about post-quantum security, while others wonder if it’s needed right now or if it might add complexity.

There are questions about how hard it will be for regular users to set up and manage their own servers. A few people ask about the risks if you lose your device keys, and what happens if a server goes down or gets hacked. Some discuss whether FOKS could be used for other things, like password management or sharing private data outside of code. Other users are excited about possible mobile apps or web interfaces in the future.

A few comments mention that trust in end-to-end encryption only works if the source code is truly open and easy to build. Some worry that, even with strong security, it can be hard to convince companies to switch away from services like GitHub. Still, many agree that having more options for secure, private, and federated tools is a good thing, and they hope FOKS keeps developing.

## Bret Victor on why current trend of AIs is at odds with his work

- 原文链接: [Bret Victor on why current trend of AIs is at odds with his work](https://dynamicland.org/2024/FAQ/#What_is_Realtalks_relationship_to_AI)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44522076)

This article is about Bret Victor’s Dynamicland project and why the current trend of AI is very different from his vision. Dynamicland is a physical space and system called Realtalk, where people work together in person using real objects, not just screens and code.

The main idea is to create a “humane dynamic medium”—a way for everyone, not just experts, to use computers by working with real materials in a shared space. In Dynamicland, you don’t “program” in the usual way. Instead, you arrange cards, objects, and drawings, and the system responds, so people can see, change, and understand everything happening. It is meant to be open, transparent, and easy for anyone to explore or fix. There is no black box or hidden logic.

Realtalk avoids the idea of “users” and “interfaces.” Everything is visible and physical, so anyone can touch, move, and change things directly. Projects look handmade because people make and remake them as needed, using simple materials like paper, but they can also be as polished as people want.

Dynamicland is against the idea of mass-produced, closed systems where only a few people understand what’s inside. They want systems that communities can build and adapt themselves. The space is focused on group work, not just individuals, and on making people more capable instead of doing things for them.

About AI, the FAQ explains that current AI systems (like deep learning models) are not transparent or easy to understand. They need huge datasets and are often “black boxes,” making decisions that even experts can’t always explain. This is the opposite of what Dynamicland wants. They think computers should know as little as possible, to give people more freedom and flexibility. AI often tries to do things for you, but Dynamicland wants tools that help people learn and grow, not just get things done. They worry that AI makes people too dependent and less able to understand the world themselves.

In the comments, many people support Bret Victor’s vision, saying today’s computers and AI are hard to understand and control. Some wish more projects focused on helping people learn, not just consume. Others think Dynamicland’s approach is too idealistic or not practical for most people, since it needs special spaces and materials.

Some developers ask if Dynamicland can scale or become popular, or if it will stay a small, local project. A few are excited about how it mixes real objects and computers, but wonder if it will ever be as powerful as normal software. Others point out that AI can sometimes help people, like with voice recognition, but agree it should be more transparent.

Some users compare Dynamicland to early personal computers, when people could open them up and understand how they worked. They say modern tech has lost that feeling. Others argue that most people just want things to work and don’t care about how they work inside. There are also questions about privacy, with some worried about cameras, but others reassured by Dynamicland’s focus on not tracking people.

Overall, the discussion is lively, with some loving the vision of open, understandable computing, and others doubting if it can compete with big, closed AI systems. Many agree that today’s tech often feels like magic, and that’s not always a good thing.

## Flix – A powerful effect-oriented programming language

- 原文链接: [Flix – A powerful effect-oriented programming language](https://flix.dev/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44521224)

Flix is a new programming language focused on managing side effects in code, making programs easier to understand and maintain. It mixes ideas from functional, imperative, and logic programming, and is built by researchers and open-source contributors.

Flix has strong support for tracking effects—like reading files or changing variables—so you always know what a function might do. You can define your own effects and handlers, allowing you to build custom control structures. The language uses features such as algebraic data types, pattern matching, extensible records, and traits. Flix tracks whether code is pure (with no side effects) or impure, and this information flows through higher-order functions. For example, if you use `List.map`, Flix will know if the mapping function is pure or not.

Algebraic effects let you keep code pure except for certain effects, which you can handle separately. Flix supports local mutation within safe regions, so you can write efficient code with mutable data but keep the outside interface pure. The language can reflect on purity, letting libraries choose between eager, lazy, or parallel evaluation automatically. Flix makes it easy to run pure code in parallel using lightweight threads. Structured concurrency ensures threads are managed safely and don’t outlive their region.

Flix offers higher-kinded types, associated types and effects, and monadic and applicative for-yield expressions, making it powerful for abstractions. It works well with Java, so you can use Java libraries and tools. Flix also has first-class support for Datalog, a logic programming language, and enhances it with lattice semantics to solve complex problems like recursive dependencies.

The Flix compiler is fast and takes advantage of multi-core processors, compiling code in parallel and incrementally. There’s a full-featured standard library and strong integration with Visual Studio Code, offering features like syntax highlighting, error messages, auto-completion, and refactoring tools.

In the Hacker News comments, some users are excited about Flix’s effect system and its combination of functional and logic programming. They like the clear tracking of purity and the ability to define custom effects. Others compare Flix to languages like Haskell, OCaml, and Scala, noting similarities and differences, especially around effect handling and type systems. A few users are impressed by the Datalog integration, saying it opens up new ways to solve certain problems.

Some commenters wonder about real-world adoption, the learning curve, and how Flix compares to mature languages in terms of tooling and community. There are questions about performance, especially since Flix runs on the JVM, but others point out that JVM integration makes it practical and gives access to many libraries and tools. A few people express concerns about the complexity of the language, but others say the features make sense for advanced users. Overall, the community seems interested and positive, with some users already trying Flix for side projects or research.

## Launch HN: Leaping (YC W25) – Self-Improving Voice AI

- 原文链接: [Launch HN: Leaping (YC W25) – Self-Improving Voice AI](item?id=44523523)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44523523)

Leaping is a new company making a voice AI that can learn and improve over time. They want to help businesses use voice assistants that get better the more you use them.

Leaping’s AI listens to people and tries to understand what they want. It can change its answers and get smarter by learning from mistakes. The team says you do not need to write special code or rules for their system. Instead, the AI uses feedback to fix itself. For example, if a customer asks about a product and the AI gives a bad answer, it will notice and try to do better next time. Leaping says their voice AI is fast and can be used on phone calls or in chat. They hope it will save companies time and money because it can handle lots of calls on its own. It works for many types of businesses, like online shops, banks, or hospitals. The team also says you can add your own information, so the AI knows about your products or services. They believe this will help companies give better help to their customers. Leaping is part of Y Combinator and is just starting out, so they are looking for people to try their product.

People in the comments are interested in how Leaping’s AI learns. Some are excited about not needing to write rules, saying it could save a lot of work. Others wonder if the AI can really understand tricky questions, or if it will just memorize answers. A few say voice AI is hard because people speak in many ways and make mistakes. Some worry about privacy, asking how Leaping keeps voice data safe. There are also questions about how well it works with many languages or accents. Some people want to know if it is better than other voice bots, or just the same. A few give ideas, like using it for doctor’s offices or for small online shops. Others say it will be hard to get companies to trust a new AI. Many wish the team good luck and say they are interested to see what happens next.

## Measuring the impact of AI on experienced open-source developer productivity

- 原文链接: [Measuring the impact of AI on experienced open-source developer productivity](https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44522772)

A new study looked at how AI tools affect experienced open-source developers working on their own big projects. The main finding is surprising: using AI made these skilled coders 19% slower, not faster, on real tasks.

The study used a fair test: 16 top developers from large, well-known open-source repos worked on real issues, sometimes with AI help (using tools like Cursor Pro and Claude 3.5/3.7), and sometimes without. Each issue was randomly assigned to “AI allowed” or “no AI,” and coders logged their time. On average, tasks took about two hours, and developers got paid well for their time. The researchers made sure the test was fair: the tasks were real, the PRs were good quality, and the AI models were top-of-the-line for 2025. 

What’s really interesting is that the developers thought AI would make them 24% faster, and even after seeing the slowdown, they still believed AI had sped them up! The study checked many possible reasons for the slowdown. It was not because of cheating, lazy work, or the AI tools being too old. The PRs were still good, and the effect showed up in many ways of counting the data.

The study points out that earlier benchmarks and news stories might not match real-world results. Benchmarks are often simple, don’t care about code style, docs, or tests, and may overestimate AI’s skill. On the other hand, real-world stories about AI saving time can be based on memory or excitement, not careful measurement. The truth is likely somewhere in the middle: AI is great on some tasks, but may not help (or even might slow you down) on complex, high-quality open-source work.

The authors stress that their study does NOT mean AI cannot help other developers, or that things won’t change soon. They only tested experienced coders on hard, real tasks in big open-source repos. Maybe AI could help more with other types of work, or with different tools or training. The main takeaway is that careful, real-world tests matter.

Looking at top Hacker News comments, many developers were surprised or even skeptical about the results. Some said this matches their own experience: AI is great for small scripts or learning new things, but gets in the way for deep work on big codebases. Others argued that the tooling might still be too clunky, or that people need more practice to use AI well—like learning to ride a bike, not instant magic. A few pointed out that AI can actually make things slower by giving wrong answers, making code that doesn’t fit the style, or just adding confusion.

On the other hand, some users felt the test was too narrow. They said not everyone is an expert, and for less experienced coders or for “boring” tasks, AI can still be a huge help. Others wondered if the AI tools would get much better soon, or if new ways of working with AI would bring the promised speedup. A few reminded everyone that self-reported stories (good or bad) are often biased, and that we need more careful studies like this to see the real picture. But almost everyone agreed: the impact of AI on real coding is still an open question, and it’s changing fast.
