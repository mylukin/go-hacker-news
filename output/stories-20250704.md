## Everything around LLMs is still magical and wishful thinking

- 原文链接: [Everything around LLMs is still magical and wishful thinking](https://dmitriid.com/everything-around-llms-is-still-magical-and-wishful-thinking)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44467949)

This article talks about how people see large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT as either magical helpers or useless tools. The writer explains that there is a big gap between people who love these tools and people who think they never work.

The article says we don’t have good ways to compare people’s experiences with LLMs. We don’t know what kind of projects they use them on, how much skill the users have, what languages or codebases they work with, or how much extra work is needed to fix or check what the AI does. Because of this, it’s hard to know if someone’s good or bad experience is normal or rare. The author also points out that LLMs are not always predictable; sometimes they give good answers, and other times they fail, even on the same problem.

The article criticizes people who hype up LLMs without giving details. For example, some “industry leaders” make big claims about how much LLMs help, but they don’t share important facts, like the size of the codebase, the types of bugs fixed, or how much extra work was needed. These posts get a lot of attention online, even though they leave out important information.

The author shares their own experience, saying they use many AI tools every day for coding, design, and more. Sometimes these tools work great, sometimes they don’t work at all. The author believes LLMs are just statistical machines, not magic and not real engineering. Still, the conversation around them often treats them as one or the other.

People in the comments have many different opinions. Some say that critics of LLMs just don’t understand the new technology. Others notice that people’s results with LLMs are very different—some get good help, others don’t. Many agree that it’s hard to compare experiences because everyone uses these tools in different ways and on different problems.

Some commenters are excited about LLMs and share stories about how they help with coding or writing. Others are more careful, saying that LLMs sometimes save time but often need a lot of checking and fixing. A few point out that LLMs can make mistakes that are hard to notice, which can be risky for real work.

Some people feel the hype around LLMs is too strong, just like it was with crypto in the past. They think people should be more critical and not believe every big claim. Others think the technology will get better and that it’s worth trying new tools, even if they are not perfect yet. Overall, the comments show that people are still figuring out what LLMs are good for and what their limits are.

## Prompting LLMs is not engineering

- 原文链接: [Prompting LLMs is not engineering](https://dmitriid.com/prompting-llms-is-not-engineering)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44468058)

The article says that “prompt engineering” for large language models (LLMs) is not real engineering. The author argues that prompt engineering is just guessing how to talk to a black box, where we do not know how the model works, what data it was trained on, or even if the system will act the same way twice.

The article lists many things about LLMs that users can’t control or even see, like the training set, weights, model limits, or software layers between the user and the model. The author says prompt engineers claim they can get better results with special prompts, but they do not explain what “better” really means. Also, the author says LLMs can change in quality at any time, for reasons the user does not know—like if there are too many users at once.

The article compares prompt engineering to homeopathy, suggesting there is little real proof behind it. It mentions that when people check prompt tricks more carefully, the supposed benefits disappear. For example, “chain-of-thought” prompts were once called amazing, but studies found they only help for very narrow problems, and only if the examples are very specific. As models get stronger, like OpenAI’s o3 model or Google’s Gemini 2 Pro, the article says the new prompt techniques are just as unreliable as the old ones. The author compares these methods to rituals based on hope or fear, not science—so, not engineering.

In the comments, some people agree with the author and say prompt engineering is mostly hype. They say it’s guessing, not real engineering, and think it will not last as LLMs improve. A few say that prompt engineering is like folklore: tricks that work sometimes, but not in a reliable way. Some compare it to learning to talk to a search engine or writing Google queries—useful, but not “engineering.”

Other commenters disagree. They argue that figuring out how to get the most from a powerful but mysterious tool does have value. They say prompt engineering is like using any tool with unknown parts—like using APIs without seeing the code. Some say that, even with black boxes, there can be skill in getting better results, and that this kind of work may become more important as LLMs are used in business.

A few mention that, in practice, companies are already hiring for prompt engineering roles, and these jobs often pay well. Others point out that, even if the science is weak, there are ways to test prompts and measure results, making it more useful than just random guessing. Some also note that, as LLMs become more stable and transparent, prompt engineering could turn into something more like real engineering. Overall, the comments show a split: some think prompt engineering is a fad, while others see it as a growing, if imperfect, field.

## Mini NASes marry NVMe to Intel's efficient chip

- 原文链接: [Mini NASes marry NVMe to Intel's efficient chip](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/mini-nases-marry-nvme-intels-efficient-chip)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44465319)

This article talks about small Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices that use NVMe SSDs and efficient Intel chips, which are good for people who want less storage and smaller setups at home. The author compares three mini NAS models: GMKtec G9, Aiffro K100, and Beelink ME mini, all based on Intel N100/N150 chips.

The author’s storage needs dropped from 120 TB to just 6 TB after moving his work out of his home studio, making these small NAS boxes an option. All three devices have several NVMe slots—four or more—and support 2.5 Gbps networking. The GMKtec and Beelink models even have two network ports each. The main differences are in cooling, noise, features, and price.

The GMKtec G9 is the cheapest, but the first version had problems with overheating when used with four NVMe drives. The company later made a new design with bigger cooling vents. The Aiffro K100 is smaller, cools better, and is very quiet, but costs more and has only one network port, no WiFi, and no built-in eMMC storage. The Beelink ME mini is the quietest and has six NVMe slots, but most slots have slower connections. It comes with eMMC storage and a built-in power supply, which is rare in these mini PCs. Each device has trade-offs: price, cooling, expandability, and power use.

The G9 is best for people on a budget, but only if the new cooling works well. The K100 is most power-efficient and smallest, but expensive and missing some features. The Beelink has the most NVMe slots and is quiet, but that may split bandwidth and make each drive slower. The author says you should pick a NAS based on what matters most to you.

In the comment section, some people like the move to smaller, more power-saving home servers. Others think these mini NAS devices are still too new and might have problems with cooling or speed. A few users worry about the limited bandwidth when many SSDs share the same PCIe lanes, which can slow things down for big workloads. Some think that built-in power supplies are a nice touch, while others worry they could make the small boxes hotter and harder to fix if they break. There are suggestions to just use a regular PC or old laptop as a NAS if you don’t need many drives. Some users wish these boxes had better software support out of the box, while others appreciate the low noise and small size. Many agree that each model makes a different set of trade-offs, so picking the right one depends on your own needs. Overall, people are interested but cautious about these new mini NAS choices.

## How to Incapacitate Google Tag Manager and Why You Should (2022)

- 原文链接: [How to Incapacitate Google Tag Manager and Why You Should (2022)](https://backlit.neocities.org/incapacitate-google-tag-manager)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44466697)

This article talks about Google Tag Manager (GTM) and why it’s a big problem for online privacy. The author explains that GTM is a tool that helps websites load tracking scripts in a way that is hard to spot and even harder to block.

GTM lets websites track almost everything you do, like mouse movements, clicks, scrolling, and even how long you look at a page. It works closely with Google Analytics 4, which is now much more detailed than the old version. The author says this combo makes it easy for any website to collect deep information about you, not just big companies.

Websites are now moving tracking from third-party cookies to first-party cookies, making blocking harder. Some sites even run GTM from their own servers, so normal browser blockers don’t work. Even if you block third-party cookies and scripts, these new tricks can let tracking continue.

The article’s main advice is to disable JavaScript in your browser. This stops most of GTM’s tracking abilities because almost all tracking needs JavaScript. The author also suggests blocking all cookies, both first-party and third-party, except for sites you trust. Using browser extensions like uBlock Origin can help, especially if you turn off JavaScript and block all third-party content.

There are other extreme methods, like blocking images (to stop tracking pixels) or using text-based browsers like Lynx. But these can make many sites hard or impossible to use. The author points out that many sites now break on purpose if you disable JavaScript, just to force you to allow tracking.

The article ends by saying it’s important to keep blocking these trackers, even if it makes using the web harder. If enough people block them, companies might be forced to stop using such invasive tools.

In the Hacker News comments, some people agree with the article and say they also block JavaScript and cookies for privacy. They share tips about using uBlock Origin and other privacy tools. Others think the article is too extreme and say disabling JavaScript breaks too many websites, making the web almost unusable for normal people.

A few readers point out that not all uses of Google Tag Manager are evil. Some developers use it just to see how many people visit their site or what pages are popular. They think it’s unfair to say all tracking is bad.

Some commenters talk about how hard it is to keep ahead of new tracking tricks, and how big companies will always try to find new ways to follow users. Others wonder why governments and public sites use Google Tag Manager, since it gives Google even more data about citizens.

There are also questions about practical steps: some want more details on blocking tracking pixels, or how to keep using necessary web tools without giving up privacy. One person suggests that a better answer is to make privacy-friendly websites and support businesses that don’t rely on tracking.

A few people remind others that blocking everything can feel like fighting the whole web, and it can be tiring. But many agree that raising awareness about these problems is important, even if not everyone can follow all the strict advice.

## EverQuest

- 原文链接: [EverQuest](https://www.filfre.net/2025/07/everquest/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44465731)

This article is about the history and rise of EverQuest, one of the first big online multiplayer games, and how it became so popular. It explains how EverQuest built on ideas from earlier games like Ultima Online, but made changes that helped it succeed.

EverQuest started as a side project inside Sony, a company better known for making the PlayStation and sports games. The main person behind EverQuest, John Smedley, loved Dungeons & Dragons and wanted to make a game where people could play together online. He found two developers, Brad McQuaid and Steve Clover, who had made a fantasy game called WarWizard. Together, they wrote a detailed plan for EverQuest, making the game simple, fun, and easy to play. Unlike Ultima Online, which wanted to create a real digital world with player governments and open battles, EverQuest focused on quests, fighting monsters, and working with friends.

One big lesson EverQuest learned from Ultima Online was about player killing. In Ultima Online, players could kill each other, and this led to lots of problems. Many people would join the game, get killed by others, and never come back. EverQuest made it impossible for players to attack each other on most servers, so the game felt safer and more welcoming. EverQuest also used bright, simple 3D graphics, which were new and exciting at the time. The team shared news about the game on the internet to attract fans, and when the game launched in 1999, thousands joined right away.

EverQuest grew fast, reaching over half a million players in a few years. Players paid a monthly fee and could also buy expansion packs with new areas and features. This made EverQuest very profitable, but also meant new players had to spend a lot to catch up. Still, many stayed because they had built up strong characters and friendships in the game. Some players even sold rare items for real money online.

But there were worries, too. Some people played so much that it hurt their lives outside the game. There were sad stories about people losing jobs, family problems, and even deaths linked to playing too much. This started a big discussion about game addiction and the responsibility of game companies.

In the Hacker News comments, some people share fond memories of playing EverQuest. They talk about how the game helped them make friends and learn teamwork. Others say they remember the long hours, the hard work to level up, and how tough the game could be. Some users point out that EverQuest was very different from today’s games, with less hand-holding and more chances to fail. A few think the game was too addictive and worry about the dark side of online worlds. Others discuss how EverQuest’s focus on fun over realism made it popular, while some wish the game had kept more of the open-world freedom from earlier games. There are also comments about how EverQuest’s monthly fees and expansions started trends that are common in online games today. Some people miss the old days of tight online communities, while others feel modern games are better balanced for real life. Overall, the comments show a mix of nostalgia, criticism, and respect for how EverQuest changed gaming.

## The story behind Caesar salad

- 原文链接: [The story behind Caesar salad](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/story-behind-caesar-salad)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44467312)

Caesar salad is now over 100 years old and was not made by a Roman emperor, but by an Italian chef in Tijuana, Mexico. The article tells how Caesar Cardini created the salad in 1924 when his restaurant ran out of food on a busy night, so he made a new dish with what he had left. 

The first Caesar salad had whole romaine lettuce leaves, garlic croutons, and a dressing made with raw egg yolk, anchovies, garlic, mustard, lemon, salt, pepper, and parmesan cheese. The salad was made right at the table in front of guests, adding fun to their meal. Caesar salad soon became popular in the United States and around the world. Some people say Caesar’s brother, Alex, added anchovies and mustard, while others say a cook named Livio Santini used his mother’s recipe. Still, most agree the salad started in Tijuana. Today, you can eat Caesar salad at many places, sometimes with twists like beef tartare or Mexican chili flavor. Most restaurants now make the salad in the kitchen, but some still do the old tableside show.

The article also lists places to try the salad, like Caesar’s in Tijuana, where the dish started, and other restaurants in the US that serve their own versions. Some add chicken, salmon, or even a whole grilled lemon.

In the Hacker News comments, many people were surprised to learn the salad was invented in Mexico, not Italy or Rome. Some shared memories of eating the salad made tableside, saying it made the meal special. Others talked about how the recipe has changed, with some liking the original raw egg and anchovy dressing, and others preferring modern versions with cooked eggs or no fish. A few people said they do not like raw eggs in food, while some enjoy making the dressing from scratch at home. There were jokes about how many “Caesar” foods have nothing to do with Julius Caesar. Some users pointed out how immigrant stories often shape popular foods, and others asked if the dish could be made vegan. Finally, a few debated if the true inventor was Caesar, Alex, or Livio, but most agreed that the salad’s story adds to its charm.

## Why I left my tech job to work on chronic pain

- 原文链接: [Why I left my tech job to work on chronic pain](https://sailhealth.substack.com/p/why-i-left-my-tech-job-to-work-on)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44464068)

This article is about someone who left their tech job to focus on helping people with chronic pain. The writer had their own long struggle with pain in different parts of their body, which changed their life and made them very curious about the topic.

They could not do things they loved, like playing sports, making music, or even working well. This experience made them look deeper inside themselves and learn more about their mind and body, which helped with their recovery. After getting better, the writer decided to help others by starting a blog to explain chronic pain and share ways to recover.

The blog will cover what chronic pain is, why it happens, and how people can get better. It will talk about pain science, the role of the brain, how stress and personality matter, and practical exercises to try. The writer says many people suffer from chronic pain, but new science shows that many can recover, especially with mind-body methods. They share that a recent study showed 66% of people got much better after six months of this kind of treatment, which is better than surgery or regular therapy.

The writer also shares that they did not believe in mind-body methods at first, but changed their mind after learning more and seeing results. They invite both people with pain and people just interested in health to join the blog. The writer is not a doctor, but they want to help and connect with others.

In the comments, some people praise the writer’s courage to leave a stable job for a personal mission. Others share their own stories about living with chronic pain, saying it is hard to explain to friends or doctors. Some readers are interested in the mind-body approach, but a few are skeptical, saying it may not help everyone or that it is not a cure for all types of pain.

A few users discuss the science behind chronic pain, linking to more studies about the brain’s role in pain. Others say that even if mind-body methods do not work for everyone, it is good to have new ideas and more hope. Some comments warn that people should still see doctors and not ignore possible physical causes. A couple of readers ask for more details about the exercises and tools that will be shared in the blog. Others thank the author for being open and say they look forward to reading more about the topic.

## Being too ambitious is a clever form of self-sabotage

- 原文链接: [Being too ambitious is a clever form of self-sabotage](https://maalvika.substack.com/p/being-too-ambitious-is-a-clever-form)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44467912)

The article says that being too ambitious can stop us from doing real creative work. It explains how we often imagine perfect projects in our minds, but when we try to make them real, they never match our dreams. The writer calls this problem the "taste-skill gap." Our ability to judge good work grows faster than our ability to make good work, so we feel bad about our results and sometimes give up.

The article uses many examples. A child draws without fear, but as they grow, they start to judge their own work and may stop drawing. Many adults avoid real work by planning and dreaming instead of starting. This feels like hard work, but it is really just avoiding the risk of failure. The article tells a story about a photography class—one group took many photos, while another tried to take just one perfect photo. In the end, the group that took many photos had better results. The lesson is that practice and making mistakes lead to real learning and skill.

The article says that planning and dreaming can trick our brains. We feel like we are working, but we are not making anything real. Social media shows us only the finished, perfect results, not the many failures and efforts behind them. This makes people think success comes easily, but in truth, every good work comes from many bad ones.

To really learn and improve, we must accept being beginners and making mistakes. The writer shares their own story of writing many pieces before finding success. They say that starting is hard, but the real challenge comes later, when the first excitement fades. The key is to keep going, learn from each attempt, and not worry about being perfect.

In the Hacker News comments, some people agreed strongly with the article. They said they have seen the same problem in programming, startups, and art. Many liked the story of the photography class, saying it matches their own experience—practice beats planning. A few commenters said it is easy to fall into planning forever, especially with so many books and podcasts about "how to start" things.

Others pointed out that some planning is still important. One person warned that "just doing" without any thought can waste time or lead to bad results. Some said that fear of failure is not the only problem; lack of time or resources can also stop people from starting. There was also debate about how social media and modern culture make us afraid to show bad or unfinished work. A few commenters added that different people may need different balances of planning and action, and that not everyone is helped by the same advice.

Overall, most people saw value in the idea: to make something real, you must start, accept being imperfect, and keep going. The message to "do and learn" felt true to many readers, even if the details of how to apply it can change for each person.

## Show HN: AirBending – hand gesture based macOS app MIDI controller

- 原文链接: [Show HN: AirBending – hand gesture based macOS app MIDI controller](https://www.nanassound.com/products/software/airbending)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44467279)

AirBending is a new macOS app that lets you control music software and hardware using just your hand gestures. It works as a MIDI controller, so you can use it with popular music programs like Ableton Live, Logic Pro, and many others.

You do not need any special drivers or plugins—just connect AirBending, and it speaks the same language as other music tools (MIDI). The app lets you set up custom presets, meaning you can decide which gestures do what. You can use one hand or two hands, and move them in different directions to control music.

You can choose which MIDI channel to use, so you can send commands to different music devices at once. AirBending also helps with pitch control: you can lock your gestures to a musical scale and key, so the notes you play are always in tune. This is helpful for both beginners and pros.

The app lets you assign hand movements to different control numbers (CC), which means you can change things like volume, filters, effects, or any other setting on your synthesizer or music software. This gives you a lot of freedom to make music in a new, expressive way.

Commenters on Hacker News had mixed reactions. Some were excited about using hand gestures for music, saying it looks fun and creative, especially for live shows. Others wondered how well the gesture detection works—will it be accurate or laggy? A few people liked that you do not need extra hardware, just your Mac.

Some users shared stories about trying similar tools in the past, like using Leap Motion or other motion sensors, but pointed out that software support and reliability were often problems. A few were worried about hand fatigue after waving your arms for a long time. Some asked about privacy—does the app record your camera?

Others thought it could be useful for people with disabilities, giving new ways to make music. One user wanted to know if it could also control lighting or visual effects in a performance. Some praised the easy setup, while others hoped for a Windows version in the future. Overall, many agreed that AirBending is a cool idea, but they want to see real-world demos before deciding if it’s useful for them.
