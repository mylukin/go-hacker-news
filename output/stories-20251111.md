## Collaboration sucks

- 原文链接: [Collaboration sucks](https://newsletter.posthog.com/p/collaboration-sucks)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45892394)

The article argues that too much collaboration at work slows people down and hurts productivity. It uses the example of driving a car: a little help is good, but too much input makes you stop and never reach your goal.

The author says many startups, including his company PostHog, start to add more and more collaboration as they grow. People want to be helpful, so they offer feedback all the time. But this means people spend too much time talking, asking for others’ opinions, and waiting for approval, instead of just doing their jobs. At PostHog, they try to avoid this by hiring skilled people and letting them act as “drivers.” They want people to work alone as much as possible, make decisions themselves, and only ask for feedback from specific people when it’s really needed.

The article gives examples of bad collaboration: asking everyone for input, not being clear about what feedback you want, and not knowing who owns what project. It says these habits lead to endless discussions, slow progress, and less motivation for the person doing the work. The writer suggests some solutions: default to shipping code or work first, then discuss changes later; speak up when too many people get involved; tag only the people you need; and let “drivers” make the final call. The main idea is that collaboration should not be the default—if you aren’t careful, you will collaborate too much and slow everything down.

In the comments, many people agree that too much collaboration can be harmful, especially in big companies where meetings and discussions never end. Some say they like working alone for focus and speed. Other commenters point out that good collaboration is still important for some tasks, like design or work that needs many skills. A few people say the problem is not collaboration itself, but bad management or unclear roles.

Some readers note that asking for feedback is sometimes just a way to avoid responsibility. Others think clear ownership and trust are the real keys to moving fast, not just avoiding collaboration. A few worry that no collaboration can lead to mistakes or missed ideas. Some mention that company culture matters—a team that talks a lot but never acts will always be slow. There are also stories about teams that went too far the other way, shipping bad work because no one talked to each other. In the end, most agree that finding the right balance is hard, but too much talk and too many opinions are a common problem in tech companies.

## A catalog of side effects

- 原文链接: [A catalog of side effects](https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiler-effects/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45891868)

This article talks about how compilers keep track of what each instruction changes in a program, called “side effects.” The main idea is that, instead of just asking what an instruction does, we should ask what it changes, like which part of memory it reads or writes.

Compilers use this information to decide if instructions can be moved, removed, or need to stay in order. If two instructions affect different things, the compiler can safely change their order. To do this, compilers need a way to record and check these effects. Some compilers, like Cinder, use something called a “bitset,” where each bit stands for a different memory area, like a list or a global variable. If two instructions affect different bits, they don’t interfere. Cinder uses this for things like removing dead code and making programs faster.

Other compilers, like JavaScriptCore (JSC), use something called “heap ranges.” This is like giving every memory area a number range, and if two ranges overlap, their instructions might affect each other. Heap ranges make it easier to handle lots of different memory areas, especially if there are more than a simple bitset can handle. JSC also uses these ranges when working with browser built-in functions, so the compiler knows what those functions change.

The article also mentions another project called Simple, which tracks effects using “alias classes.” This idea comes from research papers and is used to keep track of what kind of data each instruction touches. Other compilers, like HHVM, Android ART, .NET CoreCLR, and V8, mostly use bitsets too. Each project has its own way of recording effects, but the main goal is always to help the compiler make better choices and create faster programs.

In the comments, some people liked the clear explanation of bitsets and heap ranges. A few pointed out that bitsets are easy and fast but become hard to use if there are too many memory areas, while heap ranges are more flexible. Others said they enjoyed learning how different compilers solve the same problem in their own way. Some readers talked about the challenge of guessing when two memory areas can “alias,” or refer to the same place.

A few users shared stories about building their own compilers and how they started with the simplest method, marking every instruction as effectful, and then made things more precise later. Some commenters wondered if these ideas could be used in other kinds of programs, not just compilers. Others noted that the balance between being correct and being fast is always hard—over-approximating effects is safe but can block useful optimizations.

One person asked about the future: will heap ranges become more common as programs grow more complex? Another reader thought the examples helped make a tough subject easier to understand. There were also some technical discussions about the details of how JavaScriptCore works and how it tracks side effects. A few people linked to related papers or other compilers for anyone who wanted to read more. Overall, the comments showed that many readers found the post helpful, thought-provoking, and a good guide for anyone working on compilers.

- 原文链接: [A modern 35mm film scanner for home](https://www.soke.engineering/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45891907)

This article talks about Knokke, a new 35mm film scanner made for people who care about speed, quality, and control. It aims to modernize film scanning by using up-to-date hardware, software, and design.

Knokke can scan a full roll of 35mm film in under five minutes at a very high resolution of 4064 DPI and in 48-bit color. It uses a special lens and a modern sensor, which together give sharp images and strong color accuracy. The scanner supports a wide dynamic range, which means it captures lots of detail in both bright and dark areas of a photo. The built-in software, called Korova, is open source and works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. This means users do not need old computers or drivers to use it. You can set custom scan settings for each frame, skip to any frame quickly, and the scanner reads film codes to save metadata like film type and ISO. It creates many file types, including RAW, TIFF, JPEG, and more, with large file sizes for best quality. The device connects via USB-C, is compact, and weighs about 1.4 kg. Knokke does not support 120 film at launch, but this might come later. The scanner is easy to repair, has open schematics and manuals, and is made to last many years. The launch price is 999€, with a later retail price of 1599€. The team will share sample scans and is planning a Kickstarter in early 2026.

In the comments, some users are excited about a new, fast, and open-source film scanner. They like that it works on modern computers and is repairable. Others worry about the price, saying it is higher than some camera-scanning setups or older used scanners. Some ask for more details on real scan quality, comparing it to well-known lab scanners like Fuji Frontier and Noritsu. A few people want to know if it will support more film types in the future, especially 120 film. There is praise for the open approach and long-term support. Some worry about Kickstarter risks or delays. Others discuss if having high resolution really matters for all users, or if smaller, cheaper scanners are good enough. There are also technical talks about the sensor and lens choices, and questions about how good the software will be. Overall, people are interested and hopeful, but want to see real-world results and a fair price before buying.

## X5.1 solar flare, G4 geomagnetic storm watch

- 原文链接: [X5.1 solar flare, G4 geomagnetic storm watch](https://www.spaceweatherlive.com/en/news/view/593/20251111-x5-1-solar-flare-g4-geomagnetic-storm-watch.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45893004)

A very strong solar flare called X5.1 just happened on the Sun, coming from sunspot 4274. This flare sent out a big cloud of plasma toward Earth, called a coronal mass ejection (CME), and scientists expect it to hit us soon. The US weather agency NOAA gave a G4 geomagnetic storm warning, which means a strong magnetic storm could happen on Earth in the next day. This storm might make auroras (northern lights) show up much farther south than usual, maybe as far as northern France, Germany, or even Nevada and Arkansas in the US. The article also says two smaller CMEs are already on their way and could hit first, making the situation more complex. If the solar wind conditions are right, we might see a lot of auroras, but nothing is guaranteed. The article reminds people to check real-time data and use mobile apps for alerts.

The article also mentions that this is the sixth biggest flare in the current solar cycle and gives some history about past flares on this day. There is also a note about minor radio and satellite problems that could happen in polar regions due to the solar radiation. The website team encourages readers to ask questions if they don’t understand the science and offers links to help pages and forums.

People in the comments are excited about the chance to see auroras in places where they are rare. Some say they will stay up late or travel just to try to see the lights. Others are worried about the effects on satellites, GPS, and radio, especially for airplanes flying over the poles. A few mention that strong storms like this can sometimes cause problems for electric grids, but most think it will be fine. Some commenters point out that space weather is always hard to predict, so we should not be surprised if nothing big happens. A few share tips on how to get alerts or take photos of auroras. Others remember past solar storms and share their experiences. Some people joke about “end of the world” fears, but most are just interested in the science and beauty of these events. A few wish for more public awareness about space weather, since it can affect so much technology.

## My fan worked fine, so I gave it WiFi

- 原文链接: [My fan worked fine, so I gave it WiFi](https://ellis.codes/blog/my-fan-worked-fine-so-i-gave-it-wi-fi/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45830178)

The article is about someone adding WiFi control to a normal fan, even though the fan already worked well. The writer wanted to control the fan’s speed and power from anywhere, not just by touching the fan.

First, the fan was chosen because it used a DC motor, which is quiet and uses less power. The writer had already used a smart plug to turn the fan on and off remotely, but could not change the speed without walking over to it. After opening up the fan, they found a simple circuit with a potentiometer to control speed. They learned that changing the resistance on this potentiometer changed the fan’s speed.

To make the fan smart, the writer used a digital potentiometer, called a digipot, so the fan’s speed could be changed by a computer. They used an ESP32 chip and wrote special code to talk to the digipot. After proving the idea worked on a breadboard, they designed a custom printed circuit board (PCB) to fit inside the fan. They spent time picking the right parts, making sure everything would fit and work safely. The design kept the fan looking normal from the outside and made sure it could be undone if needed.

The new controls included a rotary knob for manual speed changes, and an RGB LED to show the fan’s status. The WiFi chip lets the fan be controlled by phone or computer. They chose the ESP32-C6 chip because it can use WiFi now, and other smart home networks later. The writer ordered the PCB from a factory, soldered on a few parts, and set up the software using ESPHome. The final setup means you can turn the fan on, off, or change its speed in person or over WiFi, and the lights give feedback.

In the Hacker News comments, many people said the project looked fun and well done. Some liked that the change was fully reversible and did not damage the fan. Others joked about smart devices being added to simple things, but agreed this was a good example of a smart upgrade. Some worried about security, saying WiFi in home devices can be risky if not done right. A few readers were impressed by the care put into the design, from reading datasheets to making the controls easy for users.

Some commenters asked about power use and whether the added parts made the fan less energy efficient. Others wondered if the project was worth the effort, but many said it was a great learning experience and a cool way to control an everyday object. There were suggestions for extra features, like adding temperature sensors or voice control. A few people shared their own projects, like making smart lights or heaters. Overall, readers enjoyed seeing the process and the result, and some said they wanted to try something similar at home.

## The Terminal of the Future

- 原文链接: [The Terminal of the Future](https://jyn.dev/the-terminal-of-the-future)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45892191)

This article talks about how today’s computer terminal is old and hard to change, because of design decisions made many years ago. It explains how a terminal works in four parts: the emulator (which shows the text), the PTY (which connects programs), the shell (like bash, which runs commands), and the programs you run inside.

The article says that terminals handle more than just text—they also deal with signals and special codes for color and formatting. The author dreams of a “terminal of the future” that is much better, taking ideas from tools like Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter lets you do things a normal terminal can’t, like show images, re-run commands, and edit output, but it has problems with interacting with long-running or interactive programs.

The writer points out that tools like Warp and iTerm2 already bring some modern features, such as showing command progress and letting you jump between commands. For running or managing long-lived processes, tools like tmux, mosh, and dtach let you disconnect and reconnect to sessions, but each has trade-offs and can add bugs or complexity.

The article also dreams of better undo/redo, smarter search, and features like collaborative editing, safer “sandbox” sessions, and full history tracking, much like a notebook or a spreadsheet. The big challenge is how to build all this in a way people can slowly start using it without needing to change everything at once. The author suggests starting with small command-line tools that add features, then later building more advanced stuff like persistent sessions, logs, and finally a whole new terminal interface.

In the Hacker News comments, many people agree the terminal is outdated and messy, but they also say it’s hard to replace because so many tools, habits, and scripts depend on it. Some users like the idea of “notebook” features but worry about security and breaking old scripts. Others point out that new terminals like Warp, Wezterm, and kitty are already trying to fix some problems, though not everyone likes their approach.

A few people worry about how much memory and CPU a fancy terminal might need, while others think the old text terminal will never fully go away because it’s simple and works everywhere, even on old or remote systems. Some commenters like the step-by-step plan for building new features, saying it’s smart to let users try things without switching everything at once.

There’s also debate about open source and making money from terminals—some say it’s very hard. A few point to Jupyter’s own problems, saying it’s not perfect for shell work. Some users mention they like how tmux lets them recover lost sessions, or how Mosh is great for bad network connections.

Finally, many agree that even if the “future terminal” is hard to build, it’s good to think about new ideas and slowly improve the tools we use every day.

## Scaling HNSWs

- 原文链接: [Scaling HNSWs](https://antirez.com/news/156)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45887466)

This article is about scaling HNSWs (Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds), a data structure for fast nearest neighbor search, and how the author added them to Redis. The author explains that HNSWs are powerful, but not perfect, and that making them fit well with Redis was a challenge.

The article is not an introduction; it shares advanced lessons from a year of developing HNSWs. The author talks about memory issues, since HNSWs use lots of pointers and can need a lot of RAM, especially for large vectors. One way to save space is quantization: using 8 bits instead of 32 for each vector component. This makes things 4 times smaller and almost as accurate, so it's the default in Redis Vector Sets. Full precision and binary quantization are also supported, but 8-bit is a good balance. The author explains the math and code tricks used to make quantization fast and easy.

For speed, HNSWs in Redis are fully threaded, using multiple CPU cores for both reading and writing. This is unusual for Redis, but HNSWs are slow and benefit from parallelism. The author shares details about marking visited nodes and handling concurrency safely, so multiple threads can work at once without bugs. Writes are split into two parts: a read-only phase and a commit phase, making locking easier and faster.

A big issue with HNSWs is deleting nodes and reclaiming memory. Many implementations just mark nodes as deleted, but in Redis, links are made bidirectional so when a node is deleted, all its links can be fixed. The leftover nodes are reconnected using a greedy algorithm to keep the graph working well, even after many deletions.

The author also explains why HNSWs in Redis are exposed directly as a data structure, not just as an index. This makes it easier for users to scale across many Redis instances, split data as needed, and even have separate small HNSWs per user or item. Loading times for big HNSWs are improved by serializing the graph structure on disk, making reloads 100x faster. The code also checks for data corruption and fixes links to keep things safe.

A new feature is filtering with JSON metadata, so you can do searches like "find similar movies from the 1980s." The author thinks this is better than mixing all data into one index and makes use cases simpler. Memory usage is discussed; loading 3 million word2vec entries uses about 3GB of RAM, which is acceptable for many real-world situations, especially with quantization.

In the comments, some readers praise the technical depth and the "brain dump" style of the post. Others are happy to see Redis keep pushing into new areas, especially with vector search becoming more popular. Some users are surprised by how much memory HNSWs need, but agree that quantization helps a lot. A few developers ask about disk-based HNSWs and share concerns about scaling beyond RAM, while others think the in-memory tradeoff is fine for most use cases. Commenters like the direct exposure of the data structure, saying it gives more power and flexibility to programmers. Some people wish for even more details about the JSON filtering and loading tricks. Others debate whether HNSWs are the last word in vector search, or if better data structures will come. A few share stories about fighting with other vector databases that are slower or harder to use. Some readers are excited to try Redis Vector Sets in their own projects, while others are curious if more advanced features, like better concurrency or even GPU support, might come in the future. Overall, the community sees this work as practical, open, and a good example for others building similar systems.

- 原文链接: [Meticulous (YC S21) is hiring to redefine software dev](https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/meticulous/3197ae3d-bb26-4750-9ed7-b830f640515e)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45892773)

Meticulous is a small startup in London that wants to speed up software development by building tools that can test frontend code automatically and very well. Their main product does not use popular AI models like LLMs or transformers, but something new and different, and they say no other company has built anything like it yet.

The team is only six people, but they have worked at big tech companies like Google, Uber, and Dropbox. Meticulous says their tool helps developers by running thousands of tests at the same time, giving quick feedback if something is broken. This helps developers know about problems right away and lets them improve their code faster. 

They also want to connect their tool to code-generating agents, so the agent can check if its code works and learn from mistakes. Their system tries to run tests that cover as many different code paths and edge cases as possible, making sure the tool is not just repeating the same checks. 

Meticulous says their customers, such as Dropbox and Lattice, pay a lot for the service and even suggest it to other companies. They think this kind of smart, automatic testing could help make software development much more automatic in the future. They offer high pay and a chance to work with top engineers and big names in tech.

In the Hacker News comments, some people are excited by the idea of automatic, complete testing. They say it could save lots of time and catch more bugs. Other commenters are curious about how Meticulous does this without using standard AI tools, and want to know more about their tech. Some users wonder if this tool would work well for very large or complex apps, or if it might miss some problems. A few are skeptical, saying past tools promised similar results but did not work as well in practice. Others say that even with good testing, developers still need to write good code and check design decisions. Some point out that joining such a small team could be risky, but the high pay and chance to work with famous investors may make it worth it. Overall, many developers are interested but want to see more proof that Meticulous really works as promised.

## Pikaday: A friendly guide to front-end date pickers

- 原文链接: [Pikaday: A friendly guide to front-end date pickers](https://pikaday.dbushell.com)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45887957)

This article talks about why most websites do not need a custom JavaScript date picker. The author says complex date pickers often confuse users and cause more mistakes on forms.

The article suggests using native date and time input fields in HTML because they are easy to use and work well in all modern browsers. Native inputs also help with accessibility, performance, and supporting different languages or regions. Browsers already have built-in calendar widgets, so developers do not need to make their own. For important dates, using separate inputs for day, month, and year—like the UK government website does—can be easier to use and prevents typing mistakes. When there are only a few valid choices, dropdown select menus are best. For times, dropdowns or radio buttons with fixed options (like every 15 minutes) are clear and simple. A single masked input field for dates, with helpful hints and client-side checks, is another good choice, but the article warns that updating these fields with JavaScript can sometimes cause problems with undo and redo.

The article also explains that date range pickers (for picking two dates) are usually hard to use. Instead, it’s better to have two simple date fields or a list of choices with radio buttons. For developers using frameworks like React, the article says it’s fine to use native HTML inputs instead of making custom components. Styling native date pickers is limited, but this is good because users are already used to their system’s look. The author advises against using custom JavaScript date pickers just because someone asks—remind them that simple, working forms should be the main goal. Accessibility is important, so developers should follow web standards, use browser tools to check, and test with real users. The article warns that accessibility overlays are not helpful and can make things worse.

There are also links to more resources about making date pickers accessible and designing simple forms. Finally, the author does not recommend any specific JavaScript date picker library, saying that every project is different and the simplest solution is usually best.

In the comments, many people agree that custom date pickers are often overused and cause more harm than good. Some developers share stories about users struggling with complex calendar widgets, especially on mobile devices. Others say that native date inputs sometimes have problems too, especially with different browsers or for users in countries with different date formats. A few people point out that for some special cases—like booking flights or hotels—a calendar view is helpful, but only if it is well designed and easy to use. Some commenters suggest that developers should always test forms with real users, not just rely on what looks good in code. There are also warnings that accessibility is hard to get right, and custom solutions almost always have bugs. One person says they still have to use a JavaScript library sometimes, but they try to keep it simple and only use it when the native input is not enough. Others mention that stakeholders or managers often ask for fancy date pickers without thinking about the user, so developers need to push back and explain the problems. Some commenters like the guide’s clear advice and wish more projects would use these simple ideas. Overall, the discussion shows that while developers like cool UI features, real users just want forms that are easy to fill out and do not get in the way.

## A unique collection of laptops adorned with creative stickers

- 原文链接: [A unique collection of laptops adorned with creative stickers](https://stickertop.art/main/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45789674)

This article shows a big online gallery of laptops covered with creative stickers from all over the world. The main idea is to celebrate how people use stickers to make their laptops unique and personal.

The project collects many photos, each showing a laptop’s top covered in stickers. Some laptops have just a few stickers, while others are completely covered, also known as “sticker bombing.” The stickers can show favorite tech companies, open source projects, games, bands, or funny art. Each laptop tells a little story about its owner—what they like, what they support, or what makes them smile. The photos come from many places, so you see different styles and types of stickers. Some are neat and organized, while others look random and wild. The website wants people to enjoy seeing how different personal choices look side by side. It also makes you think about your own laptop and what your stickers might say about you. The project is open for anyone to join; you can send in your own laptop sticker photos. The author hopes this will grow into a big collection that shows the creative side of the tech world.

In the Hacker News comments, some people say they love seeing so much personality and creativity. They remember their own old laptops and the stories behind each sticker. Others talk about how stickers can be a fun way to start a conversation at work or at events. A few warn that too many stickers might hurt the laptop’s resale value, or that some companies do not allow stickers on work laptops. Some people like to keep their machines plain and clean, saying they do not want to stand out or damage the case. Others joke about special tools to remove sticky glue, or share tips for putting on stickers neatly. One person points out that stickers can help you find your laptop in a crowd. There are also comments about how stickers can build community, like showing support for open source projects. Some users ask where to find good quality stickers, while others offer to swap stickers with anyone interested. A few wish the site had more background stories for each laptop, not just photos. In the end, most agree it is a fun and inspiring project that shows tech is not just about code—it is also about people and their stories.
