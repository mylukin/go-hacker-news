## Cowork: Claude Code for the rest of your work

- 原文链接: [Cowork: Claude Code for the rest of your work](https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46593022)

The article talks about Cowork, a new feature in Claude for Mac that lets you use the Claude AI to help with more than just coding. Cowork is now in a research preview for users with the Claude Max plan, and it aims to help anyone (not just developers) get work done faster and easier.

Cowork works by letting Claude access a folder on your computer. With this access, Claude can read, edit, and create files for you. For example, it can tidy up your downloads, make a spreadsheet from screenshots, or write a first draft using your notes. Cowork is different from chatting with Claude because it acts more like an assistant: you give it tasks, and it works through them, keeping you updated as it goes. You can also add more power by using connectors (to get outside info) and skills (to help with making documents or presentations). It even works with Claude in Chrome, so it can do things on the web.

Cowork is made to keep things simple. You don’t have to keep giving extra info or fix the results by hand. You can line up several jobs for Claude, and it will do them one by one. It feels more like working with a real coworker than just talking to a chatbot.

You stay in control of what Claude can see and do. You pick the folders and connections it can use, and Claude asks before making big changes. But there are risks. Claude could delete files if you’re not careful, and there’s a risk of “prompt injection,” where someone tries to trick Claude with bad instructions from the web. Anthropic (the company) says they have safety systems, but users should be careful and start slow.

The team wants feedback from users and plans to improve Cowork, including adding support for Windows and new safety features.

In the Hacker News comments, some people are excited about Cowork and say it could save time on boring tasks. Others worry about giving an AI access to their files, fearing mistakes or security problems. A few users point out the risks of prompt injection and wonder if the safety steps are good enough. Some developers like that Cowork can be used for non-coding tasks, saying it makes AI more useful for everyone. Others want to see cross-platform support, not just Mac. There are also questions about the price, with some saying the Max plan is too expensive for casual users. One user says having Claude as a coworker could help people who work alone feel less isolated. Some are interested in how Cowork handles privacy and whether it will be audited. Others point out that similar products have failed in the past because of trust issues, so Cowork will need to prove itself. Overall, people are both interested and cautious, waiting to see how well Cowork works in real life.

## TimeCapsuleLLM: LLM trained only on data from 1800-1875

- 原文链接: [TimeCapsuleLLM: LLM trained only on data from 1800-1875](https://github.com/haykgrigo3/TimeCapsuleLLM)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46590280)

This article is about TimeCapsuleLLM, a language model trained only on texts from London between 1800 and 1875. The goal is to create an AI that truly uses only historical knowledge and language, not modern ideas or words.

The project started with small models, first using about 187MB of old books and writings. Early versions showed the AI using old-fashioned sentences, though sometimes the text did not make sense. Later versions, trained on more data, became better at writing in a Victorian style, using correct punctuation and grammar. Still, the model often made up facts, and some errors from old scans appeared in its answers.

By version 1, the model could connect historical events and people from that time, showing some understanding of real history from the period. The biggest version so far was trained on 15GB of texts. There were still some technical issues, like the way words were split up, but the model sounded more realistic and stayed in the mindset of the 1800s. The full dataset is 90GB but not fully used yet.

To build TimeCapsuleLLM, the creator collected old books, newspapers, and legal documents, cleaned the text, made a custom tokenizer, and trained the model from scratch. This is different from fine-tuning a modern AI, because those would still “remember” modern things. Here, the model only “knows” what people knew in 1800-1875 London. The creator used different computers and rented GPUs for the bigger versions.

In the Hacker News comments, some people found this project very interesting and saw value for historians and writers. They liked the idea of removing modern bias and thought it could help create better historical fiction or even help understand how people thought back then. Others pointed out that texts from the 1800s already had their own biases, so the model could only reflect those, not avoid bias altogether. A few users were curious how much the model really “understands” or just copies old text, and some noticed the technical issues, like OCR errors, affecting the output.

There were also comments asking about the size of the dataset, if bigger models could work better, and how the model deals with things people in the 1800s would not know. Some worried that only using London texts left out other cultures and ideas from the same time. Others suggested the same idea could be used for other places and times, to build AIs that “think” like people from those eras. Finally, some users wondered if this approach could help teach history in schools, by letting students “talk” with an AI from the past.

## Postal Arbitrage

- 原文链接: [Postal Arbitrage](https://walzr.com/postal-arbitrage)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46591708)

The article talks about how mailing a letter now costs $0.78 in the US, but you can buy small items on Amazon for less—and they ship for free. The author found many cheap products, like Kool-Aid, a potato, or a can of tomato sauce, all under the cost of a postage stamp.

Instead of sending a postcard, you can buy these items and add a free gift note. Your friend gets something fun or useful, and it arrives fast. The author lists examples like a lime for $0.25, ramen for $0.47, or even a hurricane tie for $0.51. In 2023, the author sent $1 cans of beans to family members. This started a lively group chat, with everyone sharing photos of their beans. Soon, the family began sending other random things to each other—cookies, sardines, even a pregnancy test as a joke. The main idea is: sending a real item can be cheaper and more memorable than sending a letter.

In the comments, some people think this is a clever hack and very funny. They like the idea of surprising friends with odd gifts for less than a stamp. Others wonder if Amazon can keep shipping so cheap, or if this could hurt their business. Some worry it’s wasteful or bad for the environment, since it means more packaging and delivery trucks. A few mention that Amazon might stop allowing this if too many people do it. Some users point out that it’s a good reminder of how strange shipping economics are in the US. Others joke about sending potatoes or random parts to friends just for fun. Several say this is a creative way to connect with people, and they might try it. A few people are surprised Amazon even sells single lemons or packets of Kool-Aid so cheaply. One commenter warns that some sellers might cancel super-cheap orders, but others say they have tried it and it works. Overall, the discussion is full of jokes, ideas, and questions about how long this trick will last.

## The chess bot on Delta Air Lines will destroy you (2024) [video]

- 原文链接: [The chess bot on Delta Air Lines will destroy you (2024) [video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0mLhHDcY3I)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46593395)

The video is about a person trying to beat the chess bot on Delta Air Lines during a flight and finding out it is very hard to win. The creator then tests how strong the Delta chess bot is by playing it against different chess.com bots.

The main idea is that the Delta chess bot is much stronger than most people expect. Even players who are pretty good at chess, with ratings around 1750 or even 2000, say they get beaten by the bot. The video shows that the bot does not make simple mistakes and always tries to win, unlike some modern bots that play weaker on purpose to match your level. The Delta bot seems like it uses an old chess engine, which just calculates the best moves and does not let the player win easily. The creator tries different ways to beat it, but fails again and again, showing how tough the bot is. Many people who fly with Delta and play chess on the plane have the same experience: they get crushed by the bot, even after many tries. Some people get so frustrated that they stop playing and watch movies instead.

In the comments, many viewers share their own stories about losing badly to the Delta chess bot, some even writing to Delta to complain about how hard it is. One person jokes that the bot’s easy mode is harder than they expected, and wonders what a hard mode would be like. Another says the programmer who made the bot must be laughing at everyone struggling. There are funny comments, like saying if you beat the bot, you should get to fly the plane, or that the first-class bot is much easier so rich people can feel good. A few people with high ratings (near 2000) say they still win only one out of four or five games, and only when they keep the board “closed” with more pieces. Some wish Delta would invite a chess grandmaster to play against the bot for a real test. Others joke about how it’s not fair to give bored passengers a game they can never win. Overall, people find the bot both annoying and funny, and agree it is much harder than most chess bots you find for free.

## Fabrice Bellard's TS Zip (2024)

- 原文链接: [Fabrice Bellard's TS Zip (2024)](https://www.bellard.org/ts_zip/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46593802)

Fabrice Bellard’s new tool, ts_zip, uses a large language model to compress text files much more than normal tools like xz. It only works well for text, needs a GPU, and is slower than standard compressors—up to 1 MB per second on a top-end GPU. The tool uses the RWKV 169M v4 model, which is trained mostly on English but can also handle other languages and even code. ts_zip predicts the next word or token in a file, then uses an arithmetic coder to store the data more efficiently. The model runs the same way every time, so files can be decompressed on any computer with the right software.

Looking at the numbers, ts_zip can shrink files much smaller than xz. For example, a 1 GB English text file is compressed from about 213 MB (with xz) to only 135 MB with ts_zip. But, it’s experimental, so file formats may change and might not be backward compatible. There’s also a special tool, ts_sms, for compressing small messages.

In the comment section, many people are impressed by the compression results. Some note how amazing it is that language models can do better than classic algorithms, especially for plain text. Others point out that the speed and hardware requirements make ts_zip less useful for everyday use right now. A few are worried that frequent updates could break compatibility, so compressed files might not be safe for long-term storage. Some highlight that this approach could help with special cases, like compressing code or logs, while others wonder if similar ideas could work for images or audio. A couple of users mention the model’s focus on English and question how well it works on other languages. There is also praise for Fabrice Bellard’s history of building great software tools. Finally, some suggest this could lead to new ways of compressing data as models improve in the future.

## Unauthenticated remote code execution in OpenCode

- 原文链接: [Unauthenticated remote code execution in OpenCode](https://cy.md/opencode-rce/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46581095)

This article explains a big security problem in OpenCode, an open-source AI coding tool. Before version 1.1.10, OpenCode would start a web server on your computer without telling you, and anyone could use it to run code on your machine.

The server had no password or protection. If OpenCode was running, any website could send commands to it and make your computer do things, even without your permission. For example, a website could tell OpenCode to run a shell command or read files on your computer. This was possible because of a loose CORS policy that let any site from opencode.ai or its subdomains talk to your OpenCode server.

After version 1.1.10, the server is off by default, but if you turn it on, it is still not protected by a password. There is also no clear sign that the server is running, so users might not know they are at risk. The article gives proof-of-concept commands showing how easy it was to abuse this. It lists which versions are affected, what is fixed, and what is not. Some problems are still not fixed, like when the server is enabled, any local process or any website from localhost can run commands as you.

For safety, the article says to update OpenCode, check your settings, don’t use the --mdns flag, and be careful about visiting opencode.ai if the server is running. It also points out that the company did not respond to early reports of the problem, and some fixes were made quietly without telling users. The writer suggests more improvements: add authentication to the server, show a warning when it’s running, improve documentation, and secure the network connections.

In the Hacker News comments, many people are surprised by how serious this security hole is. Some say it is unacceptable for any app to start an open server with no password, especially a developer tool. Others note that silent fixes without public notices make things worse because users may not know they are at risk. A few mention that this kind of mistake is common in new open-source projects, but it is very dangerous when the software can run code.

Some users talk about the importance of good defaults—servers should never be open by default. Others say that even with the server off by default, it should never be possible to turn it on without authentication. There is also discussion about how long it took for the developers to react to the problem, and that the security email was not checked. A few users worry that similar problems might exist in other AI or developer tools and ask for better security processes in open-source projects. Some point out that CORS is not real security, and that relying on it is a bad idea. A handful of commenters say this case shows why you should always check which network services your software starts.

## Date is out, Temporal is in

- 原文链接: [Date is out, Temporal is in](https://piccalil.li/blog/date-is-out-and-temporal-is-in/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46589658)

This article talks about how JavaScript’s old Date object is confusing and hard to use, and how a new thing called Temporal will make working with dates much better. The author explains that Date has lots of problems, like strange rules about months and years, weird ways of parsing dates, trouble with time zones, and the fact that it lets you change a date by accident.

The article gives many code examples to show how Date works in surprising ways. For example, months are counted from zero, so “1” means February, not January. If you give Date a string like "49" or "99," it guesses a year, sometimes 1900s and sometimes 2000s, but then "100" means year 100. Even formatting the date as "2026-01-02" or "2026/01/02" can give different answers. The author says Date is an object, not a value, so if you change it in one place, it changes everywhere, which can lead to bugs in your code.

Temporal is different. It is a namespace object, not a constructor, so you don’t use “new Temporal()”. Instead, you use methods like Temporal.Now.plainDateISO() to get today’s date. Temporal gives you clear names and ways to work with dates, times, time zones, and durations. When you add a day to a date with Temporal, it makes a new date, so your old date stays the same. This helps prevent mistakes from changing the wrong date by accident.

The author shows how Temporal makes code shorter and easier to understand. For example, adding a day to today is just today.add({ days: 1 }) and does not change today. With Temporal, you are less likely to get the wrong date or time, and you can handle time zones more easily. Temporal is not finished yet, but it is in new versions of Chrome and Firefox, so you can start testing it.

In the comment section, some people are very happy to see Temporal coming, saying that Date has caused them lots of trouble over the years, especially with time zones and daylight saving time. Others point out that using libraries like Moment.js or date-fns was the only way to avoid Date’s problems before, but now maybe we won’t need extra libraries. A few commenters say that Temporal is still complex and that date handling will always be tricky because time is hard to model in computers. Some worry about browser support and how long it will take before everyone can use Temporal safely. There are also people who are unsure if Temporal’s API is really easier, but most agree it is a big step forward. One person warns that even Temporal can’t fix every problem, because some things like leap seconds are still very hard. Overall, the comments show hope that Temporal will make date and time work much better in JavaScript.

## LLVM: The bad parts

- 原文链接: [LLVM: The bad parts](https://www.npopov.com/2026/01/11/LLVM-The-bad-parts.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46588837)

This article talks about problems in the LLVM project, a big open-source toolchain used for building compilers. The author is the lead maintainer and wants to show areas where LLVM can improve, not reasons to stop using it.

One big problem is that there are many people making changes, but not enough experts to review all the new code. This can slow things down and sometimes lets mistakes into the project. New contributors also struggle to find out who should review their code. The author suggests using a system like Rust’s, where pull requests get assigned to reviewers automatically.

LLVM’s internal code and interfaces change often. This is good for fixing mistakes, but bad because it causes trouble for people building on top of LLVM—they must keep updating their code. Building LLVM takes a long time, especially on slow computers, and things get worse with debug builds. Some solutions, like pre-compiled headers and better linking, help speed things up.

Continuous integration (CI) is flaky—tests often fail for reasons unrelated to code changes. This makes it hard to spot real problems. There’s also a lack of “end-to-end” tests, so some bugs slip through if different compiler parts interact badly.

The backends (parts of LLVM that generate code for different CPUs) are very different and often only get fixes for their main users, leading to duplication and gaps. Compile times are still slow, especially for unoptimized code. There’s no good, official way to track performance changes, so it’s hard to see if changes make things faster or slower.

Some design issues in LLVM’s intermediate representation (IR) make optimization and reasoning hard. For example, “undef” values are confusing and can block optimizations. There are also old bugs that are hard to fix because it would require big changes. Encoding constraints (like “this value is positive”) is tricky, and floating-point math is handled in complex, sometimes messy ways.

Other problems include long migrations to new systems (like the pass manager and instruction selector), confusing handling of calling conventions and built-in functions, and a weird split between “context” and “module” in the code. Some optimizations, like moving code out of loops, can cause performance issues, but the system doesn’t always fix them after.

In the comments, many readers agree with the author, saying they have faced the same issues—like slow builds and tricky reviews. Some users defend LLVM, saying it’s hard to keep a big project stable while also improving. Others think the review bottleneck is the biggest blocker and support the idea of automatic reviewer assignment. A few suggest that more paid maintainers or company support could help. Some people complain that the documentation is lacking, especially for ABI and calling conventions, making it tough for new users. Others discuss how the fast pace of internal change is both a strength and a weakness—good for progress, bad for downstream projects. There’s debate about testing; some want more end-to-end tests, while others think unit tests are enough for a project of this size. Several mention slow compile times as a big frustration, especially for small changes and hobby projects. Some users share their own workarounds for build and test pain points, while a few suggest looking at lessons from other projects like Rust. Overall, people respect LLVM’s power but agree there’s room for improvement, especially in making it easier for new developers and downstream users.

## Show HN: AI in SolidWorks

- 原文链接: [Show HN: AI in SolidWorks](https://www.trylad.com)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46591100)

This post is about LAD, an AI helper that works inside SolidWorks, a popular software for 3D design. LAD lets you control SolidWorks using plain English, making it easier to design things without knowing all the commands.

With LAD, you can describe what you want to build, and the AI translates your words into actions in SolidWorks. For example, you can ask it to create a new sketch or add a feature, and it will do it for you. LAD also checks if the steps were done right, looking at screenshots and the feature list, and fixes mistakes if needed. You can give it images or documents from old projects, and it will read and use them to help make new designs. If you need special functions, LAD can write and run custom macros, searching SolidWorks’ help files for the right code. There are safety tools too: you can save checkpoints, go back to old versions, and control which commands the AI can run. Recent updates added a planning mode, better macro tools, and smarter error checking.

People in the comments had many thoughts about LAD. Some users were excited and said this could save a lot of time, especially for beginners who find SolidWorks hard to learn. Others were worried that AI might make mistakes or do things wrong, and that you still need to understand how SolidWorks works to catch problems. A few developers liked the idea of using natural language but wondered how well LAD understands complex or unusual requests. Some wanted to know about privacy and if the AI sends their designs to the cloud. There were questions about pricing and if there’s a free version to try. A few users pointed out that SolidWorks already has some automation tools, but LAD might make things even easier for non-experts. Others warned that relying too much on AI could make people forget how to use SolidWorks the “manual” way. Overall, the community was interested, but they wanted to see real examples and hear from people who use LAD in real projects.

## Floppy disks turn out to be the greatest TV remote for kids

- 原文链接: [Floppy disks turn out to be the greatest TV remote for kids](https://blog.smartere.dk/2026/01/floppy-disks-the-best-tv-remote-for-kids/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46587934)

This article is about a parent who made a special TV remote for his 3-year-old son using real floppy disks. He wanted his child to have a simple, hands-on way to pick and play TV shows or music, instead of using confusing modern remotes or apps.

The parent noticed that most smart TVs are hard for children. Kids often need help from adults, and then they get stuck watching whatever auto-plays next. He wanted his son to feel in control and to learn cause and effect—if you break a disk, it stops working. Floppy disks were chosen because they are physical, make fun sounds, and are easy to understand.

At first, he thought about putting RFID tags inside floppy disks, but taking apart and rebuilding the disks was tricky. Instead, he used the floppy disk’s real data storage ability. He put a small file on each disk that tells the TV what to play. To make this work, he used Arduino boards to read the floppy and another board for WiFi. He also solved technical problems like powering the drive with batteries and making sure the device sleeps when not used.

He built a system where putting in a disk sends a "play" command to a Chromecast, and taking it out sends a "pause" command. Each disk can have its own label, so the child can pick what to watch or listen to. The box holding everything was made from laser-cut wood. He even fixed a problem where the floppy disk could get damaged if left inside, by moving the read head away after use.

In the end, his son enjoyed using the floppy disks to start and stop shows. Sometimes disks got damaged, but that was part of the learning. The project uses both old and new tech, mixing nostalgia with modern streaming.

In the comments, one person said the project seemed like a lot of work just to avoid interacting with his child. They worried that technology might take the place of real parenting, and said it’s important to spend time with kids and teach them patience and other values. Another commenter liked the idea and said they wanted to do something similar with mini disks. They also asked if using just an RFID tag inside the disk would make everything simpler and use less power.

Some readers think this is a fun, creative solution that makes technology more physical and understandable for kids. Others worry about the use of technology to replace personal attention or family time. There is also discussion about different ways to build the project, with some people suggesting easier or more efficient methods. Overall, most people seem to enjoy the idea and respect the technical work, even if they have different opinions about the parenting side.
