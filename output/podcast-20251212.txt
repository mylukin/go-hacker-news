Hello everyone, this is the 2025-12-12 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we bring you a mix of stories about open source fonts, AI on the Mac, security in business software, creative experiments, new tools for databases, a high-paying engineering job, teaching AI in schools, and a major math breakthrough.

Let’s start with GNU Unifont. Unifont is a free font that tries to cover every character in the Unicode standard, so people everywhere can read and write in their own language. It’s part of the GNU project and gets regular updates, thanks to many volunteers who help draw and improve the small images, or glyphs, for every letter and symbol. The main release covers the Basic Multilingual Plane—about 65,000 Unicode points—and even goes beyond, covering rare scripts and extra symbols. Unifont is available in many formats, like OpenType and BDF, and there are special versions for Japanese, APL, and more. Because of its open licenses, you can use Unifont in commercial projects, but you must share your changes and credit the original authors.

Unifont has some limits. It only stores one glyph per code point, so scripts where letters change shape, like Arabic or many Indian scripts, do not look good. For these, Unifont is only a last-resort font. Volunteers are always needed to draw missing glyphs, but should check first to avoid duplicate work. Recent updates improved Chinese character shapes, added emoji, and fixed glyphs for Arabic and CJK scripts. Users can see what’s covered using tables and charts on the website.

On Hacker News, people praise Unifont for its huge coverage and usefulness, especially for showing rare or missing characters in apps and terminals. Some say it looks “ugly” because it’s pixel-based, but others like that it just works everywhere and is easy to use in technical or embedded settings. There are some problems with complex scripts, so users recommend other fonts for good-looking text in those languages. Many are happy about the open licenses, while a few wish it was even easier to change. Several people thank the volunteers for their hard work, and some share tips for installing Unifont or editing glyphs.

Next, Apple’s new macOS 26.2 update brings support for fast, low-latency AI clusters using RDMA over Thunderbolt. This means Macs with Thunderbolt 5 can connect and share data quickly for distributed AI tasks, making big AI models easier to run on Mac hardware. The update also fixes bugs with AirDrop, Swift memory tracking, and iCloud in virtual machines. A new StoreKit feature helps developers check app age ratings, and some test subscription bugs are fixed. Most of the update is about smoother performance for developers and users.

Hacker News commenters are excited about the RDMA feature. Many think it will make small, fast AI clusters easier and cheaper, especially for researchers and indie hackers. Some wonder how easy it will be to use, and if Apple will release tools or hardware for clusters. There are worries about setup, drivers, and documentation. Others debate if this can match big cloud AI clusters, since Thunderbolt cables are short and you can only connect a few Macs. Still, many see it as a big technical step for Mac users.

Now let’s talk about security problems with electronic invoices in the EU. These invoices use a special XML format, and the main issue is that the technology is not always safe. The EU wants standardized, machine-readable invoices, but there are too many formats and sub-formats. The XML format can have security flaws, especially XXE (XML External Entity) vulnerabilities, which can let attackers read files or steal data. Some languages and libraries are safe by default, but others, like Java and the Saxon library, are not unless you change settings.

XSLT 2.0 is used to check if invoices follow EU rules, but only the Saxon tool supports it, and it’s not secure by default. Many people using official tools might be open to XXE attacks without knowing. It’s also hard to get the full set of invoice rules—some parts are free, some are not. The article’s author tested popular tools and found security holes in almost all. Some companies fixed problems quickly, others did not.

In the comments, people agree that XML is risky and too complex for invoices. Some blame developers for not using safe settings. Others hate that official rules cost money. There are worries about relying on one tool, and some think simpler standards would be better. Many want free, easy-to-use testing tools from the EU. Some are frustrated that basic XML security mistakes still happen, and say open bug reports and fast fixes are important to keep everyone safe.

Switching gears, there’s a fun story about a group building a VR system so real rats can play DOOM. They made a special machine with a treadmill ball, curved screen, sensors, and a reward system that gives sugar water for good behavior. The first version was simple, but the new one is much better, with a wrap-around screen and smarter rewards. The rat walks on the ball to move in the game, pulls a lever to shoot, and gets sugar water as a prize. Air puffs and sound make the game more real for the rat. The designs and code are open source, and the system uses Python, a PC, and a Raspberry Pi. Training the rats takes a few weeks, but the team’s rats got too old before full testing, so they still need more data. The system needs manual setup for each rat.

Commenters found the project funny and impressive, and liked that it’s open source. Some worry about the rats’ well-being and asked if VR is stressful for animals. Others see research potential for studying how brains learn in virtual worlds. There’s talk about the ethics of making animals play games, and jokes about rats speedrunning DOOM. Overall, the project sparked curiosity and some deep questions about technology and animals.

On to databases: there’s a cool trick for working with JSON data in SQLite. You can store JSON, use virtual generated columns, and add indexes for faster queries. The main idea is to keep your JSON as-is, use SQLite’s JSON functions to pull out values into virtual columns, and add indexes. This way, you get the flexibility of JSON and the speed of indexed databases. If you need to search by a new field, just add another virtual column and index—no need to change the whole table.

Many commenters were surprised SQLite could do this. Some think it’s a smart way to get both flexibility and speed. Others warn that if your JSON changes too much, things can get messy. People share their own stories of using SQLite’s JSON features, and agree it’s a useful pattern for moving quickly and keeping things simple.

Now, a playful programming story: a developer tried to check if a number is even or odd using only “if” statements, not the usual math. He started with a small C program, then used Python to generate thousands of “if” statements in C, covering all 8-bit and 16-bit numbers. For 32-bit numbers, the generated code was too big for the compiler, so he wrote the logic in machine code and ran it from C. After fixing a bug with big numbers, the program worked and was fast, but the file was over 40 GB.

Hacker News users found the article funny and liked the “what if” approach. Some joked about the waste of space and time, and pointed out that real solutions are simple and fast. Others liked the use of code generation, and talked about technical limits like file size. Some said it’s a good lesson about time-memory tradeoffs, but mostly saw it as a fun experiment that shows the importance of using the right tool for the job.

In database news, there’s a new extension called pg_clickhouse that lets you run ClickHouse queries directly from PostgreSQL. As companies grow, they often move analytics data from PostgreSQL to ClickHouse, but changing all the old SQL queries is hard. Pg_clickhouse solves this by letting you point old queries at ClickHouse tables, so they run faster without rewriting. It uses the foreign data wrapper system and supports advanced “pushdown,” which means most of the work happens in ClickHouse, not PostgreSQL. The team saw big speedups in tests and plans to support more query types soon.

On Hacker News, users are excited and call it a “game changer” for analytics migrations. Some ask about compatibility and performance, and others worry about keeping up with changes in both databases. There are requests for more documentation and real-world examples, but overall, people see pg_clickhouse as a helpful tool for teams with growing data.

Next, Motion is a tech company building a work platform powered by AI agents, and they’re hiring for a Senior Staff Frontend Engineer. The role is focused on rebuilding the frontend as the product grows from a small app to a big business tool. Motion’s AI agents can finish tasks for users, not just give advice. The company has grown fast and has strong investor backing. The new engineer will help add offline support, faster syncing, and micro frontends, and will shape how the app works for years. The pay is very high, with salaries up to $375,000 and total compensation close to $1 million. The job is remote for North America and Canada, with visa sponsorship.

Hacker News commenters are surprised by the high salary and ask about the workload and work-life balance. Some think working on deep technical changes is exciting and will attract top talent. Others wonder if the company’s “intense” culture means long hours or high stress. There’s interest in how the AI agents work and if the fast growth is sustainable. Some say the job is great for those who want to learn quickly, but the high standards are not for everyone. Many agree the engineering problems are interesting, and that visa sponsorship is a big plus.

Now, an article about teaching AI to students using secondary school maths. Researchers from Austria and Germany made workshops that use AI examples in maths classes to help students understand what AI really is. Students learn about decision trees, regression, and neural networks, using real-world problems like traffic lights and Netflix recommendations. The key message is that AI is just maths—it finds patterns, but doesn’t think or understand like humans. The workshops use Jupyter notebooks, so students don’t need to code, and teachers guide them step by step.

On Hacker News, people agree that it’s important for kids to learn AI is just maths and statistics, and not magic. Some say teaching the limits of AI is good, but students should also learn what AI can do well. Others worry that focusing only on maths might make students miss the bigger picture of how AI changes society. There are tips about hands-on demos, and some say even adults need to learn that AI doesn’t “think.” But some warn not to make students believe AI is useless, since it can still surprise us with what it can do.

Finally, a big story in mathematics: a group of mathematicians say they have solved a major problem in algebraic geometry using ideas from string theory, a branch of physics. The proof tries to show which kinds of polynomial equations can be “parameterized” (easily solved) and which cannot. For decades, the question was open for degree-3 polynomials with five variables. The team used ideas from mirror symmetry in string theory to break the problem into smaller pieces and proved that these equations cannot always be simplified.

Many mathematicians are trying to understand the proof, which uses new and unfamiliar tools from physics. Some trust the famous mathematician, Maxim Kontsevich, who led the work, while others are cautious and want to see more traditional explanations. There’s excitement about new ways to do math, but also a desire for simpler proofs. Overall, the result has restarted interest in the field and made people hopeful for future discoveries.

That’s all for today’s episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Thank you for listening, and we’ll see you next time.
