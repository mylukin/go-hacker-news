## Meta Superintelligence's surprising first paper

- 原文链接: [Meta Superintelligence's surprising first paper](https://paddedinputs.substack.com/p/meta-superintelligences-surprising)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45553577)

Meta’s new Superintelligence lab released its first research paper, and it focused on making Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems much faster and cheaper. This was surprising because most people expected the lab to first tackle fundamental AI model improvements, not practical application optimizations.

The paper introduces "REFRAG," a new way to improve RAG. In standard RAG, you have a big knowledge base. When a user asks something, the system finds relevant pieces (chunks) from documents, then sends them as full text to a large language model (LLM) to help answer the question. This process is slow and expensive, especially for apps that need fast answers or handle lots of users.

REFRAG changes this by turning most document chunks into short, dense "embeddings"—special vectors the LLM can use directly, instead of full text. Only a few of the most important chunks are turned back into full text, chosen by a lightweight policy trained with reinforcement learning. This saves a lot of memory and computing power, giving up to 30 times faster first answers without losing accuracy.

The main idea is that if the LLM can understand embeddings, there’s no need to convert everything back to plain text, which is wasteful. This approach is more efficient, increases how many users one system can handle, and reduces costs.

The paper argues that while big leaps in AI often come from larger, smarter models, there’s also huge value in making current systems run more efficiently. For companies using RAG for AI search, chatbots, or customer support, these changes could mean better performance without buying more hardware.

Some challenges remain. Training the system is more complex, since it needs a special encoder and a trained policy to pick which chunks to expand. If you compress information too much, answer quality drops. Precomputed embeddings only work well with data that doesn’t change often; fresh data is harder to handle. Also, for high-precision tasks like legal or medical answers, heavy compression might be risky.

Hacker News commenters had mixed feelings about REFRAG. Some were impressed by the real-world focus, saying this is a smart way to cut costs and speed up AI apps without waiting for better models. Others worried about the complexity it adds—now there’s more to build, train, and debug. A few said that the biggest gains in AI still come from improving the core models, and that optimizations like this are just short-term wins.

Some users also discussed trade-offs: while embeddings save resources, they can miss small details needed for exact answers. Others pointed out that similar ideas have been tried before, but Meta’s scale and attention might finally make it mainstream. There was also some skepticism—people want to see open-source code and real benchmarks before getting too excited. Lastly, a few wondered if this would make vector databases more or less important, and if it signals a trend toward more practical AI research, not just chasing bigger, smarter models.

## Show HN: rift – a tiling window manager for macOS

- 原文链接: [Show HN: rift – a tiling window manager for macOS](https://github.com/acsandmann/rift)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45553995)

This post is about Rift, a new tiling window manager for macOS made to improve how you use many windows on your computer. Rift wants to be fast, easy to use, and work well with macOS features.

The main features of Rift are different window layouts, like i3 and bspwm styles, so you can arrange windows how you like. There’s a menubar icon that shows all your workspaces and layouts, so you can quickly see what’s open. It also has a mission control view, letting you move between workspaces visually, much like the native macOS mission control. Rift supports “focus follows mouse,” so when you move your pointer, the window under it becomes active. You can drag windows on top of each other to swap their places, which is helpful for organizing your space. Rift uses smooth animations, so moving things around looks nice. You can change workspaces with trackpad gestures, just like in macOS. The configuration can be reloaded without restarting Rift. It can also work with other programs, like Sketchybar, using a command-line tool or a Lua client. Rift does not need you to disable System Integrity Protection (SIP), which makes it safer. It works even if you have “Displays have separate Spaces” turned on, something other window managers might not support.

Rift is still in development, but people say it is stable for daily use. The creator was inspired by other tools like Aerospace but wanted better animations and fullscreen support on multiple displays. Rift uses some private macOS APIs, which can be faster and more reliable. The project started as a fork of glide-wm but is now very different. It is written in Rust.

In the comments, some users are excited to see a tiling window manager that does not need SIP to be turned off. Others like that Rift works with “Displays have separate Spaces,” since this is a problem with other managers. Some people ask how Rift compares to yabai, another popular manager, and wonder if using private APIs might break in future macOS updates. There are users who are happy to see features like focus-follows-mouse and workspace gestures. A few developers are curious about how hard it is to set up and if it works with all apps or just some. One user mentions that Rift’s animations look good and make the workspace feel modern. Others point out that being able to reload the config file without restarting is a nice touch. Some people share concerns about stability because it is still in development, but others say it works well for them so far. A few users express thanks for open source work on macOS, saying there are not enough good choices for window managers. Some suggest more documentation or videos to help new users. Overall, the community seems interested and hopeful about Rift’s progress.

## Vancouver Stock Exchange: Scam capital of the world (1989) [pdf]

- 原文链接: [Vancouver Stock Exchange: Scam capital of the world (1989) [pdf]](https://scamcouver.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/scam-capital.pdf)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45553783)

The article talks about the Vancouver Stock Exchange (VSE) in the late 1980s and how it became famous for scams and fraud. It explains how many companies listed on the VSE were not real businesses but were set up to cheat investors.

The article describes how small mining and tech companies joined the VSE, promising big profits from gold, diamonds, or new technology. Most of these companies never made money or even produced anything. Some companies used fake reports or paid fake experts to make their projects look good. The VSE rules were loose, so it was easy for dishonest people to list companies, sell shares, and then disappear with the money. Many investors lost all their savings because they trusted these fake companies.

The article also explains that some brokers and lawyers helped the scams by writing good reports or helping to hide the truth. Regulators often failed to stop the scams because they did not have enough staff or power. The VSE wanted to look successful, so they did not do enough checks. Some people even said the VSE was the easiest place in the world to run a stock scam. The article gives examples of companies that took millions from investors and then vanished. The problem was so big that the VSE got a bad name around the world.

In the Hacker News comments, some people say this story is a warning about what happens when there are few rules and little checking. Others think the problem is not just in Vancouver; scams can happen anywhere if people are too greedy or rules are weak. A few commenters share stories about losing money in similar scams or watching friends lose everything. Some say that regulators have learned from the past, but others argue that new scams still happen, just in different ways, like with cryptocurrency. There are also people who think the VSE had some real, honest companies, but they were outnumbered by the bad ones. Some users talk about how easy it is to trick people when there is hope of getting rich quick. Others point out that strong rules can help, but no system is perfect. Finally, a few suggest that people need to be careful and not trust everything they hear, especially when it sounds too good to be true.

## China's New Rare Earth and Magnet Restrictions Threaten US Defense Supply Chains

- 原文链接: [China's New Rare Earth and Magnet Restrictions Threaten US Defense Supply Chains](https://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-new-rare-earth-and-magnet-restrictions-threaten-us-defense-supply-chains)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45554369)

China just announced new rules making it much harder to export rare earth elements and magnets, which are important materials for making many high-tech products. These new restrictions come before a big meeting between U.S. and Chinese leaders and are seen as a way for China to gain more power in talks.

The new rules use something called the foreign direct product rule, which is usually used by the U.S. to control tech exports, but now China is using it for rare earths. This means any company, from any country, must get Chinese approval to export magnets if they contain even a small amount of Chinese rare earths or use Chinese technology. Even products made outside China can be affected if they use anything from China in their process.

China is the main global supplier of rare earths, doing most of the mining, processing, and magnet making. This is a big problem for the U.S. defense industry, which needs rare earths for jets, submarines, missiles, and radar systems. The U.S. already has trouble making enough of these products, while China is building up its military much faster. With these new rules, getting rare earths for U.S. defense will be even harder, because China will almost always say no to any military use.

The new rules also mean Chinese experts cannot help with rare earth projects in other countries unless the Chinese government says yes. China wants to keep its special knowledge and technology from leaving the country. The article says these export controls are also a way for China to get a better deal in talks with the U.S.

China has made similar moves before, like banning rare earth processing technology exports and limiting some rare earth shipments after U.S. tariffs. Sometimes, temporary deals were made, but often China delayed exports or changed the rules, causing problems for U.S. companies. These actions show China is using rare earths as a way to push for what it wants in trade and politics.

To fight back, the U.S. is trying to build its own rare earth and magnet supply chain. Only one company, Noveon Magnetics, makes these magnets in the U.S. The government is spending a lot of money to help companies like MP Materials and Lynas Rare Earths grow, build new factories, and process more rare earths in America. But this will take time, and for now, China still controls most of the supply.

Hacker News users had many thoughts about this news. Some users said it shows why it is risky for one country to control so much of a key resource. Others pointed out that the U.S. and other countries ignored building up their own rare earth industries for years, making it easy for China to take the lead.

Some commenters argued that the U.S. should have seen this coming and started working on its own supply chains much earlier. They talked about how rare earth mining is messy and expensive, which is why many countries let China handle it. Others said the U.S. government spending money on new factories is a good start but might not be enough.

A few users doubted the U.S. could catch up quickly, since it takes years to build mines and factories and train workers. Others wondered if new technology could reduce the need for rare earths or if recycling could help. Some people saw the move as a warning that global supply chains are fragile, and countries need to think about security, not just price.

There was also debate about whether China's restrictions would hurt China’s own economy by losing foreign sales, or if it would mostly hurt the West. Some said both sides will lose, but the U.S. might suffer more in the short term. Finally, a few commenters worried that this could lead to more trade fights and make the world less connected and more divided.

## Is Odin just a more boring C?

- 原文链接: [Is Odin just a more boring C?](https://dayvster.com/blog/is-odin-just-a-more-boring-c/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45551995)

This article talks about the Odin programming language and asks if it is just “a more boring C.” The writer tries Odin by building a small key-value store with a pub/sub feature, something useful for learning a new language.

First, the writer explains they have a strong background in systems programming (like C, C++, and Zig), and wanted to see if Odin is good for more than only game development. They say game programming needs speed, control, and reliability, so a language for games can also be good for other system tools or desktop apps. To test Odin, they wrote a simple key-value store with pub/sub. The code is basic, but it touches on memory management, data structures, concurrency, and networking.

In Odin, you manage memory yourself. You use `make` to create slices (like arrays) and maps (like dictionaries), but you must free them later for long-running programs. Odin makes this easier than C by having a `delete` function, but you still need to be careful. The writer adds cleanup code to show how to free memory properly. Next, they add concurrency using threads, so each pub/sub handler runs in its own thread. To avoid problems when multiple threads access shared data, they use a mutex (a lock) around the key-value store.

Odin’s concurrency tools feel like C’s `pthreads` but are simpler to use. The code compiles very fast—about 0.4 seconds for the small project. Error messages are clear but sometimes too long, especially when one mistake causes many errors. Odin’s syntax is like C, but with some changes: pointers use `^` instead of `*`, and you write `proc` for functions. The writer finds this strange at first, but gets used to it.

Odin has a strong standard library with many data structures and utilities. It also comes with "vendor" libraries for graphics, games, and windowing (like SDL2, OpenGL, Vulkan), so you can start building desktop apps or games fast. C interop is easy, so you can use C libraries if you need something not built-in. Some parts are missing, like a package manager, and some advanced data structures, but overall, it is easy to write your own or find third-party code.

The writer says Odin feels “boring” in a good way: simple, clear, and not trying to be too clever. It is like Go, but without a garbage collector, making it better for some low-level work. Odin is a good fit for game development, systems programming, and desktop apps. It is not yet great for web development, but maybe that will change.

In the Hacker News comments, people have different views. Some say Odin is nice and easy to read, and they enjoy the fast compile times. Others think it is too similar to C or Go, and does not solve new problems. A few like Odin’s “boring” style and say it helps them focus on solving problems, not fighting with complex language features. Some users complain about the pointer syntax (`^`) and missing package manager, saying these are small but annoying. Others mention that the good C interop and built-in libraries make Odin a strong choice for quick projects. Some worry that the language is still young and might not have enough third-party libraries or a big community yet. A few comments ask if Odin will stay simple as it grows, or if more features will make it harder to learn. Overall, many agree that Odin is fun to try, is fast to compile, and could be useful for certain projects, especially games or tools that do not need a garbage collector.

## Heroin Addicts Often Seem Normal

- 原文链接: [Heroin Addicts Often Seem Normal](https://justismills.substack.com/p/heroin-addicts-often-seem-normal)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45553296)

This article talks about how heroin addicts often look and act like normal people, not just the people you see struggling on the street. The writer shares personal stories about living with two people addicted to opiates, saying they were good roommates who did their chores and acted normal most of the time.

One roommate had a drug problem that was hard to notice. He had friends, a job, and played video games. The other roommate was a bit more obvious—he sometimes had shady guests and once passed out outside, but it still didn’t seem like a big crisis. The author says they only learned how bad things were after the roommate moved out and later died from addiction.

The writer explains that addiction can hit anyone, not just people who look unstable or homeless. Some addicts recover and live normal lives; others don’t make it. The writer saw both outcomes among friends. They also say that in big cities, people often think of addicts as only beggars or people with big mental problems, but this isn’t the full picture.

The article ends by saying that drug addiction is complicated. There are different types of addicts, some very functional and some not. Any good policy must remember both groups, not just focus on the most visible cases.

In the comment section, some people agree and say they also know addicts who seem normal and keep jobs. They share stories about friends or family who hid their problems well. Others think the article is important because it shows why we should not judge people just by how they look.

A few commenters talk about how hard it is to spot addiction, even for close friends or family. Some say that good addicts can hide their problems for years. Others discuss the idea from the start of the article about giving drugs safely to addicts but are unsure if it would help.

One person mentions that drug addiction can happen to anyone, not just people in bad situations. Others point out that recovery is possible, but it’s often random who gets better and who does not. Some feel sad about the stories of people who died, while others feel hopeful about those who recovered.

A few commenters discuss how society should help addicts. Some support more treatment options, while others worry about enabling addiction. Many agree that we need to look beyond stereotypes and try to understand the real problem.

## My First Murder

- 原文链接: [My First Murder](https://www.texasmonthly.com/true-crime/skip-hollandsworth-new-book-she-kills/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45490980)

This article is about a writer’s memory of a shocking murder-suicide in his hometown of Wichita Falls, Texas, in 1974. He was a teenager when a rich oilman and his wife, Bobby and Abbie Burns, were found dead in their mansion.

The story begins with the writer, Skip Hollandsworth, describing his normal, quiet life and how the news of the murders shocked the whole town. The Burns family was famous and lived in a big house with many security features, but none of it stopped the tragedy. At first, everyone thought it was a break-in or maybe a planned attack by someone outside. But after a few days, the police announced it was likely a murder-suicide. Abbie, the wife, was said to have shot her husband and then herself.

Skip found it hard to believe. Abbie had a glamorous life, nice cars, and was known as kind and talented. He started his own small investigation, asking adults for rumors and even visiting the mansion, but no one knew the real story. The police closed the case quickly, and the family stayed silent. The town was left with only rumors, like Bobby having an affair or Abbie wanting to avoid shame. None of these rumors were ever proven.

This event deeply affected Skip. He became interested in crime stories and later made a career as a journalist, writing about real murders and mysteries, especially those involving women. He spent years trying to understand the Burns case, reading old reports and talking to people who knew the family, but the truth was never found.

In the end, even after returning to Wichita Falls many years later, Skip realized the story would always be a mystery. The deaths of Bobby and Abbie Burns haunted him and shaped his work, but he had to accept he might never know what really happened.

People in the Hacker News comments shared many different ideas. Some readers focused on how real-life mysteries are often left unsolved, unlike in fiction. Others said the article showed how rumors can fill the gaps when facts are missing, and how small towns keep secrets. A few readers wondered if the police really did a good job or if they closed the case too quickly. Some discussed how big events like this can shape a young person’s life and career choices. Others compared the article’s storytelling style to true crime books and podcasts they enjoy. There were comments about how wealth and status do not protect people from tragedy. Some readers felt sad that the family and community never got closure. Others liked how the writer was honest about not having all the answers. A few users shared their own stories of mysteries in their hometowns. Some thought the article was a good reminder of how complex people’s lives can be, even if they look perfect from the outside. Others mentioned how gossip and imagination take over when the truth is hidden. There was also talk about the importance of careful reporting in true crime stories. Some readers praised the writer’s style, saying it made them feel part of the story.

## Microsoft only lets you opt out of AI photo scanning 3x a year

- 原文链接: [Microsoft only lets you opt out of AI photo scanning 3x a year](https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/25/10/11/0238213/microsofts-onedrive-begins-testing-face-recognizing-ai-for-photos-for-some-preview-users)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45551504)

Microsoft is testing a new face-recognizing AI for photos in OneDrive, but users can only turn off this feature three times per year. Some users found the setting hard to change, and Microsoft did not give clear answers about why this limit exists or when the feature will fully launch.

The article explains that Microsoft is rolling out this AI feature to a small group of users as a preview. When a user uploads a photo, OneDrive may analyze it using AI to find faces. If you try to turn off the face-recognition setting, you are warned you can only do so three times a year. Sometimes, trying to switch it off does not work at all, with an error message popping up. Microsoft says that privacy is important and claims to follow privacy laws like GDPR. However, they would not answer why the three-times-a-year rule exists or give a real date for when the feature will be fully available. Privacy experts told the reporter that privacy features like this should be opt-in, not opt-out, and users should be able to change settings whenever they want. The article also notes that Microsoft links to a support page that has said “coming soon” for almost two years.

Many comments on Hacker News are upset or joke about Microsoft’s decision. Some say they do not use Microsoft products for reasons just like this. Others suggest using encrypted storage or avoiding cloud photo services. One user points out that maybe the three-times rule is for technical reasons—turning face recognition on and off could use a lot of computer power because it must re-scan all photos. But most people think the rule is silly or only helps Microsoft, not users. Some compare this to other companies, like Amazon Photos, that also use face recognition, but say the difference is that Microsoft makes it harder to turn off. A few are worried about privacy for people who do not understand tech and cannot protect their data. There are also jokes that Microsoft will just turn the setting back on with every update. Some users are angry at being forced into features they do not want, and several say that Microsoft’s answers to the reporter’s questions were not helpful at all. One user warns that Microsoft might scan photos anyway, no matter what the setting says. Overall, the community sees this as another example of big tech making choices for users and not respecting privacy.

## LineageOS 23

- 原文链接: [LineageOS 23](https://lineageos.org/Changelog-30/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45553835)

LineageOS 23 is the newest version of this popular custom Android OS, now based on Android 16. The article explains how the team updated LineageOS to this new Android version, even while Google’s update process has become more complex.

Google now releases security patches and feature updates in larger chunks, called QPRs (Quarterly Platform Releases), instead of making everything public every month. Some important updates, like QPR1, are not yet open-source, so LineageOS 23.0 uses the initial Android 16 release (QPR0) and will add new features later. Security patches might lag, but the LineageOS team will only update the security patch level when all fixes are public.

Support is harder for Google Pixel devices since Google stopped sharing full source code for them. Now, Pixel phones are not easier to support than other brands. Also, because Android 16 needs new kernel features, some old phones with very old Linux kernels (like 4.4 or 4.9) can’t run LineageOS 23 unless someone backports those features.

Despite these challenges, there are many improvements. The camera app (Aperture) was rebuilt and now supports new photo formats. The music app (Twelve) got extra features like a random play button and better stats. There’s a new TV launcher called Catapult that removes ads and gives users more control. Virtual machine support (using QEMU and Cuttlefish) is better, so developers can run LineageOS in VMs more easily. More devices can now use the mainline Linux kernel, making it easier to keep them running with future updates.

LineageOS is almost free of old Android.mk build files, moving to the new soong build system. Charging and fast charge features were improved. There are new ringtones and alarms from Plasma Mobile. The download portal and wiki are improved, making it easier to find and install the right files. Many new devices are now officially supported, and developers are encouraged to submit more.

In the Hacker News comments, many users thank the LineageOS team for their hard work and dedication, especially since Google’s update process is now less open. Some worry that Google holding back source code will harm the whole Android community and make it harder for custom ROMs to keep up. Others say this change may push more people to open-source projects. A few users discuss the technical challenges of supporting old devices and are sad that some phones will lose support unless volunteers step up.

Many are excited about the new features, especially the rewritten camera app and better VM support. Some developers are impressed with how quickly LineageOS moved to Android 16, given all the roadblocks. There are questions about whether mainline kernel support will make it easier to run Android on more hardware, with some hoping this could keep old phones alive longer.

A few users note that LineageOS still depends on Google’s code for some things, so the project’s future is tied to how open Google stays. Others mention that while custom ROMs are great for privacy and updates, installing them is still too hard for many regular users. Overall, most commenters are happy LineageOS is moving forward and hope the project keeps growing despite the changes from Google.

## Google blocks Android hack that let Pixel users enable VoLTE anywhere

- 原文链接: [Google blocks Android hack that let Pixel users enable VoLTE anywhere](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-ims-broken-october-update-3606444/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45553764)

Google has stopped a hack that let Pixel phone users turn on VoLTE, a calling feature, in places where it was not allowed. The article explains that some people used a special app to change hidden settings and get VoLTE working, even if their phone company did not support it for their device.

The hack worked on Pixel phones because Google left some settings open. Users could unlock "carrier config" options with a tool called Shizuku, which lets apps change deep system settings. This was useful for people traveling or using smaller phone companies, because VoLTE can give better call quality and sometimes is the only way to make calls on modern networks. The hack became popular after some networks started blocking old calling methods and required VoLTE. People liked that they could use their Pixel phones fully, even with companies that did not officially support every feature.

However, Google decided this was a security risk. They released a software update that closed the loophole, so these hidden settings can no longer be changed by normal users or apps. The article says this is disappointing for power users, but Google’s main reason is to keep phones safe from malware or bad apps that could abuse these settings. Now, only phone companies and Google can control VoLTE options on Pixel phones.

In the comment section, some users are unhappy with Google’s decision. They say it takes away control from users who want to use all their phone’s features, especially if their network is slow to update. Others agree with Google, saying that leaving deep system settings open could be dangerous and could help hackers or malware. Some users point out that other phone makers like Samsung already block these settings, so Google is just catching up. A few commenters suggest that Google should let advanced users unlock these options if they really want, maybe with warnings. Others note that this change may hurt people in countries where phone companies do not support VoLTE well. There are also jokes about how modern phones are more locked down than before, and some people miss the old days when they could tinker more freely. A few users wonder if there will be new workarounds in the future, or if people will switch to different phone brands because of this.
