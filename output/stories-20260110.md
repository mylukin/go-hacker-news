## Open Chaos: A self-evolving open-source project

- 原文链接: [Open Chaos: A self-evolving open-source project](https://www.openchaos.dev/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46566812)

OpenChaos.dev is a new open-source project that lets anyone suggest and vote on code changes. The project calls itself "self-evolving" because the community decides what gets added next, and merges happen based on votes, not just code quality.

The main idea is simple: there is a countdown timer, and when it ends, the most-voted pull request (PR) gets merged into the code. Anyone can open a PR. Some PRs add features, change designs, or even add silly things. For example, popular PRs include rewriting the project in Rust, making the site look like old GeoCities, or scrambling the content every 10 seconds. Others add fun things like a snow overlay, pointer effects, or a "Hall of Chaos" for past winners. Some PRs are technical, like showing the age of PRs, adding vote progress bars, or health indicators for PRs. There are even jokes, like always using light mode in dark mode, or adding a "dickbutt" meme. Every merge changes the project, sometimes in useful ways, sometimes just for fun. The project is always changing because new merges can undo or build on old changes.

In the comments, some people love the chaos and say it's a great experiment in community-driven software. They think it is fun to see what happens when everyone can vote, not just argue about code style. Others worry that the codebase will become messy or hard to use if silly changes keep winning. There are jokes about how fast the project will break or become useless. Some users compare it to other chaotic or crowd-driven projects, like "Twitch Plays Pokémon," and say this is a creative way to learn about open-source teamwork. A few developers talk about technical problems, like merge conflicts or security. Others wonder if this could work for more serious projects, or if it only makes sense for fun, throwaway sites. Many agree it is interesting to watch, even if they would not use the code for anything important. Some suggest adding limits or moderation, while others say the chaos is the whole point. In the end, most agree that OpenChaos.dev is a playful, new way to think about open-source, and it is fun just to see what the internet does with it.

## Show HN: I used Claude Code to discover connections between 100 books

- 原文链接: [Show HN: I used Claude Code to discover connections between 100 books](https://trails.pieterma.es/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46567400)

This article shows a project called Trails, where the author used Claude Code (an AI tool) to find connections between 100 different books. The website links ideas from many books and groups them by themes, so you can see how certain concepts appear again and again.

Each theme, or "trail", collects book summaries and shows their common ideas. For example, there are trails about self-deception ("Useful Lies"), about how groups share knowledge ("Collective Brain"), and about why projects fail ("Unreliable Parts"). Some trails talk about innovation through copying ("Ideas Mate"), or how isolation can help new ideas grow ("Tinkering Sanctuary"). Other trails show big patterns, like how winners keep winning ("Winner's Lock"), or how making things simple can help or hurt ("Simplification Trap"). There are also technical topics, like how systems fail through small cracks ("Invisible Crack"), and how precise measurements build trust in trade ("Measuring Trust").

The author explains that Claude Code read the book texts and used its AI to suggest these connections. The result is a map of ideas, not just book summaries. This can help people who want to see how themes and lessons from one book repeat in others.

In the comment section, some people are impressed by how the tool helps with "syntopic reading"—finding links across many books. Others say it’s a nice way to discover new books and ideas. A few users wonder about the quality of the AI’s summaries and if the links are always meaningful. One person asks if the author checked the AI’s work for mistakes or bias. Some wish the site had more books or let users add their own trails. A few mention that human curation might still be better for deep connections, but they like how fast AI can do the first pass. Others discuss if this method could be used for research or in schools. Some users are excited for more projects like this, mixing AI and books. Others think it’s a fun way to get book ideas without reading full reviews. Overall, people like the creative use of AI, but they see both strengths and limits in the results.

## Worst of Breed Software

- 原文链接: [Worst of Breed Software](https://worstofbreed.net/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46569749)

This article is about a website called "Worst of Breed," which makes fun of bad software and over-complicated tech projects. The site uses fake testimonials and silly examples to show how some teams choose complex, flashy solutions instead of simple ones.

The main idea is to joke about "resume-driven development," where engineers pick new tools and patterns just to look good on their resumes, not to solve real problems. Examples include using blockchain to store website cookies, splitting a small script into many microservices, and rewriting a simple web page in Rust just to say it's "web scale." The website lists fake "design patterns" that make software hard to maintain, like using a database for sending messages between systems or running six versions of React at once. They also highlight the industry’s love for trendy tools and complicated frameworks, even if they slow down the product or make it harder to work with.

The site’s "manifesto" says they value complexity more than simplicity, and tools more than real solutions, making fun of how some tech teams work. The whole website is a parody, using humor to point out common mistakes in modern software development.

In the Hacker News comments, some people laughed and said the jokes felt too real, sharing stories from their own jobs where similar things happened. A few said they have seen teams use Kubernetes or microservices for tiny apps, just to use new tech. Others noted that sometimes business or politics, not just developers, push for complex solutions. Some commenters argued that new tech can be good if used in the right place, but agreed that most projects start simple and should stay that way unless there’s a real need to scale. A few users worried that newcomers might not get the jokes and might copy these bad habits. Many liked the site’s humor and said it’s a good reminder to keep things simple and focus on real value, not just on fancy tools for your resume. Some wished there were more examples or stories, while others joked they had worked at companies just like the ones on the site. Overall, the comments showed both laughter and real concern about growing complexity in software.

## Finding and Fixing Ghostty's Largest Memory Leak

- 原文链接: [Finding and Fixing Ghostty's Largest Memory Leak](https://mitchellh.com/writing/ghostty-memory-leak-fix)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46568794)

Ghostty, a terminal emulator, had a big memory leak where it could use up to 37 GB of memory after running for several days. The issue was tricky to find but is now fixed and will be part of the next release. Ghostty uses a special memory system called PageList to manage the text and data in the terminal. This system uses standard-size memory pages from a pool for most work, which makes things fast. Sometimes, for special data like lots of emojis or links, it needs bigger, non-standard pages. These are created differently and must be deleted in a special way.

When the terminal has too much history (scrollback), Ghostty tries to reuse the oldest memory page to save time and resources. If the page is standard-sized, this works well. But if the page is non-standard, there was a bug: Ghostty only changed the page’s label to look standard but did not actually free the extra memory. Later, when the page was deleted, the program thought it was a standard page and skipped the needed delete command, which caused the memory to leak.

This problem only happened in rare situations, usually when certain command-line tools (like Claude Code) produced special outputs with complex characters. As more users started using these tools, the leak became much bigger and easier to notice.

To fix the bug, the developer changed the code so non-standard pages are never reused—they are always deleted properly. This fix is simple and fits with how Ghostty usually works. The developer also added better tools for checking memory usage on macOS, making it easier to spot and fix leaks in the future. Ghostty now also has a test to make sure this leak does not come back.

People on Hacker News had a lot to say. Some praised the clear write-up and the fix, saying it was a good example of careful debugging. Others pointed out that memory management is hard and bugs like this are common, even in well-tested code. A few users suggested more advanced memory tracking or smarter page pooling, but most agreed that keeping the fix simple was wise. Some developers shared stories about similar bugs in their projects, showing this is a common problem in programming. One person liked the use of macOS’s memory tagging, saying it helps a lot for debugging. Others said it’s important to have real-world tests, since this bug did not show up in normal unit tests. Finally, many thanked the community for reporting details and helping find the exact problem, showing the value of open-source teamwork.

## AI is a business model stress test

- 原文链接: [AI is a business model stress test](https://dri.es/ai-is-a-business-model-stress-test)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46567392)

This article talks about how new AI tools are making it hard for some software companies to make money, using Tailwind Labs as an example. Tailwind Labs had to lay off most of its engineers because fewer people are visiting their documentation since AI can now give answers and code directly.

The company used to earn money when developers visited their site, saw Tailwind Plus (a paid set of UI pieces), and bought it. But now, developers just ask AI for help and don’t need to visit the docs. This broke Tailwind’s sales method, even though their product is still popular. The article says AI didn’t destroy the business, but it showed the weaknesses in the business plan.

A big point is that AI can easily copy things that are clearly described, like documentation or code samples. AI was trained using Tailwind’s docs and can now give that info to users without sending them to Tailwind’s site. The writer thinks this is unfair, as AI companies don’t pay back the creators whose content they use.

The article explains that real value now comes from things you can't just write down or describe once. For example, running servers, keeping websites working, fixing problems, and keeping things secure—these need people to show up and do real work, not just write instructions. The author gives examples: Vercel gives away its code for free but makes money hosting apps; Acquia sells services around open source tools, not the tools themselves.

So, open source code is just a pathway to bigger services—real business is in operations. Some open source projects, like CSS tools, are harder to turn into strong businesses because AI can easily copy them.

In the Hacker News comments, many people agree that AI changes how people use documentation and code. Some say this is just the start, and more companies need to think about how to add value beyond simple code or docs. Others think it’s not fair for AI to use free content without giving anything back. Some commenters wonder if companies like Tailwind should focus more on things AI can’t do, such as support, training, or hosting.

A few people say open source was never a great business model for small tools, and AI just made the problem worse. Some worry that if AI keeps taking from open source projects without helping them, fewer people will want to share their work. Others think that open source will always find a way to survive, but companies need to adapt.

One commenter points out that companies who build their future only on visitors and paid add-ons are at risk now. Another says that, in the end, people pay for what is hard to automate, like keeping websites running smoothly. Some feel sad about the layoffs but hope Tailwind can find new ways to earn money. There’s hope that more open source businesses will still succeed, even if they need to change how they work.

## A Eulogy for Dark Sky, a Data Visualization Masterpiece (2023)

- 原文链接: [A Eulogy for Dark Sky, a Data Visualization Masterpiece (2023)](https://nightingaledvs.com/dark-sky-weather-data-viz/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46565132)

This article is about the end of the Dark Sky weather app and why many people thought it was special. Apple bought Dark Sky in 2020 and shut down the app in 2023, saying its technology would be added to Apple Weather, but users felt something important was lost.

Dark Sky was not just a weather app—it was praised for its great design and smart data visualization. The app made it very easy to understand weather information at a glance. For example, it always started showing weather from the current moment, so you didn’t have to see old data. It let you see the weather for your exact location, not just a whole city, and you could quickly spot when it would rain, how temperatures would change, or if you needed to watch out for storms. 

The app used simple and clear visuals, like arrows for wind direction, color scales for storms, and “temperature pills” that showed real temperature differences, not just rescaled bars. Sometimes, instead of showing exact numbers for rain or snow, it used rough categories like “light” or “heavy,” which was easier for most people to use. This helped people make quick decisions, like when to go outside or cover their furniture. The app was also context-aware: it showed the most important weather details for your needs at that time.

People who loved Dark Sky said the Apple Weather app is not as clear or helpful. Some said they missed the special graph showing when rain would start or stop, which helped them plan their day. Others felt Apple Weather required more effort to get the same information, or was missing useful details like cloud cover.

In the comment section, some users remembered how Dark Sky made weather data feel alive and easy to understand. They liked the focus on local, real-time information and the simple, friendly design. Many felt that other weather apps, even Apple Weather, are harder to use or less clear. Some people hope that, in the future, more apps will use design ideas from Dark Sky to make data more useful in daily life. Others pointed out that while data is everywhere now, not many apps use it in a way that really helps people. There was also talk about how hard it is to replace a tool that fits perfectly into daily routines. A few commenters noted that good data visualization can make a big difference for any app, not just weather. Some wondered if Apple will ever match Dark Sky’s level of detail, while others shared tips for finding other apps with similar features. Overall, people agreed that Dark Sky set a high bar for clear, helpful design.

## Rats caught on camera hunting flying bats

- 原文链接: [Rats caught on camera hunting flying bats](https://scienceclock.com/rats-caught-on-camera-hunting-flying-bats-for-the-first-time/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46568662)

Researchers in Germany have filmed brown rats catching flying bats in mid-air, something never seen before. The study took place in a limestone cave with thousands of bats, using cameras over several years.

The cameras showed rats balancing on cave ledges, waiting for bats to fly by, and then jumping to grab them from the air. In five weeks, the team saw 13 kills and even found a hidden pile of 52 bat bodies, proving the rats were true hunters, not just eating dead bats. This is new because brown rats usually eat slow or easy prey, not flying animals. The rats used two hunting styles: jumping to catch bats at the cave entrance and attacking bats crawling on the ground. Scientists think rats find the bats in the dark using their whiskers and hearing, not their eyes. This ability to change and learn new ways to hunt is called “behavioral plasticity.” The crowded cave and many bats made a perfect place for rats to learn this new skill.

This finding is worrying for bats, because rats are an invasive species and could hurt bat numbers, especially since bats already face other problems like disease and loss of habitat. The researchers say people might need to control rat numbers near big bat roosts to protect the bats. Still, the most amazing part is seeing a regular city rat acting like a skilled hunter, showing how animals can surprise us and adapt in ways we do not expect.

People in the comments had many reactions. Some were shocked that rats could catch flying bats and called it “nature is metal.” Others said rats are clever and will eat almost anything if given the chance. A few pointed out this shows how invasive rats can be a danger to native wildlife, not just in cities but also in natural places. Some readers worried this could make it even harder for bat populations to recover in Europe. Others joked about city rats learning “ninja moves” or said they now understood why rats are so successful around the world. A few commenters wondered if this behavior happens in other places but has not been caught on camera yet. Some discussed how smart and adaptable rats are, while others felt sad for the bats. One person noted that this is a good reminder of why humans should watch and study even common animals closely, because they can surprise us.

## ASCII-Driven Development

- 原文链接: [ASCII-Driven Development](https://medium.com/@calufa/ascii-driven-development-850f66661351)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46538628)

This article is about using ASCII art—simple text characters—to design user interfaces before making them in code or high-fidelity design tools. The writer explains how UI design tools have changed over the years from simple, rough sketches (like Balsamiq) to very polished tools (like Figma and even AI that builds the whole UI).

The author says that new AI tools can make beautiful UIs fast, but they often look finished before the structure is ready. This can slow teams down because people start arguing about small design details (like colors or shadows) too early, instead of focusing on the main structure or user flow.

To solve this, the author uses “ASCII-Driven Development.” With this, you draw wireframes and layouts using only keyboard characters. This keeps things simple and clear—no one can argue about colors, only about structure and ideas. ASCII designs are fast to make and easy for anyone on the team to change, even if they don’t use design tools.

The article gives many examples: dashboards, product pages, Kanban boards, checkouts, and mobile flows—all shown in ASCII. Each example shows how you can see the main structure, flow, and information hierarchy without worrying about fonts or images.

Another big idea is that AI language models are very good at making and changing ASCII layouts. You can talk to the AI, ask for small changes, and get new ASCII versions quickly. Once the layout looks good, you can send the ASCII to code-generating tools (like v0 or Lovable), and they will make real UI code.

ASCII layout also makes teamwork easier. Anyone can edit ASCII in a text file, on Slack, or in email. You don’t need special design software or skills. It’s easy to track changes with version control, and people can suggest edits or new ideas by just changing the ASCII text.

The article ends by saying ASCII-Driven Development helps teams move faster and focus on the important parts first: structure and flow. Only after the structure is right should you move to detailed design.

In the Hacker News comments, many people liked the idea. Some said ASCII reminds them of how they used to draw UIs on whiteboards or paper and that it keeps everyone focused on the big picture. Others pointed out that ASCII layouts are easy to share in code reviews or documentation.

A few commenters worried that ASCII is not great for very complex layouts, or that it’s hard for some people to “see” the final product just from text. Some said using ASCII may not work well for teams with less technical people or for projects needing lots of visuals.

Others shared that they already use similar low-fi methods (like drawing in Markdown or using simple boxes) and that it keeps meetings shorter and more productive. Some asked if there are tools to help convert ASCII directly to code or if there are best practices for making good ASCII layouts.

A few people said that, while ASCII is great for early ideas, you still need real design tools for final reviews. Some mentioned that ASCII can be a barrier if team members are not comfortable with it, but most agreed it’s easier than learning Figma or Sketch.

One commenter joked that maybe ASCII is the “universal design language” for developers because everyone understands it. Another said it helps keep design and development closer together, which is good for shipping products faster.

Overall, the comments showed interest in trying this method, especially for brainstorming and early planning. Many liked the idea that ASCII keeps the process open, fast, and focused on structure before getting lost in the details.

## ChatGPT Health is a marketplace, guess who is the product?

- 原文链接: [ChatGPT Health is a marketplace, guess who is the product?](https://consciousdigital.org/chatgpt-health-is-a-marketplace-guess-who-is-the-product/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46541533)

ChatGPT Health is a new product from OpenAI that helps people manage health questions and connects to their medical records and wellness apps. The article says OpenAI is making a big deal about privacy, but in the past, they have not protected user privacy very well.

The writer explains that on most ChatGPT plans, privacy is not automatic—you have to pay more for better data protection. With ChatGPT Health, OpenAI claims strong privacy, but the writer is suspicious. OpenAI is losing a lot of money and needs to make more, so the author thinks they are collecting health data to sell services, not just to help people.

ChatGPT Health links with apps like Peloton and Apple Health, and it uses a company called b.well to connect to your medical records. b.well mainly works for insurance companies, not for regular people. Their goal is to help insurers know more about you before you even make a claim. This means ChatGPT Health is not only giving advice, but also building a big system where insurers, wellness brands, and healthcare providers can reach users directly. Your health data becomes a product that others can buy or use.

There’s another problem: US law called HIPAA protects your health data at the doctor’s office, but not when you give it to a tech company like OpenAI. This means OpenAI can set its own privacy rules, and these can change any time. Also, ChatGPT Health is not available in the EU, UK, or Switzerland, which have strong privacy laws—suggesting OpenAI’s privacy promises might not hold up under strict rules.

In short, the article warns: OpenAI says you are the customer, but really, your health data is the product for sale to insurance companies and others.

In the Hacker News comments, some people agree and say this is another example of “surveillance capitalism”—where companies make money from your private data. They worry about sharing health details with a tech company, especially one under financial stress. Others add that tech companies often promise privacy but change their policies later, so you can’t really trust them with sensitive information.

A few commenters say that in the US, health privacy laws are not strong enough, so this kind of thing is possible. Some people are upset that health data could be used for things like changing insurance costs or targeting ads. But a few users point out that many people already share health info with apps and devices, and that the real problem is weak regulation.

One commenter argues that ChatGPT Health might help people who find the US healthcare system confusing, but even they worry about how the data is used. Another person notes that the service skipping Europe shows that OpenAI knows it cannot meet Europe’s privacy standards. Some hope for open-source or offline AI health tools that don’t send data to big companies. Lastly, some developers wonder if this move will push lawmakers to create better privacy laws, or if people will just accept the risks and use the service anyway.
