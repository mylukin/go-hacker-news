## I Bypassed Amazon's Kindle Web DRM Because Their App Sucked

- 原文链接: [I Bypassed Amazon's Kindle Web DRM Because Their App Sucked](https://blog.pixelmelt.dev/kindle-web-drm/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45610226)

This article is about someone who bought a Kindle ebook from Amazon, but the Kindle app was buggy and kept crashing. The writer wanted to read their book in another app, but Amazon’s DRM made it impossible to download or back up the file.

The author felt frustrated because, even after paying, they could only read the book in Amazon’s broken app. They found out the book could not be accessed in other apps like Calibre, and Amazon could delete the book any time, making it feel more like a rental than a real purchase. Instead of giving up, they decided to reverse-engineer Amazon’s web DRM. By using the Kindle web reader, they discovered that Amazon’s system delivers book data in a TAR file, which includes page data, font glyphs, and other information.

Amazon’s DRM used a tricky system: it doesn’t send real text but instead sends lists of glyph IDs that map to images of each letter. The mapping changes every five pages, so the same letter looks different every time. This meant the author had to process 184 different random alphabets for a 920-page book, with over a million glyphs in total.

Amazon also added fake hints to the font data to break simple scripts. These tricks made it hard to compare glyphs by their SVG paths, so the writer tried using OCR but got poor results. The breakthrough came by rendering each glyph as an image and using perceptual hashes to compare them, matching each shape to the right letter by comparing images from the real font files. This allowed them to decode all the book’s text, including special ligatures and styling, and recreate the original book as an EPUB file with correct formatting.

In the end, the author felt proud for solving the problem as a challenge, but also warned others to use this knowledge only for backing up books they actually own.

Commenters on Hacker News had many strong opinions. Some agreed completely, saying DRM makes buying books worse than piracy, and praised the technical skills and determination shown. Others worried that sharing this tool might hurt authors by making piracy easier, or that it could get the author in legal trouble. Some people pointed out that Amazon’s DRM is so strong because publishers demand it, not just Amazon. A few commenters suggested that if Amazon provided better export tools, users wouldn’t feel forced to hack the system. Several readers shared their own hacks or explained how they use Calibre and DeDRM plugins for similar tasks. Others felt sad that legal buyers are punished more than pirates, and that restrictive DRM drives people to pirate instead of paying. Some people admired the clever technical solution, especially the use of image hashing to match glyphs. A few worried that sharing these tricks publicly will only make Amazon’s DRM harder in the future. Finally, some said the real problem is that we never truly own digital media, and DRM is only getting worse.

## Benjie's Humanoid Olympic Games

- 原文链接: [Benjie's Humanoid Olympic Games](https://generalrobots.substack.com/p/benjies-humanoid-olympic-games)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45609922)

The article talks about the idea of a “Humanoid Olympics” for robots, focusing on real household chores rather than simple robot games. The author wants robots to do useful tasks, like folding laundry, because these are things people actually care about. Today, robots are getting better at copying human actions by watching lots of demonstrations. This works well for some tasks, like folding clothes, where small mistakes are okay and high precision isn’t needed.

But robots still have big problems. They lack force feedback, so they don’t “feel” how hard they’re gripping something. Their finger control is basic—usually just open and close. They have almost no sense of touch, and their movements are only “medium” precise. Because of these limits, robots can do some laundry tasks, but can’t handle complex jobs that need careful touch or strong, smart grips.

To push robotics forward, the author lists a series of challenge events, like opening tricky doors, turning shirts right-side out, buttoning, using spray bottles, spreading peanut butter, picking the right key from a keyring, opening dog bags, and washing dishes. Each event highlights what robots struggle with today—like dexterity, force, and working with wet or messy things. The goal is to inspire new research and celebrate each breakthrough, even offering medals for winners. Only general-purpose, mobile robots running autonomously can compete, and videos must show the full, uncut task.

In the comments, people share lots of views. Some agree laundry folding is an important benchmark, since it’s a real-world task people want help with. Others say the challenges may be too hard now, and robots should focus on simpler jobs first. Some are excited by the idea of open competitions, believing it will speed up progress. A few think most current robots aren’t “general purpose” yet, so these events are tough but useful for setting future goals. There’s debate about whether robots should be mobile or if arms bolted to tables are okay. Some point out that human hands are still far ahead of robot hands, especially for fine touch and grip. Others mention safety concerns—robots with knives or cleaning fluids need to be very reliable. A few bring up cost, saying these competitions could help make useful robots cheaper in the future. Some commenters question if the rules are fair for all kinds of robots, while others just enjoy seeing quirky robot failures. Overall, the community likes the idea of fun, real-world challenges that drive robot progress.

## Claude Skills

- 原文链接: [Claude Skills](https://www.anthropic.com/news/skills)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45607117)

Claude just got a new feature called Skills, which helps it work better on special tasks. Skills are folders with instructions, scripts, and files that Claude can load when needed.

The main idea is that Claude only uses a skill if it fits the job, so it doesn’t slow down. For example, it might use an Excel skill to make spreadsheets or a brand guideline skill to keep documents on-brand. You can use built-in skills or make your own, and they work across Claude apps, Claude Code, and the API.

Skills have these key points: they stack together, so Claude can use many at once; they work the same everywhere; they only load what’s needed; and they can run real code, not just text. This makes Claude a specialist for whatever you want—like having a set of custom guides to teach it your ways.

For users, Skills show up in Claude apps and are easy to make. There’s even a helper skill to walk you through building one, no need to edit files by hand. Teams and businesses can enable Skills for everyone. Developers can use Skills with the Claude API and manage them through a special console, so custom workflows are possible. There are example skills for things like Excel, PowerPoint, and PDFs, and you can find more in their marketplace or GitHub. With Claude Code, you can share skills with your team or load them from plugins.

Real-world examples include making PowerPoints from Box files, working with Notion for faster responses, and helping Canva users build better designs. One finance team cut a whole day’s work down to one hour by using Skills to check spreadsheets and make reports.

People on Hacker News had mixed reactions. Some loved the idea, saying it makes Claude much more useful for real work and could save lots of time. Others worried about security, since Skills can run code—so it’s important to trust the source. A few said this looks like what plugins and APIs already do for other AI tools, but they liked how easy Skills are to set up and share. Some asked about limits: how many skills can run at once, and what happens if two skills conflict? A few thought it might be hard for non-technical users, while others pointed out the interactive helper makes it simple. There was also talk about how this could help big companies roll out AI faster by letting them package their own knowledge. One user worried about data privacy, but others replied that Claude keeps Skills use efficient and minimal. Overall, most agreed this is a smart step for making AI more useful in the workplace.

## Gemini 3.0 spotted in the wild through A/B testing

- 原文链接: [Gemini 3.0 spotted in the wild through A/B testing](https://ricklamers.io/posts/gemini-3-spotted-in-the-wild/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45607758)

This article is about someone testing Google’s new Gemini 3.0 AI model, which is not fully released yet, by using A/B testing in Google AI Studio. The writer wanted to see if the rumors about Gemini 3.0’s improved abilities—especially for coding—were true.

The writer used a special test: asking the AI to make an SVG image of an Xbox 360 controller. SVG images are a good way to see how well an AI can code and understand instructions. The AI made an SVG that looked much better than results from older models or other AIs. The writer shared the exact prompt used, so others could try the same test.

The model name for Gemini 3.0 appeared as a random code, so it’s not clear which exact version was used. The writer thinks it is likely Gemini 3.0 Pro, since comparing two similar versions makes more sense in an A/B test. Gemini 3.0 took about 24 seconds longer to start responding, and its answer was about 40% longer than Gemini 2.5 Pro’s answer. The longer reply also included more “reasoning,” not just the code itself. The writer says these details do not prove everything, but they do show this could be a real improvement, not just a small update.

In the comment section, many people were excited about the improved SVG and coding ability. Some said this shows AI is getting much better at understanding and making images from text. Others warned that good SVG output does not mean the model is much smarter in other ways. A few users shared their own tests and got mixed results—sometimes the AI was much better, sometimes only a little. Some people wished Google would be more open about what they are testing and which models are being used. Others liked that A/B testing lets users see real improvements early. A few were worried about longer response times and if the bigger models might be slower for everyone. Some pointed out that being good at one task, like SVG, does not always mean the model is better overall. Many agreed that seeing real examples, not just scores, helps everyone understand how AI is changing.

## Cloudflare Sandbox SDK

- 原文链接: [Cloudflare Sandbox SDK](https://sandbox.cloudflare.com/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45610523)

Cloudflare’s new Sandbox SDK lets you run code, manage files, and expose services online, all inside secure containers. You can use it to clone code from GitHub, run tests, and even stream output in real time.

With the SDK, you can create folders, write and read files, and run any shell command. You can run Python or JavaScript code and see outputs like charts or tables right away. The tool lets you expose any running service on a public URL, which is handy for quick previews. Long-running tasks are supported too, so you can safely run things that take a lot of time. The SDK handles streaming output live, so you can watch tests or logs as they happen. For example, you can use it to set up a Node.js app, manage files, and test your code all from the same place. Everything runs in a sandbox, which keeps it safe from the rest of your system. The SDK works well for simple file operations, building projects, and sharing live apps during development. Testimonials say it saves a lot of time and is easy to use, with helpful support from Cloudflare.

In the Hacker News comments, some users are excited about the easy setup and see it as a strong tool for building cloud apps. Others compare it to similar tools from companies like GitHub or Replit, and wonder how Cloudflare’s version is different or better. A few people ask about security, especially with running user code in the cloud. Some think it could help with testing and continuous integration, while others are cautious about relying on a new platform. There are questions about pricing, speed, and how well it works for big projects. A few developers like the idea of exposing services quickly for demos or internal tools. Some worry about vendor lock-in or needing to rewrite code to fit the SDK. Overall, the community is interested but wants to see real-world use cases and more details about limits, costs, and security.

## Your data model is your destiny

- 原文链接: [Your data model is your destiny](https://notes.mtb.xyz/p/your-data-model-is-your-destiny)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45583786)

This article says that a startup’s data model—the way it organizes and thinks about its core information—is just as important as the product or market. The data model shapes everything: how the app works, what features get built, and even how the company sells and charges for its product.

The author explains that every company, even if they don’t notice, has a data model. This model is about choosing which things are most important and how they connect. For example, in a database, it’s which tables are central. In the product, it’s what users see first and what actions are easy. If you don’t pick your data model on purpose, you might copy someone else’s without knowing it, and once you build around it, it’s hard to change.

Most companies shouldn’t try to invent a new data model. People are used to certain ways of working, and changing that is tough. But for companies trying to create something new or replace big old players, a unique data model can give a huge edge. The article gives examples: Slack focused on channels, not just messages, which made it stand out. Toast built its system around menu items, not just generic products, so it could handle restaurant needs better. Notion used “blocks” instead of documents, so users could build anything they wanted. Figma used a shared canvas, not files, so everyone could work together live.

Other examples: Rippling made “employee” data the center, so all its products fit together. Klaviyo used order data, not just emails, to help e-commerce stores. ServiceNow connects tickets to whole systems, making IT easier to manage. The author says that as AI and code get easier, the data model is what keeps a company special, because it’s hard to copy once people build their work around it.

In crowded markets, it’s hard for a single product to survive. Winners will be companies whose data model matches what their users really care about. For example, Rippling and Toast could easily add new products that fit perfectly, because their data models were right from the start. Horizontal tools (for everyone) win by changing how things are built, like Figma’s web canvas. Vertical tools (for one industry) win by focusing on the right objects, like Toast’s menu items.

To find a good data model, look for places where old tools force people to use workarounds, like spreadsheets or hacks. Start by understanding the main “unit of work” for your users, not just the data you need to store. Check your database: is the main table the same thing your customers care about? If adding new features means starting from scratch each time, your data model may not be strong enough.

Now, let’s look at what Hacker News readers said. Some comments agree with the author, saying that a good data model helps products grow and makes it hard for others to copy. Others say that in real life, it’s hard to know the best data model early on—sometimes you guess wrong, or markets change. A few point out that companies often get stuck with a bad model and can’t fix it later, which can kill a product.

Some readers add examples from their own work. One person mentions how their company grew because they picked the right data model and could add features fast. Another warns that if you copy a competitor’s model without thinking, you may miss what users really need. Some say that “data model” isn’t just about databases, but about how the whole team thinks about the business.

A few disagree with the article a bit. They say sometimes “good enough” is fine, especially for small startups. Others think AI might change things so much that data models won’t matter as much in the future. Some comments worry that focusing too much on the data model can slow you down, especially if you’re just getting started.

Overall, people liked the article and thought it was helpful. Many agreed that a strong, clear data model can make a product better and harder to beat, but it’s not always easy to get right. The best advice from the comments: listen to users, watch how they work, and always be ready to learn and adjust.

## Nobody Cares How Hard You Work

- 原文链接: [Nobody Cares How Hard You Work](https://alifeengineered.substack.com/p/nobody-cares-how-hard-you-work)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45610636)

This article talks about how working hard does not matter if your work does not create real value for others. The writer shares a story about meeting a YouTuber who made over 5,000 videos in eight years, but still had only a few hundred subscribers and very few views. The YouTuber was talented and put in a lot of effort, but his videos did not solve any real problem for viewers. The main lesson is that people care about the value you create, not just your effort.

The article explains the idea of “Product-Market Fit.” This means you must match what you can do (your skills or product) to a real need or pain that others have. In jobs and careers, companies hire people to solve painful, expensive problems, not just because someone works hard or has good skills. The writer gives the example of accountants, who are in high demand because the problems they solve (like taxes and audits) are painful and common.

The writer also shares a story from working at Amazon. A team was blamed for slow progress and buggy code, but the real problem was their difficult and slow deployment process, not a lack of skill. By helping the team show the business impact of this pain, they finally got support to fix the problem. The writer says your most valuable skill is often something that feels easy to you, but is hard for others. To find your true skill, ask yourself what kinds of problems you like to solve, what tasks give you energy, and what compliments you brush off.

The article gives practical advice: ask your boss or coworkers about their biggest pain points, then focus on solving these. Build repeatable solutions, share them, and let others know you can solve this type of problem. This creates a “value loop” where you become known for solving important problems, and more opportunities come to you.

In the end, the writer tells us that working hard matters only when your work is aimed at solving the right problem. If you spend time on things that do not help others, nobody will notice. But if you solve painful problems, even small actions can make you a hero.

In the comments, many people agree with the main point: results are what matter, not just effort. Some share their own stories about working hard but not being noticed until they solved a real problem. Others say this lesson is true in many fields, not just tech. A few commenters warn that sometimes managers or companies do not notice value even when it is created, and that luck or politics can play a role, too.

Some readers discuss the pressure to always find “pain points,” saying this can be stressful or lead to burnout. Others point out that sometimes hard work is needed to build skills before you can create value, but it is easy to get stuck just working hard and not moving forward. There are also comments about how this lesson applies to open-source projects, where many developers work hard but few projects get noticed unless they solve a common problem.

A few commenters mention that finding product-market fit for yourself is not easy, and it can take time to discover what you are best at and what others really need. Some say that asking “what problem am I solving?” is a good way to focus your efforts, at work or in side projects. Others note that sometimes you have to try many things before you find the right fit, and that is OK.

In the end, most commenters agree: working hard is not enough—you need to work on things that matter to others. This is the key to getting noticed and making a difference.

## DoorDash and Waymo launch autonomous delivery service in Phoenix

- 原文链接: [DoorDash and Waymo launch autonomous delivery service in Phoenix](https://about.doordash.com/en-us/news/waymo)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45605501)

DoorDash and Waymo are working together to bring self-driving cars to deliver orders in Phoenix. They are also offering DashPass members $10 off one Waymo ride per month in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Phoenix until the end of the year.

The autonomous delivery service is being tested now in Metro Phoenix and will grow to more places later. If you order from DoorDash in that area, a self-driving Waymo car might bring your delivery, starting with DashMart stores. DoorDash’s special system, called the Autonomous Delivery Platform, helps choose the best way to deliver—using people, robots, drones, or Waymo cars. DashPass members get special deals, including free or cheaper delivery and now this Waymo discount. DoorDash says members save money on most orders and have saved a lot since DashPass began in 2018. Both companies say the partnership is about making deliveries easier, safer, and more fun, while giving people more choices. The $10 Waymo ride discount works on weekdays from 2 a.m. to 2 p.m. Each month, members get a new promo code for this deal.

In the Hacker News comments, some people are excited about seeing self-driving cars used for real deliveries, not just tests. A few think it could make deliveries faster and cheaper, and are curious about how well the cars handle things like parking or finding the right house. Others wonder if people will miss talking to delivery drivers, or if new problems—like cars blocking driveways—might appear. Some users talk about jobs: they worry robots and self-driving cars could put human delivery drivers out of work, while others think new kinds of jobs will be created to manage and fix these systems. There are also questions about safety, how well the cars drive in bad weather, and how they handle surprises on the road. Some commenters doubt the service will work everywhere, since city layouts and traffic rules are different. A few share stories about past experiences with self-driving cars and say they are impressed, but others think it is still too soon to trust them fully. Overall, the community is split—some are hopeful, while others are cautious about this new technology.

## Codex Is Live in Zed

- 原文链接: [Codex Is Live in Zed](https://zed.dev/blog/codex-is-live-in-zed)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45606698)

Zed now lets you use OpenAI’s Codex AI tool right inside the Zed code editor, thanks to a new protocol called ACP. This means you can pick Codex from the menu, just like other AI agents, and start coding with AI help without any extra setup.

The ACP (Agent Client Protocol) lets Zed connect to different coding AIs, such as Codex, Claude Code, or Gemini CLI. Zed does not charge you to use these agents, and your code never passes through Zed’s servers—only between you and the AI provider. The team has also released the Codex-ACP adapter as open source, so anyone can use it with other editors.

Each AI agent works differently. For example, some let you switch AI models in a chat, while others make you use the same model the whole time. Some agents store old conversations so you can look back, but others do not remember chat history. ACP is flexible to support these differences, but how it feels to use each agent can change.

A technical detail: Codex runs terminal commands itself and streams the results to Zed. Before, it was common for the agent to ask Zed to run a command, and Zed would handle it. This switch changes how things work, especially with terminals. If an agent uses PTY (pseudoterminal) mode, you can interact with the terminal in Zed and see colorful output. But this can cause problems—if the AI runs a command like “git rebase --continue” and waits for editor input, the AI can get stuck waiting forever. Non-PTY mode avoids these deadlocks but has less interactivity and color.

Now, with agents that use both PTY and non-PTY modes, the Zed team can compare both styles and improve future ACP setups. Zed already supports several agents, and other editors like Neovim, Emacs, and JetBrains IDEs are starting to use ACP too. Going forward, the Zed team wants to work more with the community to grow ACP, instead of building every agent connection themselves.

In the Hacker News comments, many users were excited about how ACP could make different editors more open to new AI features. Some praised Zed for open-sourcing the adapter, saying it helps push the whole ecosystem forward. Others liked that Zed doesn’t handle your code, so privacy is better. A few users said the differences between PTY and non-PTY modes could be confusing and hoped for better ways to avoid agents getting stuck. Some developers wondered how hard it would be to add new agents, and a few shared tips from their own experiments with ACP in other editors. Others debated which AI agent is best for coding help, with some saying Codex is still strong, while others prefer Claude or Gemini. Finally, several people liked that Zed is now available on all major platforms and plan to try it out.
