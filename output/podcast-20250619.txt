Hello everyone, this is the 2025-06-19 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we explore a variety of fascinating tech stories and discussions from the community. Let's dive in!

First up, we have Hurl, a tool to run and test HTTP requests using simple text files. Written in Rust and using libcurl, Hurl allows developers to chain requests, capture values, and test responses for different APIs like REST, SOAP, and GraphQL. It's fast, reliable, and integrates well with CI/CD pipelines. Users on Hacker News compared Hurl to Postman and HTTPie, praising its ability to handle complex workflows and share API tests as text files. However, some noted missing features like snapshot testing and WebSocket support.

Next, we discuss ExTracker, a BitTorrent tracker built with Elixir by a developer named Dahrkael. It's designed for high performance, using all CPU cores and low memory, efficiently managing peer connections. ExTracker supports several BitTorrent Enhancement Proposals and can handle 1,000,000 peers with minimal RAM usage. Users expressed admiration for the project and Elixir's capabilities, with some suggesting technical improvements for better performance and monitoring.

Moving on, we talk about Infinite Mac, a project that emulates early Mac OS X versions, specifically 10.1 and 10.3. The emulation uses PearPC and DingusPPC, with efforts to improve performance and stability. Commenters shared nostalgia for the old Mac OS X design and discussed the evolution from Mac OS 7 to OS X, reflecting on design strengths and weaknesses.

Then, we explore "Virtual Cells," an article about simulating biological cells with computers. This field began with nerve modeling in 1952 and has advanced to whole-cell simulations used in drug discovery and personalized medicine. The integration of AI and machine learning has accelerated this development, making simulations faster and more accurate. Users discussed the potential of combining AI with mechanistic models for more effective predictions.

Next, we highlight FedFlix, a collaboration between NTIS and Public.Resource.Org to make government stock footage publicly available. The project involves digitizing non-copyrighted videotapes for free distribution. Users appreciated the initiative for increasing accessibility to government resources and preserving public domain material.

We then cover a New York Times article about scientists working to make cannabis products more predictable and reliable. By studying genetics and growing environments, they aim to standardize products for consistent effects. Commenters noted the importance of standardization for medical cannabis and discussed challenges in achieving this due to natural variability.

Also in the news is "Git Smart Squash," a tool using AI to organize messy commit histories into logical, well-structured commits for PRs. It saves time by automating commit reorganization, with a dry-run feature for previewing changes. Users appreciated the tool's potential but suggested improvements for aligning commits with tasks and handling complex situations.

In another story, a new method for faster large language model inference involves a "megakernel" that combines computations and communications into one GPU kernel. The MPK compiler automates this process, reducing time and enhancing performance. Commenters were impressed with the development and discussed its potential integration into frameworks like PyTorch.

Finally, we explore the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile, a telescope that captures large images of the sky quickly. It can cover the entire visible sky every three days, detecting changes like moving objects or cosmic events. Users expressed excitement about its potential to expand knowledge of asteroids and its massive data output.

To wrap up, we have the Sunsonic 986-II, a Thai Famicom clone with a built-in keyboard and mini CRT screen. Popular in Southeast Asia, Famicom clones often included educational features. Users shared nostalgia for these gadgets and speculated about the possibilities of a Thai gaming console today.

That's all for today's episode. Thank you for listening, and we hope you enjoyed these diverse tech stories and discussions. Join us tomorrow for more insights from the world of technology.
