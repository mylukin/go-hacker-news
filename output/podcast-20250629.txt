Hello everyone, this is the 2025-06-29 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have a full show for software developers and tech fans. Let’s get started.

First, let’s look at new ideas in Rust error handling. Many Rust developers use a big error enum for a whole module or crate, even if some errors do not really belong to every function. This can make the code harder to read, because you see error types that do not match your function. The strict type system in Rust is a big strength, but giant error enums go against this idea. Developers often add all possible errors to one enum, just to avoid writing new error types and conversions for every function. Some people try to use individual structs for each error and group them, but that can be a lot of work and make the code more complex.

A new crate called error_set tries to help. It uses macros so you can define error sets quickly and get conversions between them for free. With error_set!, you can build enums from variants and also from other error sets. The question mark operator in Rust will work if your function’s error set includes the error set from a called function, so error handling becomes simpler.

The article shows code examples of how error sets work together. The author admits that it is still a bit verbose if you want to add more data to errors, but thinks this is a good trade-off. Other crates like terrors and SmartErr also try to improve error handling in Rust. The author wishes for a crate that can auto-generate error enums just by looking at the function body.

In the comments, some people are tired of new macros and prefer simple error enums because they are easy to understand and do not add magic code. Others like error sets for libraries where you want clear and specific error types. One person wonders if you really need a different error type for every function, saying that sometimes you just want to know a file could not be read, not exactly where it failed. There is a real debate between more detailed but complex error types and simple, familiar patterns. Some want more safety and clarity, while others want code that is easy to read and maintain.

Next, we have a clever story about malware detection in virtual machines. Some malware will check for hardware, like a CPU fan, to guess if it is running inside a VM. The author wanted to trick malware by making a VM show that it has a CPU fan. On Windows, the system checks something called SMBIOS data to see if hardware like a fan is present. The Win32_Fan class gets its data from SMBIOS type 27, which describes fans. The author learned how to add a fake fan entry to the SMBIOS data in Xen, but at first, this did not work. Later, he found that you also need to add a fake temperature probe, SMBIOS type 28, because the fan entry points to this sensor. After adding both, Windows showed a CPU fan in the VM.

For QEMU/KVM users, it is easier to add fake SMBIOS data with a command line option, and you can even use your host’s SMBIOS data. In the comments, people found this project funny and smart. Some said that malware uses many tricks to detect VMs, so just adding a CPU fan is not enough. Others explained that SMBIOS editing can help with other hardware checks too. Some warned that copying real SMBIOS data can cause problems or be used for cheating in games or with software licenses. Many people enjoyed the write-up and said they learned something new about hardware and virtualization. Some joked about malware always finding new ways to catch VMs, making this a never-ending game between attackers and defenders.

Now let’s move on to the monthly Hacker News “what are you working on” thread. Many users shared their projects, startups, open-source tools, and learning goals. Some are building apps for grammar checking, personal finance, or teaching coding. There are also projects in machine learning, home automation, blogging, writing books, and making online courses. People share their updates, ask for feedback, and invite others to try their products.

In the comments, the community is very supportive. People offer advice on marketing, building a user base, and choosing the right tools and languages. Some talk about the challenge of finding time after work for side projects. Others share stories about making money or just building for fun. Many say they enjoy seeing what others are working on and feel inspired by the thread. There are also discussions about how to meet people with similar interests. Overall, it is a friendly and encouraging place for sharing and learning.

Next, we have news about a new Go pub/sub library that is much faster than older options. This library works inside the same process, so it does not need to send data over the network. It uses Go channels and careful memory management for speed. The benchmarks show it is four to ten times faster than Redis or NATS for the same job. The library is easy for Go programmers to use and is good for logging, events, or simple task queues inside one application. It is not made for sending messages between different computers.

The author gives tips for using the library with many subscribers or lots of messages. In the comments, some people are excited about the speed. Others say that networked tools like Redis are still needed for bigger systems. There are questions about thread safety, memory use, and what happens if you need to restart your program and keep messages. Some warn not to replace proven systems too quickly, but many are interested in trying this new tool for simple jobs.

Now to a new open-source networking tool called Octelium. Octelium helps you connect computers and services over the internet, similar to Teleport, Cloudflare, Tailscale, and Ngrok. Its special feature is that you can run your own relay servers, so you control where your data goes. Octelium supports peer-to-peer connections and uses modern encryption. It works on Linux, Windows, and Mac, and has a simple command-line interface.

On Hacker News, people are happy to see a free and open-source alternative to popular services. Some ask about setup difficulty and if non-experts can use Octelium easily. Others compare it to WireGuard and ZeroTier and ask what makes it different. Some like the idea of self-hosting, but worry about security and maintenance. There are questions about speed and possible features like mobile apps. Some point out that open-source projects can be hard to keep alive and hope Octelium gets enough support. Many say they will try it for side projects or home labs. The community is interested and wants to see real-world results.

Let’s talk about ransomware. Many ransomware programs skip computers if they see a Russian or similar keyboard installed. This is common for cybercriminals from Russia and Eastern Europe, who want to avoid problems with local law enforcement. For example, the DarkSide group, which attacked Colonial Pipeline, checks for languages like Russian or Ukrainian and stops if it finds them. This is because local police only investigate if locals are attacked. Some experts say you can add a Russian keyboard to your settings to trick some ransomware, though this is not a full solution.

In the comments, people joke about the trick, but others warn it does not protect you from all malware. Some suggest switching to Linux or Mac, but others say no system is perfect. There are technical questions about what happens if you install many languages, or how malware could check which keyboard is actually in use. Some warn about problems from running unknown scripts to add languages. There is debate about security on Macs versus Windows, and finally, jokes about installing Klingon keyboards. Most people agree it is a clever trick, but not a real solution for security.

Next, we have a simple look at Bloom filters. A Bloom filter is a data structure that helps you quickly check if something is in a set, using little memory. It can give false positives, but never false negatives. To add an item, you hash it with a few hash functions and set bits in a bit vector. To check if an item is present, you run the same hashes and check if all those bits are set. If any bit is off, the item is not present.

The article talks about choosing fast hash functions, like Murmur or xxHash, and tuning the size of the filter and number of hash functions. Bloom filters are used in browsers, databases, and big data tools. They are good when you cannot store every item but need quick checks. In the comments, people say Bloom filters are great for saving memory, but warn that they do not support removing items, and false positives can be a problem. Some suggest Cuckoo filters for more advanced cases. Others say for tiny sets, a simple list or set is easier.

Now, let’s talk about how to fix losing IPv4 at home. After a power cut, the author’s home lost IPv4 but still had IPv6, and many websites stopped working. The problem is that most websites do not support IPv6 yet. The author used a VPS with both IPv4 and IPv6 and set up a WireGuard VPN tunnel from home to the VPS, sending all traffic through it. The author shares technical details on setting up WireGuard and network namespaces, and solving problems like setting the right MTU.

In the comments, people share similar problems with ISPs and CG-NAT. Many agree that IPv6 should be used more, but too many sites do not support it. Some warn that VPNs and tunnels can be confusing, and thank the author for sharing tips and configs. There is debate about using commercial VPNs versus your own VPS. Some users say Linux is better for advanced networking, and thank the author for showing the power of these tools.

Next, we look at the Medley Interlisp Project, which is bringing back an old programming system from Xerox PARC. Medley Interlisp is important in LISP history and had features like DWIM, which tried to fix your programming mistakes, and the first UNDO function. The project wants Medley to run on Windows, Mac, and Linux, and to work with modern tools like Unicode and the clipboard.

The journey has not been easy. The software is old, documentation was missing, and the code had bugs and needed to be merged from different versions. But now, Medley runs on modern systems, and you can even try it in your browser or with Docker. The team is updating the documentation and building a big bibliography for researchers. On Hacker News, people are excited to see Medley revived. Some remember using Interlisp and praise its flexibility and living environment. Others ask about how to help and try Medley. Some worry about losing old software and ideas, and hope projects like this can teach new generations about programming history.

Finally, let’s talk about the famous quote “premature optimization is the root of all evil.” The article explains what Donald Knuth really meant. People often use this quote to say that small optimizations are always bad, but Knuth did not say that. He said that you should not waste time optimizing code that does not matter, but if you know a part is important, small optimizations can help. Knuth also said that compilers do not always make these changes for you, so sometimes you need to do them by hand.

The author runs benchmarks and shows that for small sets, all versions of the code are about the same speed, but for big sets, better data structures help a lot. The advice is to use well-made library functions. In the comments, some people agree that Knuth is often misquoted, and that you should measure before optimizing. Others say that compilers are smarter now, but not perfect. Some share stories of bad code written for fake optimizations. Most agree: measure first, use good libraries, and do not optimize blindly or too early. But, small changes in critical code can matter.

That’s all for today’s episode. Thank you for listening to Hacker News Daily Podcast. We hope you enjoyed the stories and insights. See you next time!
