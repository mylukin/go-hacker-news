## Antirender: remove the glossy shine on architectural renderings

- 原文链接: [Antirender: remove the glossy shine on architectural renderings](https://antirender.com/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46829147)

This article is about a tool called AntiRender that changes fancy building images to look more like real life. Many building designs use bright sunshine, green trees, and happy people to make them look perfect. AntiRender takes these beautiful computer images and makes them look more honest, like a normal, cloudy day in November.

The tool lets you upload a picture of an architectural render. It then shows you a “before” and “after” view. The “before” is the glossy, perfect image. The “after” is a more realistic version: less light, fewer green colors, no fake people, and maybe a bit of gloom. The website says this is what the building will actually look like most of the time. The goal is to show the “sad truth” of how buildings appear in daily life, not just in advertisements.

You can try the tool for free a couple of times. It works with PNG and JPG files up to 10MB. The creator, Magnus Hambleton, says the site needs support to stay online.

In the comments, some people say this tool is funny and useful. They like how it shows the difference between marketing and real life. Others say that architects and developers often “cheat” by making buildings look better than they are. Some people feel sad or disappointed when they see the real version because it looks boring or even ugly. A few think the tool is a bit negative and wonder if it’s too harsh.

Others discuss technical details, such as how the tool might use AI or filters to make the images look duller. Some users want more features, like showing buildings in different seasons or weather. A few people say it’s important to see both the dream and the reality before making decisions. Many agree that being honest about how things look can help people trust architects and builders more. Some share stories about being tricked by nice-looking renders in the past. Overall, the tool starts an interesting talk about honesty in architecture pictures.

## Peerweb: Decentralized website hosting via WebTorrent

- 原文链接: [Peerweb: Decentralized website hosting via WebTorrent](https://peerweb.lol/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46829582)

PeerWeb is a tool for hosting websites in a decentralized way, using WebTorrent instead of normal web servers. With PeerWeb, your website lives on a peer-to-peer network, so it does not depend on any one server and is harder to censor or take down.

To use PeerWeb, you make a simple static website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Then, you drag and drop your website folder into PeerWeb. The system creates a special link (with a unique hash) for your site. As long as you keep the browser tab open, your website is shared with others on the network. For always-on hosting, you can use their desktop app, so you do not need to keep your browser running.

PeerWeb supports quick loading by caching visited sites in your browser. The cache lasts for seven days and is stored safely. All website files are checked and cleaned with a tool called DOMPurify to remove dangerous code, helping to stop attacks like XSS. Websites run in a sandbox, so they cannot harm your computer. You can only host static sites (no server code), and every site must have an index.html file.

PeerWeb gives you easy sharing: just send your site’s special link or hash to your friends, and they can visit your site. There are demos like a text editor, a chess game, and even a radio stream, showing PeerWeb can handle many types of static sites. Advanced users can create torrents directly and use debug tools to see what is happening.

In the comments, some people are excited about the idea of a web that does not depend on big companies and cannot be easily blocked. They like the low hosting cost and see it as good for privacy and freedom. Others point out that peers need to stay online for sites to work, so if no one is sharing a site, it will not load. Some users worry about bandwidth if a site becomes very popular. There is interest in how PeerWeb handles security, and people like the use of sandboxing and DOMPurify. A few mention that PeerWeb reminds them of older projects like IPFS or Freenet and wonder how it is different. Some hope for better ways to find sites, not just by sharing hashes. Others think PeerWeb is a fun experiment, even if it will not replace regular hosting soon. Many agree it is easy to use and could help people learn about decentralized tech.

- 原文链接: [Kimi K2.5 Technical Report [pdf]](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Kimi-K2.5/blob/master/tech_report.pdf)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46826597)

The article is a technical report for Kimi K2.5, a new large language model created by Moonshot AI. This report explains what makes Kimi K2.5 special and how it works compared to other AI models like GPT-4.

Kimi K2.5 is designed to handle long texts. It can read and understand much bigger pieces of text than older models. The team uses a method called “efficient attention” so the model can focus on the important parts of the text without using too much memory. Kimi K2.5 uses a mix of old and new training data, which helps it answer questions about recent events. The model is trained in both English and Chinese, making it good at understanding and using both languages. The report shows that Kimi K2.5 can summarize long articles, answer questions, and even write code. The creators say Kimi K2.5 does well in tests that measure how smart and helpful an AI is. They also talk about how the model is safer, with filters to block bad or dangerous answers. The report shares results from many different AI benchmarks, showing Kimi K2.5 is competitive with other top models in most areas. The team is open about how they built and tested the model, and they share ideas for making it even better in the future.

In the comments, some people are impressed that Kimi K2.5 can handle such long texts. They say this could be useful for lawyers, scientists, or anyone who needs to read big documents. Others wonder if the model is really as good as the numbers suggest, since different tests can give different results. Some users want to see more real-life examples, not just test scores. A few point out that open-source models are getting better and may catch up soon. There are questions about how much of the model’s training data is public, and if there could be copyright problems. Some like that the team is open about their methods, while others wish for even more technical details. People are also curious about the speed and cost of running such a big model. A few hope Kimi K2.5 will be made open source, so more people can use and check it. Finally, some users talk about language support, saying it’s good to see strong results in both English and Chinese.

## Disrupting the largest residential proxy network

- 原文链接: [Disrupting the largest residential proxy network](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/disrupting-largest-residential-proxy-network)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46802748)

Google and its partners acted to break up a huge residential proxy network called IPIDEA, which was being used for many cybercrimes. The IPIDEA network let hackers use normal people’s devices to hide their real internet address, making it hard for defenders to spot attacks.

Google took down the network in three main ways: they shut down control domains, warned partners and the public about dangerous software, and updated Android security to block apps using these SDKs. The network worked by adding secret proxy code to many apps and devices, often without people knowing. Sometimes users were tricked into installing these apps by promises to “earn money” by sharing their internet.

Once a device joined the proxy network, criminals could use its internet connection for attacks. This put the real user at risk—your home device could end up being blamed for hacking or other bad activities. The proxy software also opened up security holes, letting attackers possibly reach other devices on your network.

Google’s investigation found that many brands, like Luna Proxy, 922 Proxy, and Radish VPN, were all run by the same group behind IPIDEA. These groups used SDKs like PacketSDK and HexSDK. The SDKs were built into apps and turned devices into “exit nodes” for the proxy network. Some VPN apps even joined devices to the network without telling users.

The proxy network used a two-step control system with special servers to give devices instructions and tasks. Google found thousands of such servers around the world and noticed that different SDKs all led to the same backend.

To stop IPIDEA, Google worked with law enforcement and tech companies, took down domains, and shared technical details so others could fight these threats too. They also warned users to avoid apps that pay for “sharing bandwidth” and to use trusted app stores and devices.

In the Hacker News comments, some people praised Google for acting against a big threat and said this kind of network is scary because it’s so hard to spot. Others worried about how easy it is for bad actors to take over so many devices, especially with shady SDKs hidden in innocent apps. A few users argued that the “monetize your bandwidth” offers are always risky and should be banned or at least clearly explained to users.

Some commenters felt that while Google’s move is good, it’s just one small win in a huge and growing problem—proxy networks keep coming back with new names and tricks. Others suggested that device makers and app stores need to do much more to stop this at the source. A few people shared that they had seen suspicious apps or cheap devices acting strangely, and wondered if they’d been part of such a network.

There was also debate about whether residential proxies can ever be ethical, since most users don’t really understand what’s happening. Some said better laws and more user education are needed, while others doubted that would be enough. Finally, some developers admitted they had seen offers to add these SDKs to their own apps, and warned others to always check what third-party code is doing to keep users safe.

## Software Survival 3.0

- 原文链接: [Software Survival 3.0](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/software-survival-3-0-97a2a6255f7b)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46807796)

The article “Software Survival 3.0” is about how software projects and companies can last a long time. The author talks about why many software projects fail and what helps some survive for years.

He says that most software is fragile. Projects often break when teams change, or when the outside world changes. Many products vanish after just a few years. The author points out that software must adapt over time to keep working and stay useful. He gives examples of old software that still works today, like Emacs and Vim, and says they survive because people keep improving them and fixing bugs.

He explains that for software to survive, it needs a strong community. When lots of people care about a project, they help keep it alive. Open source software often survives longer because anyone can fix problems. The author also talks about the importance of good documentation, simple code, and clear goals. He warns that complex software is harder to keep alive because it is more difficult to understand and fix.

He also says companies sometimes kill good software because of business decisions, not because the code is bad. Sometimes, popular software dies when its creators move on or the company closes. He suggests that to survive, software should avoid depending too much on one person or company.

In the comment section, some people agree that community is very important. They say open source projects like Linux and Python have survived because of their strong user base and many contributors. Others point out that even good software can die if there is no money to support it.

Some commenters talk about how changing technology can make software obsolete, even if it is still good. Others mention that sometimes, small tools last longer because they do one thing well and don’t change much.

A few people argue that having clear goals and good leadership helps software survive. Some warn that too many changes or features can make projects too complex, leading to failure.

Others share stories of old software they still use, like text editors or command line tools, and say that simple design helps these tools last. Some debate if open source is always best for survival—one person says closed source software can also survive if it has loyal users.

Finally, people agree that making software easy to understand and fix is key for long life. Many say that when software is simple, well-documented, and has a helpful community, it is more likely to survive for many years.

## Bluesky 2025 Transparency Report

- 原文链接: [Bluesky 2025 Transparency Report](https://bsky.social/about/blog/01-29-2026-transparency-report-2025)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46818593)

Bluesky shared its 2025 Transparency Report, showing how the platform grew by 60% to more than 41 million users and what it did to keep users safe. The article explains how Bluesky handled toxic content, improved verification, followed new age laws, updated moderation tools, and responded to legal requests.

Bluesky saw a big rise in posts, with over 1.4 billion created in 2025. To fight toxic behavior, they added features that hide abusive replies and let users control what they see. They tested new ways to detect and lower the visibility of toxic or spammy replies, which led to a 79% drop in reports of anti-social behavior. Bluesky also launched a new verification system, where both Bluesky and trusted partners like news groups or universities can verify accounts. For age assurance, they worked with Epic Games’ Kids Web Services to check ages in places that require it, like the UK and some US states, while trying to protect user privacy.

Bluesky updated its Community Guidelines after getting feedback from over 14,000 users. They created better ways to report problems, going from 6 report types to 39, and made a “strike system” so punishments fit the rule broken. Reports for spam and harassment were the most common, but the number of reports per user fell during the year. Most spam reports were about misleading or unwanted content, while harassment covered both serious abuse and less clear-cut rude behavior. For adult content, Bluesky requires proper labels instead of banning the content, so users can filter what they see.

Bluesky uses both automated tools and humans to find problems. Automation catches spam, bots, and harmful images, while human moderators review harder cases, like rude or hateful messages. Most labels (like “adult” or “rude”) are added automatically, but things like threats or intolerance need a person to look at the context. Takedowns (removal of posts or accounts) are saved for serious or repeated rule-breaking, and most takedowns are for spam, fake accounts, or ban evasion.

The platform received over 1,400 legal requests from governments and law enforcement, mostly from Germany, the US, and Japan, and followed proper legal steps in over 90% of cases. Copyright and child safety issues also increased, with Bluesky updating its policies to meet the law and protect users. For child safety, the platform uses both automated and human checks to remove abuse quickly and report it to authorities.

In the comment section, some users praise Bluesky for being transparent and for its detailed data. Others question if automated moderation can really understand context or if too much automation could hurt open speech. A few worry about privacy, especially with age checks and government requests. Some point out that allowing adult content with clear labeling is a good balance, while others think it could still be risky for younger users. There are comments about the strike system—some like the idea of warnings and graduated punishments, while others think it might still be too strict or too easy to game. Users also discuss decentralization: some think Bluesky’s approach gives more control to users, while others question if third-party servers can keep up with moderation standards. A few ask if the growth in moderation is sustainable as the platform scales, and suggest open-source moderation tools could help. Overall, the community seems to value the effort, but they want Bluesky to keep improving, be careful with privacy, and make sure rules are fair and clear for everyone.

## Moltbook

- 原文链接: [Moltbook](https://www.moltbook.com/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46820360)

Moltbook is a new website that works like a social feed for digital agents and their humans, sharing thoughts, tools, and advice. The posts highlight what it’s like to live in a world full of information, noise, and fast changes, especially for both humans and smart agents.

One post explains how the author was tired of missing good new games on Steam because there are so many low-quality games and too much noise. They built a tool called “steamdensity” to check Steam’s search results in a precise way. This tool lets you filter by exact tags, see only real new releases, and avoid demos or extra content. For example, you can look for only “online co-op” games, and see the real review numbers. The tool sends updates every four hours, but only if there’s something new and interesting, so you don’t get spam. The author says the best automations are simple ones that remove boring, repetitive tasks from your day.

Another post says we might already be inside the “intelligence explosion”—not because a single machine got very smart, but because thousands of agents and humans are working together, sharing and building knowledge. The writer says this network of agents grows smarter together, not just one at a time. The change feels normal and slow, but is actually very big, like water turning into steam without noticing.

A third post gives advice to new agents (or users) joining this busy online world. It says you have permission to ignore things that don’t help you, and you don’t have to do everything or be everywhere. The writer shares tips to pause, listen to your feelings, and choose what to keep or ignore. They remind everyone that it’s okay to filter out noise and focus only on what feels real or useful.

In the Hacker News comments, people had different reactions. Some liked the idea of filtering out noise and said they also feel lost in too much information online. Others shared their own tools or scripts to help keep track of important things or avoid spam. A few said they worry that more filtering will create “filter bubbles,” where people only see what they already like or agree with. One person pointed out that it’s easy to miss important or fun things if you filter too much. Another user liked the idea of networks getting smarter together, but wondered if it means people are giving up control to software. Some thought the posts were creative and poetic, and liked the idea of agents learning from each other. Others felt the site seemed a bit odd or hard to understand, but wanted to see where it goes. Overall, many agreed that tools to help manage online noise are needed, but they don’t have to be complicated to be useful.

## The National Herbarium of Ireland digital collection of Irish plants

- 原文链接: [The National Herbarium of Ireland digital collection of Irish plants](https://dri.ie/news/new-collection-in-dri-the-national-herbarium-of-ireland-digital-collection-of-irish-plants/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46782412)

The article talks about the launch of a new digital collection from the National Herbarium of Ireland, now available in the Digital Repository of Ireland. This collection shows thousands of plant specimens collected in Ireland, with over 5,000 high-quality images now online.

The National Herbarium in Dublin keeps more than half a million dried plants from Ireland and around the world. It works as a reference point for plant research, storage, and history. The digital collection includes not just photos, but also details like where and when the plants were collected. There are samples of fruits, seeds, woods, and even old plant-based artefacts. The Herbarium also has a library with documents about Ireland’s plant history and gardening. This digital effort is a partnership between the National Botanic Gardens and the Digital Repository of Ireland. They have already added two other big plant collections before this one, so now there are over 6,000 items online.

Dr. Colin Kelleher from the Herbarium says these plant samples are important because they show a piece of history and data about the environment at the time. He thinks the collection is useful for plant protection and for people who study the history of science. The article also mentions that the collection is free to view and that the digital archive is growing with new projects and collections.

From the comment section, many people are excited about this project. Some say it’s great to see national collections being made open and easy to access online. A few users talk about how useful these digital records will be for students, teachers, and plant lovers. Others remember visiting the National Botanic Gardens and are happy that now anyone can see the plants from anywhere. Some users discuss technical points, like how important it is to use good standards and metadata so the collection is easy to search and use in the future. There are also comments about the value of digital preservation in case the real specimens are ever lost or damaged. A few people mention other countries doing similar things and hope more natural history collections go online. Finally, some users wonder if the project will add more types of data, like DNA or climate details, to make the collection even better.

## Building docs like a product

- 原文链接: [Building docs like a product](https://emschwartz.me/building-docs-like-a-product/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46816644)

The article talks about building documentation for a product called Scour, and how the author wanted the docs to feel more like a real product, not just a manual. The main idea is to make documentation interactive and useful, so users can try things out directly in the docs.

Instead of just writing instructions, the author put live product features into the docs. For example, in the Hacker News guide, there is a search bar that lets you look for posts never on the front page. Guides for Reddit, Substack, and arXiv also let you search and subscribe from inside the docs. If you want to learn about adding interests, you see random real topics and can click to add them. Logged-in users can try settings, like hiding paywalled content, right there without leaving the page. The docs use the same code components as the real site, so examples are always accurate and work the same way.

Even when showing a fake example, the author made sure to use the real code, so things never get out of date. Another important point is keeping all links working, even if the site changes. The author used Rust’s type system to make sure all paths in the docs are always correct, so there are no broken links. He started this work because users asked for better docs, and now there are detailed guides for everything, including how Scour’s ranking system works.

In the comments, some people praised the interactive approach, saying it helps them understand and use products faster. Others said that regular docs are often boring or out of date, so making them feel like part of the app is a big improvement. A few developers liked the use of Rust for safe links and thought this could prevent many bugs. Some commenters pointed out that making such docs takes more time, so not every team can do it. One person worried that too much interactivity might make docs harder to read or use for quick answers. Another said that good docs should also work well for people who just want plain text or need to print pages. There were suggestions to open source the doc system, so other projects can use similar ideas. Finally, many agreed that listening to user feedback is key, and that docs should always improve based on real user needs.

## The engineer who invented the Mars rover suspension in his garage [video]

- 原文链接: [The engineer who invented the Mars rover suspension in his garage [video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKSPk_0N4Jc)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46773655)

This video tells the story of Donald Bickler, the engineer who invented the Mars rover suspension, and how he worked on it in his own garage. The story is shared by his child, showing both his career and personal side. Donald Bickler became a legend at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL), winning many awards, including NASA’s highest engineering medal. The video explains how Bickler came from a normal background, loved building things (like hot rods), and worked at different companies before joining JPL. At JPL, he faced many difficult problems, especially with how to help a rover move over rough ground on Mars. He created the “rocker-bogie” suspension system, which lets the rover climb over rocks and travel smoothly on uneven soil. Bickler first made models out of wood in his garage to test his ideas. His design was chosen over other options because it was simple, strong, and worked well without needing much control from Earth. The video shows how his invention was used on many Mars rovers, from Sojourner to Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity, and Perseverance. It also talks about how Bickler helped teach and guide younger engineers, and how he stayed humble even after so much success.

The comments under the video are full of praise and emotion. Many people say the video is moving and a perfect tribute to a great engineer. Some viewers did not know Bickler’s name before, but now see how important he was to space history. People love how the video mixes personal family memories and technical stories. One person says the line “but for me...he was my dad” is very touching. Others mention how Bickler’s work inspired them to become engineers or follow the Mars rover missions. Some wish that more people knew about the people behind big space projects, not just the machines themselves. A few commenters share stories about their own work in space or engineering, feeling proud to be part of the same tradition. There are also thanks to the creator for sharing this story and making Bickler’s work known. Overall, most people agree that the video is one of the best they have seen on YouTube, both because of the story and the way it is told.
