This article is a secret manual from 1944, made by the US Office of Strategic Services, giving instructions on how everyday people can use simple sabotage to slow down enemy forces during war. The manual explains that sabotage does not need special tools or training—any person can do small things to damage the enemy’s efforts, often using normal objects from home or work, like salt, nails, or candles.

The manual says there are two main types of simple sabotage. The first is physical destruction, like starting fires, breaking machines, or ruining fuel and oil. The second type is more about behavior, like being uncooperative, making bad decisions on purpose, or causing confusion and delays at work. These actions, if done by many people, can waste enemy resources, slow down production, and make the enemy’s life harder.

It gives many examples: letting tools become dull, putting sand or sugar in engines, starting fires in warehouses, jamming locks, and causing trouble with trains, cars, and communication systems. It even suggests ways to make meetings and organizations less effective, like insisting on lots of paperwork, making decisions slowly, or starting arguments over small details.

People are encouraged to act in small, easy-to-hide ways so they don’t get caught. The manual says it’s important for citizen-saboteurs to feel like they are part of a bigger group, even if they work alone, so they stay motivated. It also says using humor and giving clear, simple reasons for sabotage can help people overcome any fear or hesitation.

Many actions are designed to look like honest mistakes, so the saboteur can avoid blame. Acts can be as simple as giving wrong directions, leaving out important materials, or working slowly and pretending to be confused.

In the Hacker News comments, some people found the manual fascinating and even funny, especially the parts about making organizations less efficient by holding long meetings or arguing over small rules. They said it’s surprising how many of these sabotage techniques still happen today in offices, but now it’s usually by accident, not on purpose.

Others pointed out that some ideas, like damaging machines or starting fires, are dangerous and could hurt innocent people. They warned that these actions, if used today, could be considered crimes or even terrorism.

A few commenters joked that some modern companies seem to follow this manual by accident, especially when there is lots of bureaucracy or when managers slow down work with too many rules and meetings. Some even wondered if today’s bad office habits come from these old sabotage ideas.

Some readers said the manual is a good reminder to keep organizations simple and efficient, so it is harder for mistakes—accidental or not—to slow things down. Others were interested in the history and asked if similar manuals exist for other countries.

A few people were surprised that the manual was made public by the CIA and thought it is useful to learn how small actions from many people can make a big difference, both in war and in normal life. Some warned that sharing these ideas could be risky, but most agreed it’s an interesting look into the past.

## What came first: the CNAME or the A record?

- 原文链接: [What came first: the CNAME or the A record?](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cname-a-record-order-dns-standards/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46681611)

This article explains how a small change to Cloudflare’s DNS server, 1.1.1.1, caused DNS problems for many users in January 2026. The trouble started when Cloudflare changed how CNAME and A records were ordered in DNS responses to save memory.

In DNS, a CNAME record is like a nickname for another domain, and an A record points a domain to an IP address. When you visit a website, your computer might follow several CNAME records before it finds the final A record with the right IP. Cloudflare’s code used to put all CNAME records at the top of the DNS answer, followed by the A record. But after the update, CNAMEs were sometimes placed at the end. This confused some DNS clients—software that figures out which IP address belongs to a name—because they expected CNAMEs to come first. For example, the Linux function getaddrinfo and some Cisco switches could not handle the new order. As a result, some websites stopped working, and some devices even crashed or rebooted.

Not all DNS clients had this problem. Newer systems like systemd-resolved are smarter: they look through all the DNS records and do not care about order. But older or simpler clients process records one by one and give up if things are not in the expected order.

The DNS protocol (written in RFC 1034 from 1987) does not clearly say if CNAMEs must come first. The rule says CNAMEs should “possibly preface” the answer, but it is not a strict requirement. Modern rules use stronger language like “MUST” or “SHOULD,” but the old RFC did not. This means some people read the rule one way, and others read it another way. Later updates to DNS rules, like for DNSSEC, are more clear, but for plain DNS this is still a gray area.

Because real software depends on CNAMEs coming first, Cloudflare decided to put things back the old way and will not change record order again. They are also working on a new rule to make it official that CNAMEs should come before other records in DNS answers.

In the comment section, some readers said this is a great example of how old software and unclear rules can break the Internet in strange ways. Others pointed out that the RFC is not clear, so both Cloudflare and the clients are right and wrong at the same time. Some developers said this shows why it’s risky to change things in old protocols, even for small improvements. A few people felt the real problem is that stub resolvers (like glibc on Linux) are not following the RFC’s advice to restart queries when they see a CNAME; instead, they rely on record order. Other readers argued that DNS needs better, clear rules, because too much software is built on old, unclear ideas. There were also comments from DNS experts who described how fixing these old habits is hard, since some devices never get updates. Some people suggested that new DNS features (like DNSSEC) should be designed much more carefully. A few were surprised that such a small change could break big things, like Cisco switches. Others said this is why big companies need very careful testing before changing anything. Finally, several readers thanked Cloudflare for being open about the problem and sharing what they learned so others can avoid similar bugs.

## Notes on Apple's Nano Texture (2025)

- 原文链接: [Notes on Apple's Nano Texture (2025)](https://jon.bo/posts/nano-texture/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46682518)

Apple’s Nano Texture is a new screen option for MacBook Pro laptops that helps reduce glare from bright lights and sunlight. The article explains how this screen makes it much easier to use a laptop in places like coffee shops, offices with strong lights, or even outdoors.

The Nano Texture works by etching tiny patterns onto the glass. This surface scatters light, so you don’t see as many reflections as you do with normal glossy screens. The writer says that since getting this screen, they no longer worry about where to sit indoors or outdoors—they can work almost anywhere. For people who code or write, this means being able to work outside or in sunny rooms without struggling to see the screen. The display comes with a special cleaning cloth, and you must use it instead of a regular microfiber cloth. Smudges and fingerprints show up more and are harder to clean, especially when outside. Also, black text on a white background (light mode) is much easier to read than white text on a black background (dark mode).

The article compares this MacBook to the Daylight Computer, a tablet with a special screen that works well in direct sunlight. The Daylight Computer uses a transflective LCD, which is grayscale and works without a backlight in sunlight, saving battery. The MacBook, on the other hand, needs its backlight on to see the screen at all. Still, the Nano Texture MacBook is great because you can work outside and still enjoy full color and high resolution, unlike the grayscale Daylight Computer. Both devices are said to be much better for outdoor computing than what was possible a year ago.

There are some downsides. The Nano Texture upgrade costs $150 extra. The screen is more high-maintenance: smudges are very visible, and you need to use the special cloth to clean it. You also have to be careful about scratching or damaging the surface, and even closing the laptop can sometimes leave marks. The writer is more worried about damaging this screen than with older models. If you have messy hands or work in a chaotic place, this screen may not be for you.

In the Hacker News comments, many people agree that glare is a big problem with modern glossy screens, especially when working outside or near windows. Some users say anti-glare coatings from the past were easier to care for, though they didn’t look as nice. Others feel the Nano Texture is too expensive and high-maintenance for most people. Some worry about how long the Nano Texture will last and if cleaning problems will get worse over time. A few commenters mention that they would rather see more companies make matte screens, not just Apple. Some people like the idea of working outside more often and see this as a big step forward. Others think the cleaning cloth rule is a bit too much for a laptop. There is also discussion about whether this improvement is worth the extra money, especially for users who don’t move around much or already work in places with good lighting. Some mention that the scratches and smudges are not unique to Nano Texture—other MacBook screens get them too, but they might show up more with this new finish. Finally, a few users share tips for keeping any laptop screen clean and safe, no matter which kind you use.

## Understanding C++ Ownership System

- 原文链接: [Understanding C++ Ownership System](https://blog.aiono.dev/posts/understanding-c++-ownership-system.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46683752)

This article talks about how C++ manages the ownership of objects—who is responsible for creating and destroying them, and how C++ is different from languages with garbage collection. The writer explains that in C++, you must think carefully about who owns data and when it should be cleaned up, or else you can run into bugs and memory leaks.

The article says ownership in C++ is not just one rule, but a group of ideas: creating and destroying objects, holding references, and moving or transferring ownership. For example, when a function returns a pointer, you must know if you should delete it or not. In garbage collected languages, this is handled for you, but in C++, you must be careful.

C++ uses a system called RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization). This means objects are created and destroyed along with the variables that own them. When a variable goes out of scope, its destructor runs, cleaning up any resources. This helps prevent memory leaks, especially when exceptions happen, because destructors are always called.

Instead of using raw pointers and manual `delete`, modern C++ uses smart pointers like `unique_ptr`. These automatically free memory when they go out of scope, making the code safer and easier to read. The article also shows how destructors work and why you must write them carefully to avoid leaks.

The idea of object lifetime is important: a reference must not outlive the object it points to, or you get undefined behavior. The article gives an example where a reference becomes invalid after the object it points to is destroyed, which can cause hard-to-find bugs.

The article also explains move semantics. This allows you to transfer resources from one object to another without copying everything, which is useful for performance. For example, when growing a vector, you can “move” objects from the old buffer to the new one, instead of copying. The function `std::move` is used for this, and the article explains that it just changes the type of reference, letting C++ choose a different function that can steal resources.

Finally, the article says that while C++ ownership may look complicated, it is a set of rules working together. Knowing these helps you write safer, faster programs.

In the comments, many readers agree that understanding ownership is key to using C++ well. Some people say they struggled with manual memory management when moving from garbage collected languages. A few mention that smart pointers and RAII have made modern C++ much easier and safer than before. Others point out that even with these tools, you still need to be careful with object lifetimes and references, as mistakes can lead to crashes or security problems.

There are comments explaining that move semantics can be confusing at first, but they are important for writing efficient code. Some readers wish C++ had more language-level help, like Rust, to prevent mistakes with ownership and lifetime. A few people say that C++'s flexibility is both its strength and its weakness: you can do almost anything, but it’s easy to get it wrong.

One comment highlights that many bugs in big projects come from not following ownership rules. Another says that learning about RAII and smart pointers was a "lightbulb moment" for them. Some readers share tips, like always using smart pointers unless you have a good reason not to, or writing clear comments about who owns what.

A few people discuss how different companies have their own guidelines for ownership in C++, and share links to more resources. Others mention that even experienced C++ developers sometimes get ownership wrong, so it's important to keep learning and reviewing code.

Overall, the comments show that ownership in C++ is a big topic, but knowing the basics helps avoid many common problems.

## Nearly a third of social media research has undisclosed ties to industry

- 原文链接: [Nearly a third of social media research has undisclosed ties to industry](https://www.science.org/content/article/nearly-third-social-media-research-has-undisclosed-ties-industry-preprint-claims)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46682534)

A new report says almost one-third of social media research does not reveal connections to the companies being studied. The article looks at how many academic papers about social media have hidden or undisclosed financial links to industry, like Facebook or Twitter.

The researchers checked many studies on social media. They found that about 30% had some kind of industry tie, but did not say so clearly. These ties could be money, data access, or other help from companies. Sometimes, researchers get early access to platform data, or funding for their work, but do not mention it in their published papers. This is a problem because readers may not know about possible bias. The article says that open disclosure is important for trust. Some social media companies have rules for sharing data, and this can pressure researchers to work with them. There are calls for clearer rules and better checks by journals. The report is still a preprint, so it is not yet peer-reviewed. Still, it raises big questions about transparency in tech research.

In the comments, some people are not surprised by these findings. They say industry money is common in tech research. Others worry that hidden ties make it hard to trust results, especially when the topic is something as powerful as social media. A few users argue that without industry help, research would be much slower or even impossible, because companies control the data. Some think the real problem is with journals and universities for not checking disclosures carefully. Others point out that sometimes researchers may not even realize all the ways they are influenced by industry. There are ideas for stronger disclosure rules and more independent studies. Some people are worried this is a wider issue, not just with social media research, but with all tech research. A few say that preprint findings should be read with care, since the work is not yet peer-reviewed. Overall, many agree that more openness would help everyone trust the science more.

## Graphics In Flatland – 2D ray tracing [video]

- 原文链接: [Graphics In Flatland – 2D ray tracing [video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYTOykSqf2Y)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46649781)

This video shows how 2D ray tracing works in a web browser, using a tool made by the creator. Ray tracing is a graphics method that simulates how light moves and bounces, but here it is limited to two dimensions, like in the world of Flatland.

The video starts by explaining what ray tracing is: you send out lines (rays) from a light source, and these lines bounce off objects like walls or mirrors. In 2D, rays move in straight lines on a flat surface and change direction when they hit objects, following the rules for reflection. The creator made a demo where you can place walls and mirrors, then see how rays from a light source travel and bounce around the space. You can try this demo online, and the code is open source on GitHub. The video also suggests a book called “The Ray Tracer Challenge” for those who want to learn more. The creator thanks the Recurse Center for support and gives credit for some images used in the video.

Ray tracing is usually done in 3D, but this project makes it easier to see and understand by showing everything in 2D. The flat view helps people follow the path of each ray. The demo is interactive, so you can change the setup and instantly see how the light behaves. This can help students or anyone curious about optics and computer graphics. The code is written to run in the browser, so no installation is needed. This makes it easy to share and use. The project combines programming, math, and art in a simple way.

In the comments, one viewer says the explanation is very clear and easy to follow. Another person shares that they tried to make something similar in high school but could not finish, and they are happy to see someone succeed. A third commenter simply says the project is lovely, showing they enjoyed it. All comments are positive and show support for the work. No one points out problems or asks hard questions. The creator “liked” all the comments, showing they read and appreciated them. The discussion is friendly and encouraging, and people enjoy seeing graphics made simple. Some viewers might want more technical details, but most just like the clear demo and the idea. The project inspires others to try making their own visual tools. It also shows that computer graphics can be fun and not too hard to start with.

## Show HN: Subth.ink – write something and see how many others wrote the same

- 原文链接: [Show HN: Subth.ink – write something and see how many others wrote the same](https://subth.ink/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46682732)

This article talks about a website called subth.ink, where you can write a thought and see if others have written the same thing. The site lets you enter up to 256 characters, and it checks if your exact sentence matches thoughts from other people.

The system does not save your actual words. Instead, it makes a secret code (called a hash) from your text, using SHA256 with some extra random data (salt). It also makes another code (MD5 hash) without the extra data, but it does not show this code to users now. In the future, if a thought is very popular, the MD5 code might be made public, which could let people guess what the original thought was, especially if it is short. The website is anonymous, so no one knows who wrote which thought.

You can use the website in your browser, or you can use a command line tool (CLI) by sending your thought with a simple curl command. The site also shows the top “thoughts” by how many times people wrote the same thing, but instead of showing the sentences, it only shows their code (hash) and a count for each.

There is a simple API. You can send your thought, and it will tell you how many times that thought has been sent before. You can also get a list of the most common thoughts, again by their code and count, not by the text itself.

People in the comments liked the simple idea and privacy focus. Some said it could be fun to see if their thoughts are unique or common. Others worried that if the unsalted MD5 codes are ever made public, it might not be fully private, since short or common thoughts could be guessed with computer programs. A few users wanted to see the actual words of popular thoughts, not just the hashes, but others said this could be a privacy risk.

Some people liked the command line access and the easy API. Others thought the site was a nice social experiment, while a few said it might not be very useful for serious things. There were questions about possible abuse, like spam or offensive thoughts, but since the actual text is not stored, this risk is low. One person suggested using this tool to check if an idea is really as unique as you think. Another person said it is a good way to show how hashes work for beginners. Some thought the site could be improved with search or more ways to explore the data. Overall, the comments showed both excitement and some concerns about privacy and usefulness.

## Fix macOS 26 (Tahoe) exaggerated rounded corners

- 原文链接: [Fix macOS 26 (Tahoe) exaggerated rounded corners](https://github.com/makalin/CornerFix)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46683589)

This article is about a small app called CornerFix, made for people who do not like the new rounded corners in macOS 26 (Tahoe). Starting with this macOS version, Apple made the display corners much more curved, and many users feel it looks odd or distracting.

CornerFix is a menu bar app that lets you add “caps” to the screen’s corners. These caps make the display look like it has sharp, straight edges again, just like before. The app does not change the shape of your app windows—it only affects the very edge of the screen. The overlays are always on top but do not block your clicks, so you can use your computer as usual. You can change the size of the caps, pick their color (even make them match your wallpaper), and use the app across multiple monitors. There’s also an auto color mode that matches your system’s dark or light theme. The app is easy to turn on or off and safe to use because it does not mess with system files or require special permissions.

To use CornerFix, you need macOS 13 or newer and Xcode 15 or higher. The app is open source and uses the MIT license, so anyone can see and change the code. The developer suggests custom color mode for tricky wallpapers. There is a note that if another app draws something above the screen saver level, the overlay might not always be visible.

In the Hacker News comments, some users are happy to see this tool because they strongly dislike the new rounded corners and feel it breaks the clean look of their screens. Others think the rounded corners are a small thing and do not see why it matters. A few people joke about how much time developers spend fixing tiny design choices from big companies like Apple. Some users like the approach of using overlays instead of hacking the system, saying it is much safer and easier to update. Others mention that this kind of tool shows how small annoyances can lead to creative solutions. There are also comments about Apple not giving users a choice to turn off the new look, which frustrates some. A few users share tips on matching the cap color to their wallpaper for best results. Some question if overlays can cause problems with other apps, but most agree that CornerFix’s method is smart and low-risk. Overall, the community seems split—some care a lot about screen corners, while others do not, but many respect the effort put into this project.

## Show HN: A creative coding library for making art with desktop windows

- 原文链接: [Show HN: A creative coding library for making art with desktop windows](https://github.com/willmeyers/window-art)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46683858)

This article is about a Python library called “window-art” that lets you make moving art on your desktop by creating and controlling windows. The tool is small and made for people who want to live-code visual scenes—meaning you can write code and see windows move, change color, fade, or display text and images in real time.

You can install the library with `pip install window-art`. To use it, you import the library and open a “run” block. Inside, you can create windows at any spot on your screen with a color, image, video, or text. You can move a window from one place to another, change its color, fade it in or out, and even show pictures or play videos inside the windows. For example, you can make a red box, move it across the screen, then turn it blue. You can also make windows show “Hello!” in big letters or display a photo or movie. Each action, like moving or fading, has a time value so you can chain them together and control how things look. The code is short and easy to read, so it’s nice for quick experiments or demos.

The project is new, with only a few stars on GitHub. It is open source and uses the MIT license. The creator says it is for “minimal” live coding, which means it tries to keep things simple. There are example codes and a small website for more info.

In the Hacker News comments, some people think the idea is fun and say it reminds them of older days when making art with windows was common. A few users are excited to try it for live shows or music performances. Others ask technical questions, like how the windows are drawn or if the tool works on all systems. Some worry that too many windows could slow down a computer or cause problems with window managers. One person suggests adding sound support, while another says it could be a good tool for teaching coding. There is some talk about similar projects in other languages, and a few users mention that this could be used for playful pranks or to make screensavers. But a couple of people don’t see a real use case and wonder if it’s just a toy. Overall, the comments mix curiosity, nostalgia, and ideas for more uses.

## From Nevada to Kansas by Glider

- 原文链接: [From Nevada to Kansas by Glider](https://www.weglide.org/flight/978820)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46641036)

This story is about Gordon Boettger and Bruce Campbell flying a glider from Nevada to Kansas, covering 1,112 miles in one day. The flight started at Minden-Tahoe and ended at Dodge City Regional Airport, taking over 12 hours.

Gordon had dreamed of this adventure for 40 years. He needed a whole team to help, including his wife, friends, and air traffic controllers (ATC). The flight used a special glider called Arcus J and followed a careful plan. They watched the weather for a rare wind pattern that made the flight possible. Gordon used a tool called SKYSIGHT to find places where the air would lift the glider. The flight started very early, around 3 am, with strong crosswinds and cold air. Ice formed on the inside of the cockpit, making it hard to see, especially while using night vision goggles.

The most difficult part was crossing the Rocky Mountains. The glider had to climb slowly and wait for the right air currents. ATC was very helpful, allowing them to change their path when needed. When they reached the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, they found strong updrafts and knew they could finish. Other pilots and airline crews were surprised to hear a glider was flying so high and so far. After reaching the highest allowed altitude, they made a long glide to Dodge City, passing through different air traffic zones. Gordon felt overjoyed and thanked everyone who helped.

In the comments, many people congratulated Gordon and Bruce. Some were amazed by the teamwork and planning. Others pointed out the value of good weather prediction tools like SKYSIGHT. A few people shared links to interviews with Gordon about the flight. Some comments focused on the technical parts, like the glider model and flight planning. Others admired the support from ATC and how rare such flights are. A few users said this story inspired them to learn more about soaring. Some asked questions about night flying and safety. Overall, the community showed a lot of respect and excitement for this record-breaking journey.
