Hello everyone, this is the 2025-08-18 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we bring you stories about new tools for developers, tech job opportunities, classic games, and even a look at world history. Let’s get started.

First, Obsidian, the popular note-taking app, has released a new tool called "Bases." This plugin lets you turn your notes into a kind of database. With Bases, you can organize projects, travel plans, or reading lists more easily. You create a base, which is a group of notes you can manage together. You can switch between list and table views, filter your notes, add special properties, and use different layouts. There’s even support for formulas, so you can sum numbers or sort notes right inside Obsidian. The syntax is simple, and there are help pages if you get stuck. Everything works within Obsidian, so you don’t need to learn a new app. It’s friendly even if you’re not a programmer, letting you quickly link notes and filter what you need. People on Hacker News are excited. Some think Bases could replace tools like Notion or Airtable for simple tasks. Others are happy because their notes stay private and local. Some users worry about learning new syntax or about performance with lots of notes. A few want more advanced features, like linking between bases or better mobile support. But most people feel Bases is a solid addition that will help them stay organized.

Next, a small team set out to build a developer tool for using AI, but their project changed and became a Sims-style game instead. In this game, you control a character in a virtual office, interact with objects, and complete tasks, much like The Sims. Instead of coding directly, you guide your character to work, talk to AI coworkers, and manage projects by clicking and choosing actions. The game uses cartoon graphics and simple controls. You can see your goals, pick up items, and even hold meetings with AI teammates. The creators say the game-like interface made the tool more fun and easier to use, showing how AI can help with daily developer work. Some game parts are puzzles—you need to figure out the best way to solve tasks or keep your team happy. A video walkthrough shows how to move around, start projects, and use AI helpers. Responses on Hacker News are mixed. Some people like the playful idea, saying it might help new developers learn or make boring work more fun. Others worry that a game interface could slow down real programmers or hide important details. A few joke about “gamifying” everything and wonder if this is just a toy. Some want the tool to be more open or customizable. Most agree it’s a creative idea, even if it won’t replace normal code editors soon. People are interested to see where it goes next.

Now let’s talk about Whispering, an open-source app that lets you turn your speech into text on your own device. You press a shortcut, speak, and your words are quickly transcribed and copied to your clipboard. Whispering focuses on privacy: your data stays on your computer unless you choose a cloud service, and then you use your own API keys. It runs on Mac, Windows, Linux, and even in your browser. You can choose between many transcription providers, like Groq, OpenAI, ElevenLabs, or use local offline transcription for free. There’s no vendor lock-in, and the code is open source, so you can see how it works. The app is small, fast, and uses little memory. You can set up custom workflows—fix grammar, translate, summarize, or format your text. All settings are stored locally. You only pay for the cloud API you use, or nothing if you use local transcription. Features include voice-activated mode, custom keyboard shortcuts, and strong privacy controls. It’s built with Svelte, Tauri, and Rust, and is easy to install. Many people on Hacker News like the privacy focus, the open code, and the cross-platform support. Some have already switched from paid tools to Whispering. A few want even more offline features. Some discuss adding more providers, languages, or better voice detection. The creator explains it’s best for short dictations, not long recordings. Users like the clear install steps and the easy setup for non-technical people. Some want to help contribute. Overall, Whispering is seen as a strong tool that gives users more control over speech-to-text.

In hardware news, a team has built a very simple, open-source version of a tensor processing unit, or TPU, inspired by Google’s chips. Their goal was to learn hardware by creating a TPU design anyone can study. The heart of their TPU is a “systolic array,” a grid of small units that multiply and add numbers—just what’s needed for neural networks. Data moves across the grid in special ways, and results are collected after passing through the array. A separate unit adds biases, runs activation functions like leaky ReLU, and calculates losses. All data is stored in a unified buffer for fast access. The control unit runs everything using a custom instruction set. The team explains how to add new modules, run tests, and view results. They hope to build a compiler and make bigger TPUs later. Everything is open source, and they welcome help. Hacker News users are excited to see an open TPU, since Google’s are secret. Some think it’s a good learning tool, while others point out it’s not as fast or large as commercial TPUs. Questions include whether it can run real machine learning models, how the instruction set works, and how well it scales. Some suggest more guides or videos to help beginners. Most agree that open hardware like this is valuable for learning and the community.

Now to a post about programming languages and code editors. The article explains how some languages make it hard for code editors to help you as you type, because of their syntax. For example, in Python, when you write a list comprehension, the editor doesn’t know what variables mean until you finish the whole expression. This means you don’t get autocomplete or suggestions until it’s too late. In Rust, you can write code step by step, and the editor can always help you, since each step is valid code. The author says programming should be like a good user interface, where you only see the options you need at each step. The article also compares to C, where you have to remember function names without help from the editor, and to JavaScript, where you can type part of a word and get suggestions. On Hacker News, some agree that left-to-right, method-chaining styles help with autocomplete, while others say list comprehensions are very readable with practice. Some think better editors could help no matter the syntax. Others point out that every language has trade-offs, and that Python is designed for readability, not just for editor support. There are also jokes about every programmer wanting their favorite language to work like their second favorite. In the end, people agree making code easier to write and read is a good goal, but there’s no perfect answer.

Next, let’s look at ScrollGuard, a new app that helps people block short video content like YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels. It also lets you set time limits for scrolling in any app. ScrollGuard blocks Shorts and Reels on Instagram, Facebook, Reddit, and YouTube. It has a feature called "antiscroll mode" to limit scrolling time, and promises no ads. The main idea is to help people avoid “doom-scrolling”—endless watching of short videos—and give users more control over their time and mental health. The app is simple and only on Android for now, but plans to help both adults and young people. In the comments, users share their struggles with short videos and say they need help controlling habits. Some wonder if the app will work long-term, or if people will find ways around it. Others ask about the technical side—how the app blocks content and if it could come to iOS. People like that there are no ads and privacy is a focus. Some suggest more features like time reports or more customization. Others say blocking content is not enough, and social media companies should do more. Overall, ScrollGuard is seen as a useful tool for people who want to avoid wasting time on social media.

For those looking for jobs, Spice Data is hiring a new graduate as a Product Associate in San Francisco. The company provides restaurant data to big businesses and is backed by Y Combinator. The role involves cleaning and standardizing data, working with outside contractors, and improving data processes with engineers. It’s in-person four days a week, and they want someone who is organized and a good communicator. The salary is $80,000 to $100,000, plus equity and benefits like lunch and unlimited paid time off. The interview process is clear: an intro call, two interviews, then an onsite visit. Spice Data is small and profitable, which some commenters say means more learning and responsibility. Others question if new grads can handle talking to clients, but responses say these are valuable skills to learn early. Some people wonder about the company’s long-term growth, but others think there could be more opportunities in the future. Most comments are positive, saying it’s a strong opportunity for new grads who want to start in tech and data.

Now for a story from game history. Minh Le, a college student, made the first version of Counter-Strike in his dorm room. His hobby game became a huge hit, with over 100,000 players and earning him and his partner over $20,000 each month from ads. Counter-Strike was released by Valve in 2000 and became one of the most famous shooting games ever, helping start the esports industry. Minh’s early interest in computers and “modding”—changing existing games—helped him learn the skills he needed. The simple but deep design of Counter-Strike made it popular for years. On Hacker News, many are inspired by Minh’s story and say modding is a great way for beginners to learn programming and game design. Some worry that today’s games are harder to mod, making it tougher for new developers. There’s also debate about the money made from selling cosmetic skins in games. Some users point out that big companies now control mods more, which can limit new ideas. But most agree that Counter-Strike’s story shows how passion and creativity can make a big difference, even from a dorm room.

For those interested in low-level programming, there’s a GitHub project called "FFmpeg Assembly Language Lessons." It helps people learn to write assembly code for FFmpeg, a popular video and audio software. The lessons are for people who know C and some math, and want to understand how things work closer to the hardware. The lessons start simple and move to more complex topics, with plans for assignments. The project is open source and has lessons in English, French, and Spanish. There’s a Discord server for help. On Hacker News, people say this is a great resource, since good assembly tutorials are rare, especially for real projects. Some say learning assembly helps you understand computers better, even if you don’t use it daily. Others warn that modern compilers are very good, so hand-written assembly is only needed in special cases. Some like the translations, and a few want more exercises or support for other architectures. Many are just happy to see FFmpeg sharing internal knowledge with the community.

Finally, a story about Sikkim, a small kingdom in the Himalayas, and its place in the conflicts between India, Pakistan, and China in the 1960s. The article describes how Sikkim’s location made it important during the Indo-Pakistan War of 1965, when China and India faced off near its border. Sikkim had its own king and some independence, but also signed a treaty with India. The region became a base for secret CIA operations supporting Tibetan rebels. In 1963, Sikkim’s prince married an American, making the tiny kingdom famous. During the 1965 war, China sent troops near Sikkim, raising fears of a bigger war. The US, busy with Vietnam, tried to calm things down. In the end, Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire, but the crisis showed how small countries can get caught between big powers. India later took control of Sikkim in 1975, ending its independence. In the comments, some readers say Sikkim’s story shows the danger for small states caught between stronger neighbors. Others discuss the Cold War’s effect on local conflicts. There are personal stories and debate about whether outside powers helped or hurt stability. Some people feel sad that local voices were ignored, but note that Sikkim’s culture survived.

That’s all for today’s episode. Thank you for listening to Hacker News Daily Podcast. See you next time.
