NASA has managed to keep the Voyager 1 spacecraft, launched in 1977, working by reviving its old thrusters. This is a big win for NASA's team, as these thrusters hadn't worked since 2004. The problem was that fuel lines of the backup thrusters were getting clogged, which could have led to the spacecraft losing its ability to communicate with Earth. NASA engineers figured out that the heaters for these thrusters might still work because of a possible circuit disturbance. They took the risk to power them up, and it worked, saving Voyager 1 from drifting out of contact.

In the Hacker News comments, many people were amazed by the engineering feat. Some users mentioned the huge pressure on the team, as a failure could have ended the mission. Others talked about the excitement and tension of waiting for signals from Voyager, which takes 46 hours round trip. There was also a discussion on how incredible it is that we can update a 50-year-old spacecraft over such a long distance. Some commenters reflected on NASA's history of overcoming long odds, while others appreciated the sense of human curiosity and achievement the mission represents. There was also a bit of nostalgia, with some users expressing sadness at the thought of eventually losing contact with Voyager 1.

## The first year of free-threaded Python

- 原文链接: [The first year of free-threaded Python](https://labs.quansight.org/blog/free-threaded-one-year-recap)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44003445)

The article talks about the first year of free-threaded Python, which aims to improve Python's use of modern hardware by removing the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). This change allows Python programs to run more efficiently on multicore CPUs and GPUs. However, it's not simple, as packages with compiled code need auditing to avoid thread-safety issues that the GIL once prevented.

The removal of the GIL required major changes to the CPython interpreter. Packages that use global state must now ensure thread safety since the GIL no longer protects against data races. Quansight, along with Meta, worked on making many Python packages compatible with free-threading, including tools like NumPy and pandas. They also improved thread safety in Python's `warnings` and `asyncio` modules and optimized the garbage collector for free-threaded Python. A comprehensive guide was created to help others update their packages for free-threading.

In the comments, there are mixed feelings. Some users worry about the complexity of multithreaded code and potential bugs as Python transitions away from the GIL. Others are excited about the performance improvements, particularly for CPU-bound tasks. A few commenters note that spawning Python processes can be slow, and free-threading might help reduce this overhead. However, there's concern about existing code breaking, especially code written without considering multithreading. Some users believe Python should focus on improving single-threaded performance first. Overall, while the change is seen as positive, there's an understanding that it will take time for the ecosystem to fully adapt.
