Hello everyone, this is the 2026-02-19 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have a lot of interesting stories for software developers and tech fans. Let’s get started.

First, Google just announced Gemini 3.1 Pro, their newest AI model for hard and complex tasks. This update is coming out for developers, businesses, and regular users through the Gemini API, Vertex AI, the Gemini app, and NotebookLM. Gemini 3.1 Pro is much better at reasoning than before. For example, it scored 77.1% on the ARC-AGI-2 benchmark, which is much higher than the older version. This model can explain tough topics using clear visuals, collect data into easy views, and even write code for things like animated SVG images or creative websites. Some demos show Gemini 3.1 Pro building animated images from just text, making a live dashboard to track the International Space Station, and coding a 3D bird flock you can control with your hand. It can even turn the feeling of a book like "Wuthering Heights" into a modern website design.

Right now, Gemini 3.1 Pro is in “preview,” so Google can collect feedback and make it better before a full release. If you have a Pro or Ultra plan, you get higher limits and earlier access.

In the comments, people share many views. Some are excited about the big jump in reasoning skill and hope this means AI can help more with science or code. Others wonder if the high scores really match real-world use, or if Google picked easy tests. Privacy comes up too, with questions about how safe data is, especially for business users. Some developers say the API and tools are easy to use, but others want more open models and less “black box” behavior. While demo videos look great, some users warn that real projects often hit bugs or strange results. There’s excitement about creative uses for art and design, but others want stronger results on basic things like math or logic puzzles. Cost is also a worry—people hope better AI will not mean higher prices and want Google to keep improving speed and reliability.

Next, we have an article saying we should not think of AI as a coworker, but as an exoskeleton that makes workers stronger. The main idea is that AI should help people do their jobs better, not replace them. The article shares examples of real exoskeletons helping in factories, the military, healthcare, and even running. For example, at Ford factories, exoskeletons reduced injuries by 83%. Soldiers can carry more weight, but still decide where to go. In hospitals, people who could not walk can walk again with exoskeletons. These machines help people do more, but people stay in control.

Many companies hope AI can act as an agent and do jobs by itself, but this often fails because AI does not know all the details about a company or product. The author’s company, Kasava, built an AI platform that helps people find patterns and problems in code, calls, and data. But the AI does not make final decisions—humans do. Kasava uses a “product graph,” a map of all the information about a product. Some of this comes from code and project history, and some from people telling the AI what matters. Together, this helps teams make better choices. The AI gives extra “strength” for thinking, but humans stay in charge.

The advice is to break jobs into smaller tasks and use AI to help with the boring or hard parts, like writing code comments or searching for problems. Let people make the big decisions. Build small AI tools that do one thing well and let people see what the AI is doing. This makes it easier to fix problems if something goes wrong.

In the comments, many people say they like the exoskeleton idea. Some share stories about AI tools that help with small tasks, but they still want control. Others warn that using AI to cut jobs can cause problems when the AI makes mistakes or does not know the real situation. Some think AI may do more by itself one day, but for now, it is better as a helper. The “exoskeleton” model is seen as safe because people stay in charge, but it needs good design so people know what the AI is doing. There are also worries about companies using AI as a full replacement, which can upset employees and get poor results. Some readers like the idea of “micro-agents”—small, focused AI tools—because they are easier to trust and fix. Overall, most agree that AI works best as a tool to help people, not as an independent worker. Keeping humans “in the loop” is important for good results.

Moving on, we have a story about Micasa, a tool that helps you track everything about your home from the command line. It works in your terminal, stores data in a single SQLite file, and does not use the cloud or need an account. You can track home maintenance, projects, incidents, appliances, vendors, quotes, and documents. For example, you can see when you last changed a furnace filter, plan projects, compare quotes, track appliance warranties, and link problems to vendors. All documents are stored inside the SQLite file. Micasa runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows, and setup is easy. The interface uses Vim-style keys so you can browse, edit, sort, and search with your keyboard. The tool was made because the creator was tired of tracking home stuff with random receipts and sticky notes.

In the comments, some people love the idea of a local, terminal-based tracker that does not need the cloud. Others want mobile or web support. Many praise the privacy because data stays on your computer, but some worry about losing the file. Some users ask if it can be used for office assets, and the answer is yes. There are praises for the Vim-style controls, but some wish for mouse support. A few people already use spreadsheets, but like how Micasa puts everything together. There are questions about syncing across devices, and the answer is you can use syncing tools, but there is no built-in sync. Open source is another plus, but some wonder if non-technical users will find it hard. Many thank the creator for solving a real problem in a simple way.

Next, let’s talk about micropayments—small, quick payments that could help news sites make money in a world where people read from many sources. The writer explains that now, people read many articles from different places, but often do not pay for subscriptions, so news sites lose money. Micropayments could let readers pay a little for each article and turn small bits of attention into income for news sites. This would not replace ads, but add another way for sites to show advertisers that real people are reading.

Mobile games already use micropayments by having users buy coins first, then use them for items. This two-step process makes spending money feel easier and could work for news too. If even half of readers paid for some articles, sites would have better records for advertisers. But, if sites switch to micropayments, some subscribers might cancel and only pay for a few articles, cutting income. One idea is to give coins to subscribers as a bonus, like games do.

The article warns that big tech companies try to control how ads are measured, hurting independent news sites. Micropayment data could help, but news sites need to move fast.

In the comments, some think micropayments will never work because people are used to free content and do not want to make small payments. Others say even if the system is smoother, it still feels like work to pay each time. Some point out that big tech firms have too much power. Some like the idea, saying it could help fight fake news by showing which sites have real, paying readers. Others worry it could make news harder to get for people with little money or who read from many sites. There are concerns about more pop-ups or steps before reading, which could annoy users. Some suggest giving free coins to get people started, or bundling micropayments into browser tools. Most agree there are many problems to solve before micropayments can save news sites.

Now, we have a post about “cmux,” a terminal app for macOS based on Ghostty, with special features for AI coding agents. It helps you work with many coding agents and get clear notifications inside your terminal. Cmux lets you organize work using vertical tabs in a sidebar, showing info like your git branch, folder, open ports, and the latest message for each tab. When an AI agent, like Claude Code, needs your attention, you see a blue ring and the tab lights up. There’s a notification panel and a shortcut to jump to the latest unread message.

A big feature is the built-in browser. You can open a browser pane next to your terminal and use it with scripts, so AI agents can click, fill forms, or check your dev server. Cmux is scriptable with CLI or a socket API to make new tabs, split panes, send keys, or control the browser. It is a real macOS app written in Swift and AppKit, so it is fast and uses little memory. It uses your Ghostty config for themes and GPU for drawing.

In the comments, some people like the idea of vertical tabs and built-in notifications, saying it solves real problems when working with many AI agents or coding sessions. Others ask how cmux is different from tools like tmux or iTerm2, and if it is really needed. Some prefer native apps over Electron, so they like that cmux is written in Swift. A few want to see versions for Linux or Windows. Some worry about learning new shortcuts or moving from tmux. There are questions about the scriptable browser and how it helps with coding agents. One person says notification rings and the panel could make multitasking with agents easier. Some feel AI-focused features are too specific, while others say the sidebar info helps all developers. Overall, people are interested, but want to try it themselves.

Next, we look at a weather app for the terminal that shows ASCII animations based on real-time weather. It uses Open-Meteo for live data and can display rain, snow, thunderstorms, airplanes, day/night cycles, and more. The app picks your location using your IP but you can set it by hand. You can install it with Rust’s Cargo, from the AUR, or with Nix flakes. There are many options: choose units, hide info, run in silent mode, or simulate weather for testing. Keyboard controls are simple, and it supports color or no color for accessibility. Your location can be private if you turn off auto-location. The code is open source under GPL-3.0, written mostly in Rust.

In the comments, many love seeing fun and useful terminal tools. Some praise the smooth ASCII animations. Others like that the app works without tracking users, as you can turn off auto-location. Some compare it to other weather tools like “wttr.in.” Developers want to see more weather types or shortcuts in the future. People like that it is cross-platform and open source. Some want Windows support. There are worries about using outside APIs for auto-location, but others like that it can work offline. Some want a plain text-only mode for old terminals. Most are excited and happy to see more creative terminal apps.

Now, let’s talk about archaeology. Scientists have found what may be the first direct evidence of Hannibal’s war elephants. Hannibal was a general from Carthage who led elephants across the Alps to fight Rome over 2,000 years ago. In this new discovery, scientists found a bone in Italy that comes from an African elephant, not a local European species. The bone was found at an old battle site where Hannibal’s army fought the Romans. This supports ancient stories that Hannibal used elephants in battle. Before this, there was no clear proof from the battle sites. Scientists used special tests to check the age and type of the bone, and it matches African elephants, which were rare in Europe. This finding helps us better understand ancient war history.

In the comments, people are excited about the discovery. Some say it is great to have physical proof for old stories. Others note that ancient writers could get details wrong. Some discuss how hard it must have been to move elephants over the Alps. There are questions about future finds and the science used to test the bone. Some debate how many elephants Hannibal really had or worry about animals in war. Many agree this is a big step for archaeology and history.

Next, we have an article about why many older people in America and Singapore wish they had saved more money for retirement. It compares the idea that people don’t save enough because they procrastinate, with a new idea that unexpected economic shocks—like job loss, health problems, or divorce—are the real reason for regret.

Research from surveys of people aged 60–74 in both countries shows that procrastination does not predict regret. What really matters is if someone had a big negative financial shock. In the US, 69% had at least one shock, compared to 46% in Singapore. Americans who had shocks were much more likely to regret not saving, especially with several shocks. In Singapore, regret stayed about the same no matter how many shocks. The difference comes from how each country’s systems work. Singapore forces people to save for retirement, health, and housing, giving safety nets before problems begin. The US has a weak unemployment system, and losing a job often means losing health insurance too, which can destroy savings.

The article also says Singaporeans still regret, but mostly because of the shock itself, not bad habits. People who are good at understanding risk and planning for uncertainty have less regret.

In the comments, many agree that life events, not just habits, make saving hard. Some share stories of how a single medical bill or job loss wiped out years of saving. Others say US systems are confusing and unfair. Some find forced saving in Singapore harsh, but agree having safety nets before trouble starts is better. Several discuss the limits of automatic enrollment and other “nudges”—these help, but cannot protect against big, unexpected problems. Some say the US could learn from Singapore’s approach. Others worry about over-relying on forced savings, especially for low-income people. A few stress the importance of teaching people to plan for risk, not just manage money. Overall, the discussion supports the article’s message: you cannot save your way out of every problem—sometimes, bigger systems need to help.

Now, we cover a story about America losing its best scientists to other countries. Fewer top students and researchers want to stay in the US or move there for work. In the past, America was a top place for science and technology, but now other countries like China and some in Europe are investing more in science and offering better jobs and support. Talented people are choosing to stay home or go elsewhere.

Examples show scientists leaving the US because work visas are hard to get, research money is difficult to find, and there is too much paperwork. Some feel there is more freedom and less stress outside the US. American universities and companies cannot find enough good people for important jobs, and if this continues, America may fall behind in technology and discoveries.

In the comments, some agree and say they have seen good scientists leave the US because the visa process is slow and research jobs do not pay enough. Others say America is still a great place for science, but problems are growing. Some say the US government should make it easier for skilled people to stay and work. Others point out that focusing too much on short-term profit hurts long-term science. Many agree that fixing visa rules and giving more support to research would help keep talented people in America.

Finally, let’s talk about Paged Out! Issue #8, a free digital magazine for hackers and programmers. This issue is the largest so far and adds a web viewer and clear deadlines for submissions. The magazine covers algorithms, security, AI, reverse engineering, digital hygiene, and creative coding tricks.

Articles include new algorithms for tile placement in games, query-based models in compilers, memory planning in PyTorch, and AI models moving around in video games. There are also pieces on large language models, using AI for cybersecurity, encoding data with playing cards, hiding information in zero-width Unicode, and more. Some articles show how to send secret data using audio tones from AWK scripts, work with B-trees, and look at the limits of “free software” with Signal as an example.

In the comments, readers praise the range and depth of topics. Many like the practical tricks and hands-on style. Some debate how useful certain security articles are, saying AI helps but cannot replace human review. Others discuss open-source topics and wish for easier access to article sources or translations. Some want more beginner-friendly summaries. Overall, the magazine is seen as inspiring, with a good balance of new research, fun hacks, and community spirit.
