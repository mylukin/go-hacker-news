- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45993296)

Google has launched Nano Banana Pro, a new image creation and editing AI model from DeepMind, based on Gemini 3 Pro. This tool is made to help people make accurate and creative images for things like infographics, posters, and storyboards, and it can also add readable text in many languages right inside the picture. Nano Banana Pro is better than old models because it uses real-world facts and better reasoning to make images that are helpful and up to date. You can use it to turn notes into diagrams, visualize data, or even show real-time info like weather and sports. The model is strong at making text look correct and clear, even for longer sentences, and can translate text to different languages for international use.

Nano Banana Pro can blend up to 14 images together, keep the look of up to 5 people in a photo, and help with things like changing the lighting or focus, adjusting camera angles, and making images in high resolutions (2K and 4K). Creative controls let you pick and change any part of an image, making it good for both quick edits and complex designs. The model is now available in the Gemini app, Google Ads, Workspace, and for developers through APIs and Google AI Studio.

To help people know when an image is AI-made, every image from Nano Banana Pro is marked with SynthID, a hidden digital watermark. There’s also a visible watermark for free and Pro users, but this is removed for Ultra subscribers and pro tools. You can even upload an image to the Gemini app to check if it was made by Google AI.

In the Hacker News comments, some users are excited about the better image quality and the fact that text is now clear and supports many languages. Others worry about how this could be used to make fake images or spread misinformation, but think SynthID and visible watermarks are helpful ideas. Some people like the creative tools for making storyboards and infographics, but a few think the name “Nano Banana Pro” is strange and might make the tool seem less serious. Developers are happy to see the model open for API use, but some ask about costs and limits for free users. There’s also talk about the watermark system—not everyone trusts that it will stop all misuse, and some wish there were more ways to tell if an image is AI-generated outside Google’s tools. Others compare it to similar tools from OpenAI and Adobe, saying competition is good and features like real-time info make this release interesting. A few are concerned about privacy and what data Google collects when people use the tool. Overall, most agree that Nano Banana Pro is a big step forward for image AI, but many want to watch how it is used in real life.

## CBP is monitoring US drivers and detaining those with suspicious travel patterns

- 原文链接: [CBP is monitoring US drivers and detaining those with suspicious travel patterns](https://apnews.com/article/immigration-border-patrol-surveillance-drivers-ice-trump-9f5d05469ce8c629d6fecf32d32098cd)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45996860)

This article talks about how US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is watching where people drive and stopping some drivers if their travel looks odd. The news comes from a new report that shows CBP is using cameras and license plate readers to track cars across the country.

The report explains that CBP is not just checking cars near the border. They are looking at travel patterns everywhere, even far from official border crossings. If someone’s driving looks “suspicious,” CBP might stop them or question them. The article says that the agency uses technology to collect lots of data about where cars go. This data is shared with other agencies, too.

The article gives examples, like people who drive to certain places often, or who take unusual routes, being stopped. Some drivers were searched or detained just because the computer system flagged their travel. The report raises privacy concerns because many people do not know they are being tracked. Some lawyers and civil rights groups worry this is unfair and may target innocent people.

CBP says they need to watch for threats and stop illegal activity. But the article says there is not much information about how someone gets marked as “suspicious.” Many lawmakers and privacy advocates are asking for more rules and oversight.

In the comment section, some people say they are worried about too much government surveillance. They think it is bad if the government tracks most people without a reason. Others say that safety is important, and it can help stop crime or illegal border crossings. A few users share personal stories of being stopped by CBP far from the border.

Some commenters think the rules are not clear and that “suspicious travel” is too vague. Others point out how technology can make mistakes and flag the wrong people. There is also discussion about privacy, with people saying it is hard to avoid being tracked now. A few users debate if this is really new, or if it is just easier now because of better technology. Some feel that more oversight is needed to protect people’s rights. Others argue that if you have nothing to hide, you shouldn’t worry. Many agree that the system could be abused if there are not strong rules.

## New Glenn Update – Blue Origin

- 原文链接: [New Glenn Update – Blue Origin](https://www.blueorigin.com/news/new-glenn-upgraded-engines-subcooled-components-drive-enhanced-performance)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45997914)

Blue Origin shared news about big upgrades coming to their New Glenn rocket, aiming to carry heavier loads and launch more often. The company is boosting engine power, improving rocket parts, and making the rocket easier to reuse.

The main change is stronger engines for both stages of the rocket. The seven BE-4 engines on the lower part of the rocket will now give 4.5 million pounds of thrust, up from 3.9 million. They reached 625,000 pounds of thrust in tests, with plans to hit 640,000 soon by using even colder fuel. The two BE-3U engines on the top part will also get stronger, moving from 320,000 to 400,000 pounds of thrust.

These upgrades mean customers will get better service, whether they need missions to low-Earth orbit, the Moon, or deeper into space. Other changes include a fairing (the rocket’s nose cone) that can be reused, tanks that cost less, and a new heat shield to speed up how fast the rocket can fly again.

Blue Origin is also building a new, larger rocket called New Glenn 9x4. This rocket will use more engines and carry more weight—over 70 metric tons to low-Earth orbit and more than 20 metric tons to the Moon. The new rocket will have a bigger fairing, too. Both the new and old rockets will fly at the same time to give customers more choices, including for big satellite groups, deep space trips, and national security launches.

In the comments, some people are excited to see Blue Origin finally making fast progress, especially after years of delays. Many are impressed with the engine improvements and like that Blue Origin is competing with SpaceX. Others are waiting to see real flights before getting too excited, saying that Blue Origin has promised a lot before but taken a long time to deliver.

A few commenters point out that reusing the fairing and making rockets fly again quicker is a big step, but they wonder if Blue Origin can really keep up with SpaceX’s pace. Some think the new, bigger rocket is a smart move for future needs, while others worry it might slow things down if Blue Origin tries to do too much at once.

Several people mention that having more choices for heavy launches is good for everyone, especially for government and science missions. There are also questions about how well the new engines will work in real launches, and if the company can make these upgrades without running into more delays.

Some users share hope that Blue Origin will help lower launch prices, while others remain doubtful until they see more rockets flying. In general, the comments show both excitement and caution: people want Blue Origin to succeed but know the rocket business is hard.

## Introducing Kagi Assistants

- 原文链接: [Introducing Kagi Assistants](https://blog.kagi.com/kagi-assistants)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45997294)

Kagi has launched two new AI tools: Quick Assistant and Research Assistant, designed to help people find information more easily. Quick Assistant gives fast, simple answers, while Research Assistant digs deeper for more detailed and varied results.

Both assistants use different AI models for different tasks and are built to make searching better for humans, not to replace them. Kagi says AI can sometimes give wrong answers, so their tools focus on showing sources and encouraging users to check the information themselves. You can use these assistants directly from Kagi’s website or by adding special keywords in the search bar, like “!quick” or “!research.”

Quick Assistant is made for speed and is available to everyone. Research Assistant is slower but provides more thorough answers and is available only to top-tier users. The Research Assistant uses several tools as it works, such as web search, code running, and even image generation or special APIs. Kagi benchmarks many AI models to pick the best one for each job and keeps their tests private to avoid bias.

The company explains that their assistants did very well in a public test called SimpleQA, scoring better than others at one point, but they are not chasing top scores anymore. They say focusing too much on benchmarks can make the tool less helpful in real life. Some benchmark answers are disputed or based on outdated data, and trying to always match them can lead to bad choices. Instead, Kagi wants to build tools that help people find real answers, not just win tests.

In the Hacker News comments, many people liked the idea of AI tools that help but do not replace human thinking. Some users praised Kagi for being honest about AI limits and not forcing AI features on everyone. Others questioned if the assistants are worth paying for, since similar tools exist and some are free.

A few users worried about privacy and where their search data goes when using these assistants. Some commenters were happy about the focus on citing sources, saying it helps them trust the answers more. Another group asked if Kagi’s assistants could handle non-English questions or technical research, and some shared positive experiences with Kagi’s clean search results.

There was also debate about how useful benchmarks like SimpleQA really are, with some saying they do not show real-world performance. One commenter liked Kagi’s flexible approach to using different models for different jobs. Others wondered if the assistants would stay helpful as the web changes. Some users hoped Kagi would keep improving without losing sight of what people actually need in a search tool.

## Run Docker containers natively in Proxmox 9.1 (OCI images)

- 原文链接: [Run Docker containers natively in Proxmox 9.1 (OCI images)](https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Finally_run_Docker_containers_natively_in_Proxmox_9.1.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45997722)

Proxmox VE 9.1 now lets users run Docker container images directly, without needing extra virtual machines or complicated setups. Before this, running Docker containers in Proxmox required workarounds or using a full VM, which could be slow and hard to manage.

The article explains that Proxmox VE is an open-source virtualization tool, similar to VMWare, and is popular for home labs and servers. Normally, it supports KVM virtual machines and LXC containers. However, LXC containers act more like small virtual machines, while Docker containers are usually for single applications. Until now, Proxmox users had to run Docker inside a VM, or sometimes inside LXC containers, but these setups often broke or were not recommended.

With Proxmox VE 9.1, you can now pull Docker (OCI) images and turn them into LXC containers. This is done by converting the Docker image into a format that LXC can use. The process is not perfect yet; it’s called a “tech preview,” so some features are missing. For example, you cannot simply update containers by pulling a new image, and the console may not always work. But you can start, stop, and enter containers much more easily, and it saves time for people running home labs.

To use this feature, you first update to Proxmox VE 9.1.1. Then, you pull the Docker image from an online registry, like docker.io, and create a new container from it. You can mount volumes, set environment variables, and manage the container like other LXC containers in Proxmox. The article gives a step-by-step example using the Mosquitto and Nginx Docker images, showing that they work fine.

From the comments, some users are excited about this new feature, saying it makes Proxmox easier and more powerful for running containers. They like that it removes the need for extra VMs and complicated setups. Others point out that this is still an early version, so it may not work for all use cases, especially if you need advanced Docker features like live migration or orchestration. Some are worried about the “conversion” process because it means you’re not running the container exactly as Docker intended, which could cause issues with updates or compatibility.

A few users wish Proxmox would support docker-compose files for managing groups of containers together. Some share tips about managing data and updating containers, noting that right now you have to delete and recreate containers for updates. There is also discussion about security, with some saying the new setup is safer than running Docker directly on the Proxmox host.

Others mention that, for bigger projects or production, you might still want to use Proxmox VMs or dedicated Docker hosts. Some people ask technical questions about how the conversion works, and a few share their own experiences or suggestions for improvement. Overall, the community seems interested and hopeful, but they know this feature is still new and not perfect yet.

## Data-at-Rest Encryption in DuckDB

- 原文链接: [Data-at-Rest Encryption in DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/2025/11/19/encryption-in-duckdb)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45996585)

DuckDB now lets you encrypt your databases “at rest,” meaning your data is safe even if someone gets a copy of your database file. The article explains how this new feature works, how to use it, and what it means for performance.

DuckDB uses standard encryption methods called AES-GCM-256 and AES-CTR-256. AES-GCM is safer because it also checks that data was not changed, but AES-CTR is faster. You choose which one you want. The encryption key is the secret piece you need to unlock the data; DuckDB helps you by turning any key you give it into a secure one. The main header of the database is always left unencrypted (it has no sensitive data), but everything else—including blocks, logs, and temporary files—is encrypted if you turn on encryption. Temporary files are also encrypted, so even if your computer crashes, leftover files on disk are not readable. 

To use encryption, you can make a new encrypted database or encrypt an old one by copying its data. You can also decrypt or re-encrypt by copying between databases. There are SQL commands to do this, and you can check which databases are encrypted with a built-in query. DuckDB does not need outside libraries for this, but if you use the “httpfs” extension (which uses OpenSSL), it will switch to a faster, safer encryption method. An older method (Mbed TLS) is now read-only because of a bug. 

The article also checks how fast encryption is. On a normal MacBook, running queries on encrypted data was almost as fast as with unencrypted data—especially when using OpenSSL. Even for bigger workloads, the slowdown was very small. The team says this means you can use encryption without worrying about much performance loss.

Now, let’s look at what people on Hacker News think. Some users are happy DuckDB now has built-in encryption, saying it’s important for sharing data or using DuckDB in the cloud. Others point out that while AES-GCM is strong, DuckDB’s encryption does not meet every official standard yet, so it may not be enough for very strict rules (like for banks). A few people compare DuckDB to other databases—PostgreSQL and SQLite—which have weaker or paid-only encryption, saying DuckDB’s move is a “win for open source.” 

Some comments warn that key management is still up to users—if you lose your key, your data is gone, and if you use a weak key, the encryption is pointless. One developer likes that temporary files and logs are encrypted, not just the main database, since these are often forgotten in other systems. Others ask about future plans for things like password-based key storage or cloud-integrated key management, hoping it will get even easier to use. 

A few users are curious about potential security holes, such as side-channel attacks or memory leaks, and want more information on how DuckDB handles those. Some praise the performance results, saying it’s great to see so little impact, while others remind everyone to check for updates, because encryption code can have hidden bugs. Finally, some wonder if using encrypted DuckDB files with many users will need new tools for sharing keys safely. Overall, most are positive and excited to try encrypted DuckDB in their own projects.

## NTSB Preliminary Report – UPS Boeing MD-11F Crash [pdf]

- 原文链接: [NTSB Preliminary Report – UPS Boeing MD-11F Crash [pdf]](https://www.ntsb.gov/Documents/Prelimiary%20Report%20DCA26MA024.pdf)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45995834)

The article is about a missing preliminary report from the NTSB on a UPS Boeing MD-11F plane crash. When users tried to access the report, they only saw a "Page not found" error instead of the report itself.

The page lists links to different parts of the NTSB website, like investigations, safety research, news, and more, but none leads to the missing report. The main message on the page says the file does not exist or the link is broken. It suggests users check for a typo in the URL or go back to the NTSB home page. There is no information about the crash, the investigation, or any findings. The rest of the page is made up of website navigation links and legal notices.

In the comments, some people are frustrated that the report is missing, saying this happens too often with official documents. Others wonder if the report was removed on purpose or if it is just a mistake. A few users point out that big sites often break links when they update their pages or file systems. One person suggests using the Internet Archive to find old versions of the missing report. Another commenter notes that the NTSB usually posts accident reports quickly, so this might be a technical issue. Some users share tips for finding official accident reports, like checking the docket search or contacting the NTSB directly. Others discuss the importance of public access to safety reports for learning and preventing future accidents. A few users joke about how "Page not found" errors are common even on important government sites. Someone mentions that the MD-11 is a tricky plane to fly, so they are extra curious about what happened. Finally, one person asks if anyone has a backup copy of the report they can share.

## Mozilla Says It's Finally Done with Two-Faced Onerep

- 原文链接: [Mozilla Says It's Finally Done with Two-Faced Onerep](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/11/mozilla-says-its-finally-done-with-two-faced-onerep/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45996433)

Mozilla is ending its partnership with Onerep, a company that claims to remove your personal data from people-search websites. The decision comes after it was found that Onerep’s founder, Dimitiri Shelest, also owns and runs similar people-search and data broker sites, which many saw as a conflict of interest.

Mozilla had offered a paid service called Monitor Plus, powered by Onerep, inside its Firefox browser. This service helped users find and remove their data from sites that collect and sell personal information. In early 2024, a report showed Shelest had a long history of launching people-search companies, including one called Nuwber, which still sells background reports. After this report, Mozilla said it would stop working with Onerep, but the partnership continued for more than a year. Now, Mozilla says Monitor Plus will fully shut down in December 2025, and any unused subscription money will be refunded.

Mozilla explained that it tried to keep Monitor Plus running, but it couldn’t find a vendor that matched its high standards for privacy and reliability. The company also said it will focus on its free data breach alert service, and work to add more privacy features to Firefox, like their VPN.

The main problem was that Onerep’s owner was running both privacy protection and data collection businesses at the same time. This made people question if Onerep could really protect users’ data. Shelest later admitted he still owned Nuwber, even while running Onerep.

Looking at the top comments, many users were surprised that it took Mozilla so long to end this partnership. Some questioned if Mozilla kept working with Onerep because the deal was profitable. Others said this situation shows how hard it is to trust privacy tools, especially when the people behind them might have hidden interests. A few commenters wondered why Mozilla didn’t spot these problems earlier, given their focus on privacy. Some users defended Mozilla, saying it’s tough to find good partners in the messy world of data brokers. Others felt Mozilla should build these privacy tools themselves, to avoid such conflicts in the future. In general, most agreed that trust is key for privacy services, and that this story is a lesson for companies to be more careful about who they work with.

## GitHut – Programming Languages and GitHub

- 原文链接: [GitHut – Programming Languages and GitHub](https://githut.info/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45998047)

GitHut is a website that shows which programming languages are most active on GitHub using data and charts. It uses public data from GitHub and GitHub Archive to count how much different languages are used in open-source code.

The main page lists the top programming languages by activity, with JavaScript, Java, Python, and CSS at the top. It shows this information over different quarters, so you can see how things change over time. The site explains that it uses the number of code changes (pushes) as the main way to measure activity, because not all new projects list their language. This means some languages could be under-counted, especially for new projects. GitHut collects and updates its data every few months. There are also links to the data sources and the project’s code on GitHub. The project’s creator says programming languages are not just tools but ways to share ideas and solve problems. The site uses a timeline to show when each language started, and you can compare their popularity over time. The data is open, and anyone can check the project’s code or use the same data.

In the Hacker News comments, some people liked how easy it is to see language trends over time. Others said that the way GitHub counts languages can be misleading, especially for projects with many files or for projects that mix languages. A few users pointed out that older languages like C or C++ may be undercounted because big, important projects don’t always update often. Some people said that JavaScript’s high rank is because many web projects use it by default. Others questioned if GitHub is the best place to measure all programming, since not every developer uses GitHub, and private code isn’t counted. A few users liked seeing newer languages like Go and Rust in the list. Some developers wanted more details about how the activity is measured and what counts as a “change.” There was also talk about how the data could be improved by looking at stars, forks, or issues, not just code pushes. Overall, most people found GitHut useful, but they also saw its limits and suggested ways to make it better.

## The Lions Operating System

- 原文链接: [The Lions Operating System](https://lionsos.org)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45995816)

LionsOS is a new operating system built on the seL4 microkernel, and it aims to bring seL4’s high security, speed, and reliability to more people. The system is still in early development and isn’t considered stable, but it’s open for anyone who wants to try it out or help build it.

LionsOS is not like most operating systems. Instead of giving you a big, ready-made system, it gives you small parts called components. You can pick the parts you need and put them together to make a system that fits your own project or device. These components are put together using a tool called Microkit. Each component is designed to do just one job—for example, a driver only talks between hardware and the rest of the system. Components talk to each other using fast, lock-free queues, which helps keep things running quickly and safely. There’s also something called a virtualiser, which helps control and manage how drivers talk to hardware and handle addresses. Information is only shared when really needed, and always in controlled ways. The system is designed to be static, so it doesn’t change itself while running or add new parts on the fly. However, you can swap out some parts of the same type if you need to—for example, if you want to update a kernel in a virtual machine.

The article also says that LionsOS needs more components to be truly useful for many people. The team welcomes help from outside developers, and there’s a guide for people who want to contribute.

In the comments, some people are excited about the focus on security and reliability, saying seL4 is known for strong guarantees. Others like the idea of building custom systems from small, single-purpose pieces. Some users are concerned that requiring a static system could make it less flexible, and wonder how it will handle changing hardware or updates in the real world. There are also questions about the learning curve—since it’s very different from Linux or Windows, it might be hard for new users or developers to get started. A few people mention that having a strong community and good documentation will be important for its success. Others share worries about needing more drivers and hardware support before it can be widely used. Some are hopeful that, with more contributors, LionsOS could become a good choice for secure devices and special projects. One user notes that this approach might work very well for embedded systems where stability and security matter most. Overall, the comments show both excitement and caution about how LionsOS will grow and who will use it.
