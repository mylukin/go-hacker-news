LIGO and its partners have found the biggest black hole merger ever seen, making a new record in space science. Two huge black holes, one about 100 times the mass of our Sun and the other about 140 times, crashed together and formed a new black hole that is 225 times the mass of the Sun.

This event, called GW231123, was found in November 2023 during LIGO's fourth big observing period. LIGO first made history in 2015 when it found the first gravitational waves, which come from black holes merging far away. Now, with help from Virgo in Italy and KAGRA in Japan, the team has seen over 300 black hole mergers in total.

Before this, the largest known black hole merger was in 2021, making a black hole 140 times the Sun’s mass. The new event is much bigger and the black holes were also spinning very fast, which makes it hard to study their signals. Scientists say that black holes this big should not form in the usual way, so maybe these black holes were made from even smaller mergers in the past.

Researchers are excited because this finding tests the limits of their tools and theories. The black holes’ rapid spinning nearly breaks the rules set by Einstein’s theory. It took special models to read the signal, and scientists think it will take years to fully understand what happened. The event shows that there is still much to learn about black holes and the strange things they do.

The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA team is made up of thousands of scientists from around the world. They use very sensitive machines to feel tiny changes in space caused by these huge events. More data about this event will be shared soon, and other scientists will get to look at it too.

In the comment section, many people are amazed at how big these black holes are and how strong the technology must be to detect their signals. Some are surprised that such massive black holes can exist, since old theories say stars cannot make black holes this big. Others talk about how black holes might grow by eating other black holes, leading to these giant mergers.

Some commenters are curious about how accurate the measurements are and if we might find even bigger black holes soon. A few people discuss the teamwork between different countries and how open science is helping everyone learn faster. There are also questions about what this means for our understanding of space and if new physics could be waiting in these strange signals.

People also wonder about the future of gravitational wave astronomy and what new things we might discover as the tools get better. Some share excitement about the chance to see more complex black hole events, and a few joke about how black holes are like “cosmic Pac-Men,” always eating more and getting bigger. Overall, the community is both amazed and full of questions, showing that this discovery has made people think deeply about the universe.

## Apple's MLX adding CUDA support

- 原文链接: [Apple's MLX adding CUDA support](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx/pull/1983)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44565668)

Apple’s MLX library is adding support for CUDA, which means it can soon run on NVIDIA GPUs, not just on Apple hardware. This work is early but already runs some examples, and it is being sponsored by Apple.

The main reason for CUDA support is because NVIDIA GPUs are common in research and big computing jobs. CUDA also supports unified memory, making it easier to move code from a Mac to big servers. The developer, zcbenz, explains how to build and run the new CUDA backend. Early tests work on Ubuntu with CUDA 11.6, but other systems might work too. The code is still changing a lot, and more updates are coming soon.

Technical details show that the team is focusing on performance. They found some slow parts in the code, like waiting for events and unnecessary memory moves. By fixing these, training speed jumped from 500 steps per second up to 2100. Some optimizations, like keeping temporary data longer, made things faster but could use more memory. The developer plans to make this tradeoff easy to adjust.

There are also notes on building for special devices like NVIDIA Jetson. Right now, these builds have problems, but the team wants to fix them later. There are also tips for speeding up the build process, and plans for just-in-time (JIT) compiling in the future.

In the comments, people are excited and thank the developer for making MLX more useful. Some want to add support for AMD GPUs (ROCm) and discuss how to do this, like sharing code or converting CUDA code to work with AMD. Others talk about the best way to merge the new code—should it go in all at once, or in small steps? Most agree that small, regular updates are easier to manage.

Some users test the new code on their hardware and give feedback on errors and fixes. There’s also a discussion about memory use: holding data longer makes things faster, but could be a problem for big models. The developer agrees, saying it should be easy to change this setting later.

Overall, the community is happy with the progress and shares advice on both technical fixes and project management. Many people react with “hearts” and “rockets,” showing strong support and excitement for CUDA support in MLX.

## RFC: PHP license update

- 原文链接: [RFC: PHP license update](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/php_license_update)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44565647)

PHP wants to change its software license to make things simpler and clearer for everyone. Right now, PHP uses a custom license, and the Zend Engine (part of PHP) has its own license too, which are both confusing and not always compatible with other open source licenses. The new plan is to use the well-known Modified BSD License (also called the 3-clause BSD license) for both PHP and the Zend Engine, starting with PHP version 9.0.

The BSD license is already popular in the open source world and is approved by important groups like the OSI (Open Source Initiative) and FSF (Free Software Foundation). It is also compatible with the GPL, which is another common license. The new license will not take away any rights from users or contributors, and it won’t add new restrictions. Instead, it will remove special rules that only mattered for the PHP Group and Zend/Perforce, making the license the same as the standard BSD license for everyone.

The RFC explains that this change will help prevent problems that happened in the past, such as confusion over who can use the PHP name, and trouble for package maintainers (like Debian) who needed a clearer license for distributing PHP and extensions. The BSD license is easier to understand, applies to many projects, and avoids legal arguments about naming and advertising clauses, which caused problems before.

The document gives a brief history of PHP’s licenses. At first, PHP used the GPL, then moved to an Apache-style license, and later made its own. Over time, more conditions were added to protect the PHP and Zend names, but this made it harder for others to use or distribute PHP. Some changes were made after feedback from companies and open source groups, but the result was still complicated and sometimes not fully approved by groups like the OSI or Debian.

This RFC also says that each contributor to PHP owns their code, but by contributing, they agreed to use the same license as the project. The new license does not change the rights for most contributors, but PHP Group and Perforce must agree since they have special rights under the old license. Both groups have already given informal approval, and the plan is to have a public discussion for at least six months before voting.

If this proposal is accepted, all PHP code will switch to the BSD license, and the old licenses will be deprecated. This should reduce confusion, make PHP easier to use and distribute, and make legal questions easier to answer.

In the Hacker News comments, many users welcomed the change, saying it is long overdue. Some explained how the old PHP license created problems for Linux distributions like Debian, which sometimes had to rename PHP packages or avoid certain extensions because of license confusion. Others pointed out that the BSD license is clear, short, and better understood by most companies and lawyers, which should help PHP adoption and use in more places.

A few people worried about possible downsides, like losing trademark protection for the PHP name. Others asked if all contributors really agree with the change, but most agreed that since the new license gives the same rights, this is not a problem. Some users also discussed the history of other open source projects moving to simpler licenses, and said this is a good sign for the PHP community.

One person mentioned that this could make it easier to write PHP extensions or embed PHP in other software without worrying about legal trouble. Another commenter said that even though the change seems small, it will help many developers and companies who were stuck on license questions before.

Overall, the community seems happy with the idea, and hopes other projects with strange or confusing licenses will follow PHP’s lead and pick well-known, simple licenses in the future.

## DEWLine Museum – The Distant Early Warning Radar Line

- 原文链接: [DEWLine Museum – The Distant Early Warning Radar Line](https://dewlinemuseum.com/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44566034)

The article talks about the Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line, a radar system built during the Cold War to spot enemy planes coming over the Arctic from the USSR. It shares details from the DEWLine Museum website, which tries to keep the history alive for people who were never there or want to learn more.

The DEW Line was made very fast—just 32 months—even though the work was very hard and the Arctic weather was harsh. The line had 33 stations across 3,600 miles of cold, empty land, from Alaska to Greenland. These radar sites watched for threats 24 hours a day, every day, for 36 years. There were three types of stations at first: Main, Auxiliary, and Intermediate, but the Intermediate sites were closed after a few years because they didn’t work well. Main sites were big and held up to 70 people, while Auxiliary sites were smaller.

Building and running these sites was hard because of the cold, the distance, and the need to keep everything working all the time. After the DEW Line was closed, it left behind a lot of waste—fuel drums, broken machines, and even dangerous chemicals, which raised big questions about cleanup. The website also mentions how Inuit people were part of the story, both helping with construction and being affected by the project.

The museum is “virtual” because there aren’t many artifacts left, but the team is trying to build a small physical space in another Cold War museum. The website has photos, videos, and stories from people who worked on the DEW Line, plus a library of old documents.

In the comments, many people are surprised at how huge the project was and how quickly it was built. Some say it’s amazing how people worked in such tough places, keeping the stations running all year. Others talk about the bad effects—like the waste left behind and how it changed life for the Inuit. A few remember seeing these radar domes as kids or even had family members who worked there. Some wish more was being done to save the history, while others are glad there’s at least a virtual museum. There are also questions about how the technology worked and what replaced the DEW Line after the Cold War. A few worry about the environmental damage and hope the cleanup is better today. Overall, people are both impressed by the effort and mindful of its cost to people and nature.

## Kiro: A new agentic IDE

- 原文链接: [Kiro: A new agentic IDE](https://kiro.dev/blog/introducing-kiro/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44560662)

Kiro is a new AI-powered IDE that helps developers go from idea to finished product by making specs and automation part of coding. The article explains how most AI tools can quickly make prototypes, but turning those into real, production-ready apps is harder—requirements can be unclear, and documentation is often missing.

Kiro solves this by using “specs”—written plans that spell out what a feature should do. You can prompt Kiro with a simple idea, like “add a review system,” and it breaks this down into user stories and checks for every edge case. It uses EARS notation to make requirements clear, so you know exactly what the system will build.

Next, Kiro creates technical designs from these requirements. It looks at your code, then makes diagrams, TypeScript interfaces, database tables, and API endpoints—all the details needed before coding starts. This helps avoid confusion and wasted time.

After design, Kiro turns everything into tasks and sub-tasks, putting them in the right order, linking each back to the original requirements, and adding things like tests and checks for mobile and accessibility. You can see progress and review code changes as you go.

Kiro also uses “hooks”—small automations that run when you save or change files. For example, it can update tests when you save a React component, or check for security issues before you commit code. This keeps your whole team following the same code standards and helps catch mistakes early.

Besides specs and hooks, Kiro supports AI chat, lets you use your VS Code settings and plugins, and works on all major platforms and languages. The goal is to make building software smoother, with better planning, less tech debt, and easier teamwork.

In the Hacker News comments, some users are excited about Kiro’s focus on specs and automation, saying it might help stop common problems like unclear requirements and poor documentation. Others wonder if developers will really keep specs up-to-date, or if this will turn into just another tool people stop using. Some think hooks could be very helpful for teams, while others are worried about too much automation breaking their workflow.

A few people ask if Kiro can really understand complex, real-world projects, or if it works best for smaller apps. There are also questions about how well Kiro handles changes over time—will specs and code stay in sync? Some worry about lock-in or losing control over their own process. Others like that Kiro builds on VS Code, so they don’t have to start over.

Many agree that tools like Kiro are moving the industry forward, but some want to see real examples before deciding. There is interest in how Kiro might help junior developers learn better habits, while experienced programmers hope it doesn’t get in the way of deeper thinking. Overall, the community is curious, but waiting to see how well Kiro works in practice.

## NeuralOS: An operating system powered by neural networks

- 原文链接: [NeuralOS: An operating system powered by neural networks](https://neural-os.com/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44564531)

NeuralOS is a new project that shows how an operating system can be simulated using neural networks. Instead of regular code, this OS uses AI models—like RNNs and diffusion models—to create and control the environment you see on screen.

In the demo, users can interact with NeuralOS by moving their mouse, clicking, or typing on the keyboard. The blue box on the website is the main area where you can try these actions. You can change "sampling steps" to balance speed and quality: more steps mean better quality but slower response. There are options to use either RNNs (recurrent neural networks) or a different AI model called a diffusion model. You can also turn on "Auto Input," which makes the system create new frames by itself if you are not active for a bit.

The main idea is to see if neural networks can not only generate images or text, but actually run something like an operating system—handling input, updating the screen, and responding to users. This is different from traditional OS design, which relies on direct programming and clear rules. NeuralOS tries to "learn" how to behave like an OS from data, instead of being programmed step by step.

The project is open source, so anyone can look at the code and try it out. The demo gives a hands-on way to play with the idea, but it is not meant to replace real operating systems yet. It is more of an experiment to see what neural networks can do.

In the Hacker News comments, some people are amazed that a neural network can simulate an OS at all. They like how creative this project is, and think it's a cool way to push AI research forward. Others feel it is more of an art project or tech demo, not something useful for real work. They point out that current neural networks are slow and can't handle the complexity of modern operating systems. Some worry about reliability, since neural networks can make strange mistakes that normal code would not.

A few commenters ask about the technical details: how the neural network is trained, what data it uses, and how fast it runs in practice. Some are curious if this approach could ever be practical, or if it's just a fun experiment. Others wonder if neural networks could help with parts of OS design, like user interfaces, rather than replacing the whole system.

There's also some debate about the future: some think neural-powered systems could become more common, while others doubt they will ever be as reliable or efficient as traditional operating systems. A few people suggest combining neural networks with regular code to get the best of both worlds. Overall, the comments mix excitement, doubt, and curiosity about where this kind of research could lead.

Blender Studio has released a new free game called DOGWALK, where you play as a big dog helping a child build a snowman in winter woods. The game is a short, open-world story with cute art, made using real paper models scanned into the computer.

You can explore areas like camps, forests, creeks, and a frozen pond. The game lets you choose how you want to act—be helpful or just have fun. There are no ways to lose, only different moments based on what you do. The art and animations are based on real handmade models, giving the game a special look. The project is open-source: the code is under the GPL license, and the art is Creative Commons. Blender Studio made the game to test and improve Blender and the Godot game engine. You can download the game for Windows, macOS, and Linux, and all files and documentation are on their website. Most people finish the game in about 30 minutes, and it has a high rating from players.

Many comments praise the cute art, fun gameplay, and sweet story. One person loved the way the dog lies down and gets petted by the child. Some asked for a browser version to play without downloading. There was a debate about the open-source license: one user worried the source code was not included with the download, which is important for GPL projects. Others explained that the rules only require the source to be available, not bundled. Blender Studio staff replied, saying they will make the license clearer and add more links to the real source files. Players also enjoyed the relaxing style and creative use of paper models. Some called it a great example of free and open software for games. Overall, people liked how open, cute, and creative the project is.

## Context Rot: How increasing input tokens impacts LLM performance

- 原文链接: [Context Rot: How increasing input tokens impacts LLM performance](https://research.trychroma.com/context-rot)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44564248)

This article looks at how large language models (LLMs) like GPT, Claude, Gemini, and Qwen handle longer input texts, also called long context windows. The main focus is to see if these models really work well when given a lot of information at once, not just on simple tests but in more real and complex tasks.

At first, the article explains that many LLMs now support millions of input tokens, and they often get perfect scores on simple “Needle in a Haystack” tests. In these tests, a model just needs to find a known sentence hidden in a big pile of unrelated text. But the authors say this kind of test is too simple—it just checks if the model can match words, not if it can understand or reason about the content.

To dig deeper, the authors run experiments with 18 different LLMs. They change things like:
- How similar the question is to the hidden answer (needle)
- How many “distractor” sentences are in the text (sentences that look similar to the answer but aren’t correct)
- How much the hidden answer blends in with the rest of the text
- Whether the text is kept in order or shuffled randomly

They also use more complex tests, like conversational question-answering (LongMemEval) and a task where the model just has to repeat a long sequence of words exactly.

The main findings are:
- When the input gets longer, model performance drops, even if the task stays simple.
- If the question and answer are less similar, performance drops even faster with longer texts.
- Adding distractors (similar but wrong answers) makes it harder for models to find the right answer, and some distractors are more confusing than others.
- If the hidden answer blends in with the rest of the text, results are mixed—sometimes it’s harder, sometimes not, depending on the model and the topic.
- Surprisingly, when the main text is well-structured and logical, models do worse than when the text is just random sentences mixed together.
- In the repeated words test, models struggle to copy long sequences exactly, especially as the text gets longer. Sometimes they refuse to answer or make small mistakes.

Looking at the top comments from Hacker News, people have different ideas about these findings:
- Some users say this shows that benchmarks don’t match real-world tasks. They agree we need better tests to see how LLMs really work in practice.
- Others point out that these problems are not new—humans also struggle with lots of information or distractions, so some performance drop is normal.
- A few commenters focus on the surprising result that models do worse with well-ordered text. Some guess this happens because models lose focus trying to follow logical flow, or maybe the attention mechanism in LLMs works differently than we expect.
- There are comments about how important “context engineering” will be. That means carefully deciding what information to put in the prompt, and how to organize it, to get the best results from a model.
- Some users wonder if bigger or newer models will eventually solve these problems, or if this is a limit of the current LLM design.
- Others share frustration with how LLMs sometimes refuse to answer or make random errors, especially on very long or strange prompts.
- A few people ask about practical advice: how to break up long documents, use retrieval tools, or design systems that help LLMs focus only on what matters.
- Some users are hopeful that the research will push for better tools and more honest benchmarks, while others worry that hype about big context windows is ahead of what the tech can really do.

Overall, the discussion shows that while LLMs are getting better at handling more text, there are still many open questions about how they work with long and complex inputs, and how developers should use them in real projects.

## Show HN: Bedrock – An 8-bit computing system for running programs anywhere

- 原文链接: [Show HN: Bedrock – An 8-bit computing system for running programs anywhere](https://benbridle.com/projects/bedrock.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44526322)

Bedrock is a tiny 8-bit computer system that you can use to write programs that work on almost any device. The main idea is to keep things simple, easy to learn, and make sure programs will still run years from now.

Bedrock is not a physical computer; it is a set of rules (a “specification”) for how a simple computer should work. Any device or computer can run Bedrock programs if someone makes a Bedrock emulator for it. There are only 32 instructions and 12 devices to remember, so the system is quick to learn. Right now, you can run Bedrock programs on Windows, Linux, the web, and even the Nintendo DS. The emulator is easy to create and can be made in just a few hours. You write your code using an assembler, which turns your instructions into a format the emulator can run.

The website has live demos, including a pixel art drawing program, a Snake game, a clock like those on old microwaves, a system info display, and an on-screen keyboard for the Nintendo DS. There are guides for getting started, including how to print a string and how to build and run your own programs. Bedrock started as a fork of another simple computer system called Uxn, but it changed a lot to be even simpler and work better on weak devices. The focus is on making programs that are easy to move and hard to break.

In the comments, people liked how simple and small Bedrock is, saying it’s a good way to make sure programs are still working in the future. Some said it’s great for learning how computers work, and it could even help teach kids or beginners. A few users compared it to other systems like Uxn and CHIP-8, noting how each has different strengths. Others wondered if it could be used for real work, or just fun demos, and some hoped more people would write tools or games for it. There were questions about performance and if the system could be smaller or faster. Some were excited about the idea of running the same program everywhere, even on very old or strange devices. A few asked about security and if Bedrock could be used for trusted systems. In general, people found Bedrock interesting and liked the focus on lasting, easy-to-understand programs.

## Replicube: 3D shader puzzle game, online demo

- 原文链接: [Replicube: 3D shader puzzle game, online demo](https://replicube.xyz/staging/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44535202)

Replicube is a 3D puzzle game that you can play in your browser. The game uses shaders for its graphics and has an online demo people can try. In Replicube, you move cubes around a 3D space to solve puzzles. The main challenge is to copy or “replicate” a target shape by pushing and arranging the cubes just right. The controls are simple: you use your mouse or keyboard to rotate the view and move the cubes. The graphics are smooth and have a clean, modern look thanks to WebGL and custom shaders. There’s no need to install anything; it runs directly in most modern browsers. The puzzles start easy, but they quickly get harder as you progress. Some levels need careful planning because moving one cube can block another. The game has a minimal design, with no extra menus or distractions. You get instant feedback when you solve a level, making it feel rewarding. The demo is free, so anyone can give it a try. It’s a good example of how web technology can create fun, interactive 3D experiences.

People in the comments liked how smooth and fast the game runs in the browser. Some were impressed by the clever use of shaders to make the graphics look so good. A few users said they enjoyed the puzzle design and found the game addictive. Others pointed out that the controls could be confusing at first, but they got easier with practice. One commenter wished there were more instructions or a tutorial for beginners. Some developers asked about the technology stack and wanted to know how the shaders were written. There were discussions about browser compatibility—most people had no problems, but a few had issues on older devices or browsers that don’t support WebGL well. Someone suggested adding sound or music to make the game more engaging. Another person said it would be fun to play on a phone or tablet, but the controls might need changes for touchscreens. Overall, the feedback was positive, with many hoping to see more levels or features in the future.
