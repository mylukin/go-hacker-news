SpaceX is planning to launch the tenth test flight of its huge Starship rocket, aiming to keep improving after the last flight ended with Starship loss. This test will focus on making Starship and its Super Heavy booster more reliable, with new hardware and operation changes based on past problems.

The main goals include new landing burn tests for the booster, trying out different engine setups, and practicing payload deployment for the first time. The Super Heavy booster will fly out over the Gulf of America and do experiments—like flipping in the air and testing backup engines during landing burns. After the booster separates, it will try to land with only two engines, dropping into the ocean at the end.

Starship, the upper part, will test deploying eight fake Starlink satellites, try to restart one of its Raptor engines in space, and do experiments to help it return safely to the launch site in future flights. Engineers removed some heat tiles to see how Starship handles reentry in weaker spots, and added new types of metallic tiles, including some with active cooling. There are also new catch fittings and a smoother edge on the heat shield to fix past hot spots.

The timeline of the flight shows each step, from filling the tanks to the rocket’s landing attempt, with key moments like “Max Q” (the time of highest air pressure), booster separation, and the exciting landing at the end. The whole test provides data to improve future Starships, with a goal of building a rocket that can fly again and again.

In the Hacker News comments, some readers are amazed at how fast SpaceX is moving, saying it’s impressive to see so many test flights in just a few years. Others worry about safety, asking if it’s wise to remove heat tiles and push the limits so much. Some think the booster landing tests are bold, especially using only two engines. A few commenters discuss the technical details, like the choice to do a “hot stage” separation and how it saves fuel. People also mention how SpaceX shares so much information, which is unusual for rocket companies.

A couple of readers are skeptical about whether Starship will ever become fully reusable as planned. Others are excited that SpaceX is trying new things, like deploying Starlink simulators, and say these risky tests are how real progress happens. Some wish NASA and other agencies would move as quickly. There are comments about the environmental impact of so many launches and dropping boosters into the ocean, while others point out that collecting real-world data is the best way to improve. A few are just excited to watch the live stream and see what happens next.

## The two versions of Parquet

- 原文链接: [The two versions of Parquet](https://www.jeronimo.dev/the-two-versions-of-parquet/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44970769)

This article talks about two versions of the Parquet file format and why the newer version is not used much yet. Parquet is a popular format for storing big data, but not all tools and engines support its latest features.

The author first explains that some tools, like DuckDB and others, do not fully support Parquet Version 2. This stops other people from using the new version, because files written with it cannot be read everywhere. The author built a tool called Carpet, which used Version 2 by default. But then, he found out that older versions of Python’s Pandas could not open these files, so he had to change it back to Version 1.

The article says that the Parquet Version 2 specification is finished, but many tools do not agree on what features are required to support it. There are long, ongoing discussions among developers about what makes a file “Version 2.” The main changes in Version 2 include new ways to store and compress data, and a new way to organize parts of the file called Data Page V2. Some people think adding new compression methods is more important, while others care about how data is stored in the file.

The article also explains that logical types, like dates or strings, are not tied to any Parquet version. These logical types sit on top of basic data types and are still changing. In the world of machine learning, Parquet and ORC are starting to feel limited when people need to work with files with thousands of columns. This has led to new formats like Nimble and LV2, but the author thinks Parquet will still be the main choice for most data engineers.

The author tests how much better Version 2 works. He shows that Version 2 can make files smaller and faster to write and read, especially when the data is not compressed. The improvements in file size and speed are bigger with numeric data, like in the New York taxi dataset. However, for some compression methods, the difference is small or even negative.

When it comes to writing and reading speed, Version 2 is usually faster, with bigger gains in datasets with lots of numbers. For example, writing and reading GZIP-compressed files is much quicker with Version 2. Still, the change is not huge for every case.

At the end, the author says that while Version 2 is better, the improvements are not enough to make everyone switch, especially because many tools cannot read Version 2 files. If you control the whole system, you might want to use Version 2, but for most people, it is safer to stay with Version 1 for now.

In the comments, some people agree that Parquet’s slow progress is a problem for teams who want new features. Others say backward compatibility is important, and rushing to use Version 2 could break things for users who rely on older software. A few mention that open standards often move slowly because many groups must agree. Some developers say they prefer to wait until Version 2 is supported everywhere before using it.

Several readers share stories about trying Version 2 and having problems with other tools not reading their files. Some think that the community should push harder for progress, while others defend the careful approach. There are comments about how hard it is to balance new features with the need to keep things working for everyone. One person points out that even with new formats like Nimble and LV2, most people will stick with Parquet because it is so well known. Overall, the discussion shows that while people are excited about improvements, most want to avoid breaking their data workflows.

## Show HN: My first game made with my homemade engine

- 原文链接: [Show HN: My first game made with my homemade engine](https://reprobate.site/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44990089)

Someone on Hacker News shared their first game, called "Reprobate," which they made using a game engine they built themselves. The post includes a link to the game’s website and says this is their first project with their homemade engine.

The article itself is short and does not give many details, but from the context, we know this is about making and sharing a video game and also building the tools (the engine) from scratch. The creator spent time not just designing the game, but also writing the code that runs it. Making your own game engine is a big task. It means you do not use popular engines like Unity or Unreal, but instead write your own code for graphics, sound, and game logic. This is hard, but it gives you full control and helps you learn a lot about how games work inside.

People who make their own engines often do it to learn, or because they want something special that other engines do not offer. Sometimes, homemade engines are simpler and smaller, which is good for small games, learning, or running on old computers. The game "Reprobate" shows what the creator learned and built. Sharing the game on Hacker News helps them get feedback and maybe find bugs or ideas to make it better.

In the comments, many people say “congratulations” and praise the creator for finishing both a game and a game engine. They know it takes a lot of work and patience. Some ask how the engine works, what programming language was used, or if the creator plans to share the engine code with others. A few commenters suggest adding more features, like more levels or different art styles. Others share their own stories about making games or engines and talk about the fun and challenges. Some people ask why make a new engine when there are so many good ones already. Fans of homemade engines explain it is good for learning and can be fun. One person points out that making a game and engine by yourself helps you understand computers better. Another reminds that, while it is hard, it is also very satisfying to see your own engine run a real game. Overall, the comments are positive, supportive, and full of advice and encouragement for the creator’s next steps.

## Everything I know about good API design

- 原文链接: [Everything I know about good API design](https://www.seangoedecke.com/good-api-design/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45006801)

This article explains how to design good APIs for software, using many real examples and personal stories. The main idea is that APIs should be simple, familiar, and almost “boring,” so using them feels easy and natural for other developers.

The author says API design is about balancing two things: being familiar for users, and flexible for future changes. APIs are hard to change after release because any breaking change can hurt people’s software. So, it’s very important to avoid breaking existing users’ code—this is called “not breaking userspace.” If you must make a big change, you should use versioning (like /v1/ and /v2/ in the URL), but this makes your work harder and can be confusing for users. Only use versioning when there is no better way.

The article also points out that the real value of an API depends on the product it connects to. If your product is very useful, even a bad API will be used. But if your product is badly designed, it’s almost impossible to make a nice API for it. The article gives examples of how awkward product models lead to awkward APIs.

For authentication, the author recommends using simple, long-lived API keys, because many users are not expert engineers. More complex options like OAuth can be useful, but should not be the only way.

The article talks about idempotency, which means making sure repeating an action (like creating a comment) does not cause problems. This is important when handling failures, like timeouts or server errors. You can solve this with idempotency keys.

APIs should have rate limits to prevent users from overloading the system. You should also add helpful headers in responses to tell users about their limits. For returning large lists, cursor-based pagination is better than simple page/offset methods, because it scales better with large data.

If some fields in a response are expensive to compute, make those fields optional. The author is not a big fan of GraphQL because he finds it complex, but admits it can help in special cases. Internal APIs (used only inside a company) have different rules, as you can coordinate changes more easily.

In the comments, many readers agree that not breaking userspace is very important. Some share stories of API changes that broke their systems and caused big problems. Others point out that real-world needs, like security or business rules, sometimes force breaking changes or complex authentication, especially for sensitive data.

Several commenters like cursor-based pagination, but note that it can be tricky for users to understand at first. Some think GraphQL is powerful when many clients need different data, but agree it’s harder to learn and debug. There’s debate about how much documentation matters—some people want lots of examples, while others are happy with simple Markdown docs.

A few readers say versioning is sometimes overused, and more care in design can avoid the need for new versions. Others argue that supporting old versions for too long can slow down progress and increase costs. People also discuss how APIs often reflect the underlying system; if the system is messy, the API will be too.

Many say that API design is really about empathy—thinking of the other developers who will use your API, and making their work easier. Some note that non-engineers often use APIs, so clear docs and simple keys are very helpful. There is also discussion about tools like OpenAPI or JSON versus XML, but most agree that picking familiar, simple formats is best.

## A brilliant and nearby one-off fast radio burst localized to 13pc precision

- 原文链接: [A brilliant and nearby one-off fast radio burst localized to 13pc precision](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/adf62f)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45006902)

A team of scientists found a very bright and unusual fast radio burst (FRB) coming from space, and they were able to pinpoint its location with great accuracy—within 13 parsecs. The article explains what makes this FRB special and how rare such events are. 

Fast radio bursts are short, intense flashes of radio waves from far away in the universe. Most FRBs last less than a second and are hard to study because they happen quickly and are very far away. This particular FRB was much brighter than usual and close enough that scientists could study it in more detail. The team used several big radio telescopes to find exactly where the signal came from. They used a technique called interferometry, which lets them combine data from many antennas to get a very sharp view. By doing this, they could say exactly which galaxy—and even which part of the galaxy—the burst came from.

The article talks about how important it is to know the exact spot where an FRB comes from. That helps scientists figure out what might be making these bursts. Some ideas are neutron stars, magnetars, or other strange objects. Because this FRB was so bright and rare, it gives scientists a special chance to learn more about these sources. The article also mentions that this discovery could help us understand more about matter in space between galaxies, since FRBs pass through all that material on their way to us.

In the comment section, some readers are very excited about how precise the location is. They say this kind of data can help solve the mystery of where FRBs come from. Others point out that even though we know the location, we still don’t know what causes these bursts, and there is much more to learn. Some users discuss the different tools and methods used, like interferometry, and praise how technology is helping us see more details. A few people wonder if such bright FRBs might be signs of alien technology, while others think this is unlikely and prefer natural explanations. There are questions about what makes this FRB so much brighter than others. Some readers hope this discovery will inspire more searches for bright or nearby FRBs. Others say it’s amazing how much we can learn about faraway space using just radio waves and careful measurements. A couple of users remind everyone that science is slow, and each new discovery is just one step toward understanding the universe.

## Making games in Go: 3 months without LLMs vs. 3 days with LLMs

- 原文链接: [Making games in Go: 3 months without LLMs vs. 3 days with LLMs](https://marianogappa.github.io/software/2025/08/24/i-made-two-card-games-in-go/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45004728)

This article is about a developer who made two card games in Go: one before using AI tools and one after. The first game, Truco, took him three months to finish because he did everything by hand, including learning some React for the user interface and using TinyGo to turn the Go backend into WebAssembly so he could host it free on GitHub Pages.

He had to solve several problems, like making the UI with little React experience and running the backend in the browser without a paid server. He used TinyGo to create smaller WASM files, which work better on mobile, and figured out how to connect the Go code to JavaScript using JSON. Even though it was slow, he finished the project, and people still play the game online.

A year later, he tried building a second game, Escoba, but this time he used a large language model (Claude) to help. He gave the AI a detailed prompt, and it refactored his Truco code for Escoba almost perfectly on the first try. The only bug was a small mistake with the append function in Go. The frontend still took a few days because React and debugging WASM in JavaScript are tricky for him.

He also shared a step-by-step guide and example code for anyone who wants to make a simple turn-based game like Tic-Tac-Toe. The backend handles the game state and possible actions, and the frontend sends actions and shows the state. He explains how to build and connect the backend and frontend, including compiling Go to WASM, passing data as JSON, and serving files locally or on GitHub Pages. He gives tips for troubleshooting, like needing to serve files over HTTP to load WASM properly.

In the comments, many people were impressed by how much faster using an LLM made the second project. Some worried that AI tools could take away jobs, but others said it lets developers focus on the fun or creative parts and skip repetitive tasks. A few pointed out that using WASM with Go is still not simple, and praised the author for sharing clear steps and code examples. Some users asked about the performance of WASM on mobile, and others wondered if the same method could work for more complex games. Several readers shared their own experiences building games with Go, React, or WASM, while a few said they still prefer to write everything by hand to really learn. Overall, most agreed that LLMs are changing how fast people can ship real projects, but learning the basics is still important.

## Trees on city streets cope with drought by drinking from leaky pipes

- 原文链接: [Trees on city streets cope with drought by drinking from leaky pipes](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2487804-trees-on-city-streets-cope-with-drought-by-drinking-from-leaky-pipes/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44986723)

This article explains that trees growing along city streets do better during droughts than trees in parks because they get water from leaky underground pipes. Scientists in Montreal studied street trees and park trees, checking samples from their trunks for special lead isotopes that show where the water comes from.

They saw that, during dry times, trees in parks lost water more quickly, but street trees kept more water. The reason is that old water pipes under streets often leak. The water from these leaks goes into the soil, and street trees use their roots to drink it. The scientists found proof by looking at lead in the tree rings—street trees had lead types that matched the city’s old pipes. Park trees did not have these kinds of lead.

The study focused on two types of maple trees. The researchers counted the rings in the trunks to learn about the trees’ water sources over time. This work shows that, even though leaking pipes waste water, they can help city trees survive in hot and dry weather. City planners might not have known about this effect before. The study suggests that fixing all leaks could have some downsides for urban trees.

In the Hacker News comments, some people were surprised that leaking pipes could help the environment in this way. A few users thought this was an example of an "unintended benefit" and joked that maybe not all leaks are bad. Others pointed out that, while leaks help some trees, they are still a problem because they waste lots of water and money. One commenter said that pipes should be fixed, but more smart watering for trees is needed.

Some users discussed if this effect happens in other cities or just Montreal. Someone with experience in city planning said that in dry countries, leaks are still seen as a big problem. Another commenter wondered if the lead in the water could harm the trees or even people. A few people debated if it’s better to have healthy trees or to save water, saying it’s a tough choice. Others just enjoyed the story, saying it’s cool how nature finds a way to use what’s around, even city leaks.

## Halt and Catch Fire Syllabus (2021)

- 原文链接: [Halt and Catch Fire Syllabus (2021)](https://bits.ashleyblewer.com/halt-and-catch-fire-syllabus/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45007414)

This article is about a website that offers a study plan based on the TV show Halt and Catch Fire, which is about people working in tech during the 1980s and 1990s. The idea is for friends or small groups to watch the show together and talk about the history of technology shown in each episode.

The curriculum has 15 classes, like a school semester, with each class focusing on a different part of the show and related tech topics. For each class, there are fun videos to watch, but they are not required. There is also a “Request for Comments” (RFC) to think about, which is a real document from the history of the Internet. Each class includes an old computer you can play with in your browser, so you can see how technology worked back then. There are themes and questions to help start group conversations. If you want to learn more, there are extra readings. The curriculum gives a short summary of what happens in the episodes and explains how it connects to real tech history. It also has links to episode summaries, so if you don’t have time to watch, you can still follow along. The site includes warnings for any episodes that might be hard for some people to watch, so groups can decide what to skip if needed. The whole project was made by Ashley Blewer, and the source code is available online.

In the comments, many people say they love Halt and Catch Fire and think it’s one of the best shows about tech. Some say they wish something like this syllabus was around when they first watched the show. Others like the idea of using TV to teach about history, saying it makes learning fun and social. A few people are happy to see real RFCs and old computers included, calling it a smart way to link fiction to real tech. Some think the show is not always accurate, but still a great way to start good conversations. There are comments from teachers who want to use this in their own classes. A few users ask if there are similar guides for other tech shows. Others wonder if you could do the course online with strangers, not just friends. Some people point out you don’t need to watch every episode, which makes it easier for busy people. Finally, a few mention that content warnings are important and show that the syllabus cares about everyone in the group.

## NASA's Juno mission leaves legacy of science at Jupiter

- 原文链接: [NASA's Juno mission leaves legacy of science at Jupiter](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-nasas-juno-probe-changed-everything-we-know-about-jupiter/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44979906)

NASA’s Juno probe went to Jupiter to learn about the planet’s secrets. The mission lasted much longer than expected and will end around September 2025, but it has already changed how scientists see Jupiter and the solar system.

Juno found that Jupiter is not what scientists thought. It has giant storms at its poles arranged in strange shapes, and its core is not hard or clear—it's more like fuzzy, mixed-up layers. Juno showed that heavy elements are in the planet’s upper atmosphere, not just in the center. The planet’s storms, like the Great Red Spot, go much deeper than anyone knew—about 300 miles down. Juno also found a new kind of lightning high in Jupiter’s clouds, caused by ammonia mixing with ice and water, making “mushballs.” The probe’s data showed Jupiter’s magnetic field is huge and messy, different from Earth’s, and comes from a deep sea of metallic hydrogen. Surprisingly, Jupiter’s core is not solid or missing, but is instead a strange, blurry mix of materials.

Juno also visited Jupiter’s moons. It took close pictures of Ganymede and Europa and studied their chemistry. Io, the most volcanic moon, was a big surprise. Juno did not find a magma ocean under Io’s surface, but saw a huge eruption, the biggest ever seen, with so much energy it could power all of humanity for a year.

To survive Jupiter’s deadly radiation, Juno orbited over the poles and kept its electronics in a titanium vault. At first, designers did not want to add a camera, but the team insisted, and the pictures became famous for their beauty.

Juno’s mission was to figure out how Jupiter formed and what that means for the whole solar system. Its discoveries are forcing scientists to rethink many old ideas about planets. Now, they are not sure how Jupiter’s core works or how its storms stay so stable.

In the Hacker News comments, many people were amazed by Juno’s long life and the technical skill needed to keep it working in such harsh radiation. Some users talked about how hard it is to build electronics that can last so long in space. Others pointed out that Juno’s images helped get the public interested in space science. A few commenters wondered about the cost and if missions like Juno are worth the money, but most agreed the new science was worth it. Some people discussed how the findings about Jupiter’s core and storms might change what we know about planet formation. Others liked the teamwork and creativity, such as adding the camera and protecting the electronics. There were also debates about what the next big space mission should be, and excitement about what Juno might still discover before it ends. Several users admired how Juno’s work inspires young people to study science and technology. Some worried about losing contact when Juno finally crashes into Jupiter, but most felt its legacy will last for many years.
