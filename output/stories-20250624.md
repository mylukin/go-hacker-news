## Fun with uv and PEP 723

- 原文链接: [Fun with uv and PEP 723](https://www.cottongeeks.com/articles/2025-06-24-fun-with-uv-and-pep-723)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44369388)

The article talks about how using Python for small scripts has become much easier with two new things: the "uv" tool and PEP 723. The author explains that before, running Python scripts with the right dependencies was hard, but now "uv" makes it fast and simple.

"uv" is a Python package manager written in Rust. It can create temporary virtual environments, install dependencies, and run scripts very quickly. The "uvx" command works like "npx" in Node.js, letting you run Python tools from packages without setting anything up first. PEP 723 is a new way to add metadata (like required Python version and dependencies) directly inside your Python script using special comments. The article gives an example of a script that lists PEP titles from the Python website and shows how you can run it with "uv" without worrying about dependencies. The author also shows a script for downloading YouTube transcripts, using "uv" and PEP 723, and explains how to make it executable on the command line.

The big idea is that now, with "uv" and PEP 723, you can write a Python script, add a few lines at the top to declare what it needs, and anyone can run it easily. This makes Python feel more like Go or Node.js for quick scripts. The author gives links for more info and says this setup opens new possibilities for Python scripting.

In the comments, many people are excited about "uv". Some say it finally makes Python scripts "just work" without manual setup, and it is extremely fast compared to pip or pyenv. Others compare it to tools in other languages, like NPM for Node.js or Cargo for Rust, and hope more languages will get similar features. Some users share tips for using "uv" in their projects or ask about the difference between Python version files and project files. There are also discussions about whether PEP 723 is just a "cool trick" or truly useful. Some wish there was a good way to pin all dependencies so scripts don't break in the future.

A few commenters mention problems with Python package management in the past and say "uv" is a big improvement. Others think things like virtual environments are still too complex compared to other languages. There are debates about whether speed comes from Rust or better design. Some warn about security risks with installing tools via shell scripts and say to read scripts before running them. A couple of people think shell scripts should stay simple and small, while others now prefer using Python for scripting thanks to "uv". Some users say "uv" still doesn't fit their workflows, or that there are still some rough edges, but most feel it is a big step forward for Python scripting.

## Writing toy software is a joy

- 原文链接: [Writing toy software is a joy](https://blog.jsbarretto.com/post/software-is-joy)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44367084)

The article talks about why writing “toy” software—small, simple programs just for fun or learning—is important and joyful. The author worries that, as AI and industry trends make programming more automated and serious, we risk losing the fun side of coding.

The main point is that building things yourself, even if they’re not perfect or useful, helps you learn deeply. The author shares a list of toy projects, like making a regex engine, a physics engine, a text editor, or even a basic operating system. These projects are not for production or making money. Instead, they are for understanding how things work, running into problems, and learning by doing. The author says to focus on the minimum code needed, avoid over-engineering, and not worry about making the software “good enough” for others. Many skills and bits of knowledge picked up from these toys come in handy later at work. The article also warns against using AI code tools for these projects, because part of the joy is struggling, making mistakes, and figuring things out yourself—not just getting answers instantly.

The top Hacker News comments were full of different views. Many people agreed that toy projects are a great way to learn and regain joy in programming, sharing their own stories about how small side projects taught them real skills. Some said toy projects helped them in job interviews or gave them confidence. Others felt the article’s time estimates for each toy project were too short, saying real life, research, and learning take longer.

A big topic in the comments was AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). Some people use LLMs as “smarter search engines,” to help look up docs or fix syntax, but don’t trust them for deep understanding. Others warned that too much reliance on AI tools might make people lose important skills over time, while a few said that AI makes it easier to start toy projects by handling boring parts like boilerplate code. There were debates over whether using AI for learning is good or bad, and some people think it depends on how you use it—asking for explanations is better than just copy-pasting code.

People also discussed whether reinventing the wheel is worthwhile. Many said rebuilding old software is good for learning, while a few argued you should focus on new ideas only. Some liked sharing their toy projects on GitHub for fun or to help with job searches. Others just wanted to code for themselves, without worrying about usefulness or popularity.

A few mentioned that today’s software world is more complex, with more tools, deployment steps, and less free time for hobby projects. Despite this, many still find joy in making small, personal tools or games, even if they never finish or share them. Overall, the comments show a wide range of experiences, but most agree that writing toy software can bring back the simple fun of programming and help you learn in ways you can’t get from just reading or using AI.

## Microsoft Releases Classic MS-DOS Editor for Linux Written in Rust

- 原文链接: [Microsoft Releases Classic MS-DOS Editor for Linux Written in Rust](https://github.com/microsoft/edit)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44372380)

Microsoft has released a new version of the classic MS-DOS Editor, now written in Rust and available for Linux and other platforms. This project, called “edit,” is inspired by the old MS-DOS text editor but has a modern look and uses input controls similar to Visual Studio Code. The goal is to make a simple, easy-to-use text editor for people who might not be comfortable with terminal editors like Vim or Emacs.

The editor is open-source under the MIT license and has gained a lot of attention, with nearly 10,000 stars on GitHub. It can be installed on Windows with WinGet and built for Linux or Mac by cloning the repo and building with Rust. The project’s README explains that “edit” is the preferred executable name, but “msedit” is also suggested to avoid conflicts with other commands. It also mentions that the editor depends optionally on the ICU library to support advanced features like Search and Replace, and gives detailed build instructions for package maintainers.

The editor pays homage to the original MS-DOS Editor, aiming to provide a familiar and simple interface. It is written almost entirely in Rust, which is known for safety and speed. The project has many contributors and is actively developed, with support for features like multiline indentation and large clipboard handling.

In the Hacker News comments, one user said the project looks fun but questioned who the target audience is. Another user pointed out that the README clearly says the goal is to make an editor for people who don’t know much about terminal editors. A third commenter was skeptical, saying that while the README gives this reason, they doubt it’s the real motivation behind the project.

Some users seem happy about bringing back a classic tool in a modern way, while others wonder if there’s a real need for it. There’s a bit of nostalgia for the old MS-DOS Editor, and some think it’s nice to have a tool that is simple and not as complex as Vim or Emacs. Others feel that the project might just be for fun or a coding exercise, rather than filling a big need. The discussion shows a mix of interest, curiosity, and doubt about who will actually use this new editor. Some people appreciate the choice of Rust for safety and portability, while others are not sure why Microsoft is doing this now. Overall, the responses cover both excitement and questions about the purpose of the project.

## Mid-sized cities outperform major metros at turning economic growth into patents

- 原文链接: [Mid-sized cities outperform major metros at turning economic growth into patents](https://www.governance.fyi/p/booms-not-busts-drives-innovation)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44372162)

This article looks at how mid-sized U.S. cities turn economic growth into new patents, using more than 2 million patents from over 700 communities studied across 40 years. The main finding is that when the local economy grows—like during oil and gas booms—these smaller cities see a strong rise in innovation, much more than big metro areas.

Most patents in the U.S. come from just a few places—5% of cities make 75% of patents. But, when there is a local economic boom, mid-sized cities double their innovation response compared to the biggest cities. For example, if oil and gas jobs double, total patents go up by 8.3%. But strangely, oil and gas companies themselves file 8.5% fewer patents during their own boom, since they focus on making money right now instead of inventing new things. The increase in patents mostly comes from people who already live there, not from newcomers. Companies make most patents, not universities or individuals.

During economic booms, jobs and wages rise. Local governments make more money, and there are more college graduates and creative workers in these towns. But the real boost comes from longtime inventors in the area becoming more productive. The best results happen in cities of about 75,000 people—not too big, not too small.

The data also shows that when the economy slows down, patent numbers fall by about the same amount. So, good times bring more innovation, and bad times cut it back. This challenges the old idea that hard times make people more creative. In fact, the study finds that more money and more local resources help people invent more, not less.

Now, looking at Hacker News comments, some readers are surprised that anyone thought busts, not booms, would drive invention. Others say that older ideas and movies often show inventors as underdogs, working hard because they have nothing left to lose. A few people point out this study is mostly about the oil industry, and wonder if it's true for other fields. One user argues that war or hardship has driven lots of past innovation, while another says that making people "work smarter with less" is just a common excuse for cost-cutting.

Some readers joke about the idea that being tough on people will magically make them more creative, and discuss how stories about innovation change over time. There’s also a note that high interest rates or budget cuts are often sold as ways to force smarter work, but the data here doesn’t really support that. Overall, many users find it logical that money and growth create good conditions for new ideas, but they also see why the myth of innovation from hardship is so strong in our culture.

## Ancient X11 scaling technology

- 原文链接: [Ancient X11 scaling technology](https://flak.tedunangst.com/post/forbidden-secrets-of-ancient-X11-scaling-technology-revealed)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44369646)

The article is about how people often say X11 can’t do DPI or fractional scaling, but the author tries it out and shows it actually can. The author sets out to draw a two-inch circle that stays the same real-world size on different monitors, no matter their resolution or size. They use OpenGL to draw the circle and get information from the X server about each screen’s pixel size and physical size. The code listens for screen changes and recalculates how big the circle should be in pixels, based on the monitor’s details. This way, when you move the window from one screen to another, the circle keeps its real size, even if the pixel count changes. The hardest part is matching up details from different X server structures, but it works. The author even runs the program on a router in another room, showing it works over the network using X11’s old remote features. They find that the only real problem is that sometimes the monitor’s reported size isn’t correct, like with their TV. To sum up, the author says you shouldn’t believe people who say something can’t be done until you try it for yourself. They end by making an on-screen ruler for fun, measuring things exactly.

In the comments, many people agree it’s smart to try things yourself, but they say the real difficulty isn’t just scaling one shape—it’s making whole UIs and all kinds of apps scale well, especially when mixing fonts, icons, and windows across screens with different DPIs. Some point out that while X11 can do this with extra work, most apps and toolkits don’t handle it well, and that’s why newer systems like Wayland are being adopted. Others say that scaling with OpenGL is easier than with the basic X11 drawing tools, and the author’s example doesn’t cover all the hard problems. There’s a lot of debate about fractional scaling (like 1.5x), with some saying it always leads to blurry or weird-looking text or icons, and others arguing that most users don’t care or even notice. Some defend X11, saying it’s old but works well for them, especially for remote use over SSH, which Wayland makes harder. Others say Windows and macOS handle mixed-DPI setups better today, but even they have issues. There’s talk about how toolkits (like Qt or GTK) need to support scaling well, and that the move to Wayland isn’t just about scaling, but about cleaning up old code and making new features easier. A few people also mention that display size info from X11 isn’t always accurate, which can be a problem. In the end, most agree that scaling is hard and messy, but trying things out and understanding how the tech works is important.

## PlasticList – Plastic Levels in Foods

- 原文链接: [PlasticList – Plastic Levels in Foods](https://www.plasticlist.org/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44366548)

PlasticList is a website that measures how much plastic and plastic chemicals are found in different foods and drinks. The site shows results for many products, including baby food, water, snacks, and even things like Starbucks drinks.

The list includes the names of plastic chemicals found, such as DEHP, BPA, and others, and gives the amount found per serving. Some foods, like formula or snacks in plastic wrappers, have higher numbers. Others, like food in glass jars, usually have lower numbers. Even foods that seem natural, like raw milk or fresh salads, can have plastic chemicals. The website warns that these numbers are only from a few samples, so results may change if more tests are done. The team does not say these results are final or suggest making big changes based only on this data. They want people to see this information as a starting point for more research. The site also shares advice for companies and has details about their testing methods. They say the presence of plastic does not always mean it is harmful, and darker colors on the chart only mean higher numbers, not higher risk.

In the comment section, many people talk about how plastic is everywhere, not just in food but also in kitchen tools, water, and even clothes. One top comment worries about plastic from pepper grinders ending up in food. Some suggest using metal or stone grinders instead. Others mention replacing plastic kitchen items with metal, glass, or bamboo. People discuss how hard it is to avoid plastic because it is used in so many parts of the food chain, from packaging to farm equipment. Some point out that even “healthy” foods, like salads or vitamins, can have plastic chemicals. Water is mentioned as a major source of plastic exposure, especially from plastic pipes or bottles. Some users argue that the real danger is not clear yet, because we do not fully understand what small amounts of plastic do to our bodies. A few say there is not enough proof that these levels are harmful, while others warn that waiting for perfect proof can be risky, as history shows with other chemicals. People debate if the limits set by the government are safe enough, and some think we should be more careful. There are also jokes and worries about “microplastic-free” products becoming a marketing trick. Overall, the comments show people are concerned, but also confused, about how much risk plastics in food really bring. Some want more action and better rules, while others think it is just one of many health worries in modern life.

## National Archives at College Park, MD, will become a restricted federal facility

- 原文链接: [National Archives at College Park, MD, will become a restricted federal facility](https://www.archives.gov/college-park)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44371169)

The National Archives at College Park, Maryland, is a large federal building that keeps important records from the U.S. government, including military files, photographs, and unique documents like the JFK Assassination Records. Starting soon, it will become a restricted federal facility, meaning only people with a clear research purpose and a researcher card can enter.

The building holds many types of records—text, images, videos, and more—from both civilian and military sources. Some items are very rare and not backed up anywhere else. To protect these records, the Archives already uses strict security: visitors are searched several times, and only certain items can be brought inside. Now, the rules are getting even stricter. All visitors must apply for a researcher card in Room 1000, show ID, and give a reason for their visit. If someone abuses the system, they can be banned from all National Archives buildings.

The article explains the process for making research appointments, using special rooms, and even consulting with staff about different types of records. There are also updates about records being moved, closed, or digitized to make them more available online. The Archives is trying to balance public access with the need to protect its unique and fragile materials.

In the comments, some people worry about what “legitimate business purpose” means. They ask if writing a book or working on a school project counts, and if the rules are too vague. Others, including people who have visited, say the process was already secure, and the new rules just move security checks to a different part of the building. Some staff say these steps help filter out casual visitors, letting employees focus on real researchers.

A few commenters think the rules are normal for rare or sensitive collections, comparing them to libraries in other countries that also require ID or proof of purpose. Others think the changes are about protecting documents from theft or damage, which has happened before. Some want more documents digitized and put online, but note that there isn’t enough money or staff to do this quickly.

There is also debate about whether these changes are political—are they meant to hide information, make government less trusted, or just save money? Some see it as a sign of growing bureaucracy or a step toward less public access, while others believe it’s just a practical response to staff shortages and security needs. A few people are surprised that anyone could just walk in before, while others argue that, as taxpayers, everyone should have easy access. Some say requiring ID or appointments is fine, but asking for a justification could be abused or used to block certain people. Overall, the comments show a split between those who worry about losing open access and those who think tighter rules are needed to protect the country’s history.

## Finding a 27-year-old easter egg in the Power Mac G3 ROM

- 原文链接: [Finding a 27-year-old easter egg in the Power Mac G3 ROM](https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/2025/06/finding-a-27-year-old-easter-egg-in-the-power-mac-g3-rom/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44365806)

A software developer found a hidden easter egg in the Power Mac G3 ROM, a secret that had been there for 27 years. The article explains how the author, while exploring the old Mac’s ROM with tools like Hex Fiend and Ghidra, noticed a hidden JPEG image and some strange text strings.

First, the author saw a resource called `HPOE` that contained a group photo—likely the Mac development team. This image was known before, but no one knew how to make it appear on the real computer. Next, the author found another clue in a resource named “Native 4.3,” which had the words “secret ROM image” and “The Team.” After searching online, the author learned that similar past Macs let you trigger easter eggs by typing and dragging special text, but this trick did not work on the G3.

So, the author used Ghidra to study the ROM’s PowerPC code. They found a function that checked for a RAM disk named “secret ROM image.” If this was found, the function would copy the hidden JPEG to the RAM disk as a file called “The Team.” The author didn’t have a G3 to test, but shared findings online, where another user, ^alex, figured out the final step: you had to create and format a RAM disk with the name “secret ROM image” to unlock the photo file. This method worked up through Mac OS 9.0.4 and may be one of the last old Mac easter eggs, as Steve Jobs reportedly banned them after returning to Apple in 1997.

In the comments, many people felt nostalgic about these old easter eggs, saying they made software feel more human and personal. Some mentioned that as software teams became bigger, it became harder to include these little secrets, and company rules now focus on safety and risk. Others argued that with so many people working on products today, it’s just not practical to credit only a few in an easter egg. A few users pointed out that security and quality control are stricter now—hidden code can be risky, and companies need to avoid surprises in their products.

Some commenters remembered fun easter eggs from other old Macs and wished for a return of more playful software. Others said that company culture changed after Jobs returned, moving away from the quirky, experimental days to a more controlled, serious approach. A debate started about whether banning easter eggs was about business needs, security, or fear of crediting the wrong people. A few said that software bloat today makes finding easter eggs harder, while some thought the discovery of old secrets is a sign of creative “computing archaeology.” In the end, many agreed these hidden surprises gave old tech a unique spirit that's mostly missing in today’s products.

## Subsecond: A runtime hotpatching engine for Rust hot-reloading

- 原文链接: [Subsecond: A runtime hotpatching engine for Rust hot-reloading](https://docs.rs/subsecond/0.7.0-alpha.1/subsecond/index.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44369642)

Subsecond is a library that lets you change Rust code in a running program without stopping it, known as hot-patching. This is most helpful for things like game engines or servers, where restarting the app each time you make a change is slow. Subsecond uses a system called ThinLinking to speed up compiling during development and works by sending function calls through a special jump table, which always points to the newest code.

To use Subsecond, you wrap the code you want to be reloadable in a `subsecond::call` function. When you change your code, an external tool compiles only the changed parts, updates the jump table, and tells your app to use the new version. Subsecond does not change your program’s memory directly, making it safer than some other tools. It works best with the Dioxus CLI, where you start your app with a special command and it auto-reloads when you edit the code.

There are some limits: Subsecond only patches the main crate (where your `main.rs` is), not other libraries. Hot-reloading global variables and statics is possible, but changing thread-local variables can cause issues. If you change the layout of structs, things can break unless the framework throws away old data and resets things. Subsecond does not yet support full workspace hot-reloading or function pointer versioning, but these may come later. The tool works on most platforms, including Linux, macOS, Windows, Android, iOS (simulator only), and WebAssembly.

In the Hacker News comments, the creator shared more details, saying Subsecond works by controlling the Rust linking step and comparing assembly code between builds. They claim fast compile-patch times (as low as 130ms) and broad platform support. One user asked if you have to wrap a lot of code in `call`, and the creator explained that usually you only need to wrap the main part, like your app’s main loop or handler. Some frameworks like Dioxus and Bevy already have Subsecond built in, so end-users don’t need to do anything extra.

Some commenters liked the idea, noting it could speed up development, especially for servers that are slow to restart. Others worried that having to wrap code in a special function is less smooth than other languages, where any function can be hot-patched without extra work. One person said they would prefer using dynamic libraries (dylibs) for reloadable code, which is a more traditional approach. Another commenter noted the current limit that only the main crate can be patched, which could force developers to change how they organize their code. Overall, the community seemed interested, but noted the trade-offs and current limits of the tool.
