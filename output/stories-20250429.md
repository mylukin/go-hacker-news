The article discusses a peculiar issue in Windows 7 where logging on was slower if you used a solid color background. This happened because Windows 7’s logon process expected a signal from the wallpaper code to proceed, but this signal was missing if no wallpaper was set, such as in the case of a solid color background.

The article explains that during login, Windows sets up your desktop by loading various system components and the desktop background. If a wallpaper was set, the system would signal readiness after loading it. However, with a solid color, this signal was absent, causing the system to wait unnecessarily for up to 30 seconds before moving past the Welcome screen. The author also mentions a similar issue with desktop icons that were hidden due to group policy, causing a similar delay. This bug was fixed a few months after it was discovered in 2009.

In the comments, users shared personal experiences with solid color backgrounds across different systems. Some noted similar issues with macOS and GNOME, where setting solid colors can be tricky or unsupported. Others discussed the broader theme of software bloat and inefficiencies, noting how newer systems, like KDE, have improved user options but still face criticism for complexity. Some users humorously shared stories about workarounds, like using a tiny image file to mimic a solid color background to avoid such bugs. There were also discussions about software development practices, with several commenters reflecting on how bugs like these highlight the importance of careful coding and testing.

The main topic of the article, "The One-Person Framework in Practice," is about using a single framework to build and maintain a software project as a solo developer. Unfortunately, the original article was not accessible, so we don't have the specific details. But from the comments, it's clear that the discussion revolves around using frameworks like Rails or Django to efficiently develop and manage apps alone.

One commenter shared their experience using Django for several apps while working full-time elsewhere. They highlighted how a simple setup and avoiding complex frontend frameworks helped them manage large-scale projects with minimal server load. Another user compared Ruby on Rails to Django, suggesting that while Rails might be superior in some ways, Python's ecosystem is hard to beat.

Some users debated the merits of Ruby versus Python, with one noting that Python is more widely adopted in domains beyond web development, like data science. Others mentioned that while Ruby is excellent for web development, Python’s package management can be cumbersome.

The conversation also touched on other frameworks like Laravel and Clojure, with some developers praising Laravel's comprehensive ecosystem. Others mentioned Elixir and Phoenix for their performance and self-contained stack.

Several comments emphasized that the success of a project often depends more on the developer's skills and decision-making rather than the framework itself. Examples were given of successful solo projects across various languages, indicating that productivity is more about how you use the tools available rather than the tools themselves.

Overall, the discussion shows a wide range of opinions and experiences, highlighting both the strengths and limitations of different frameworks while underscoring the importance of choosing a tool that fits the developer's needs and style.

## Greek Particles (1990)

- 原文链接: [Greek Particles (1990)](https://specgram.com/Babel.I.2/07.sriyatha.greek.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43828096)

The article, "Greek Particles," published in Speculative Grammarian, humorously explores the idea that many Greek particles are meaningless in speech, similar to English fillers like "um" and "uh." It suggests that classical translations often misinterpret these particles, as they were likely used more casually in spoken language. The article uses examples from both English and Greek to illustrate these fillers' syntactic positions, showing how they often interrupt the flow of speech. It claims that classicists have misunderstood Greek particles for years, treating them as if they had more significance than they might actually possess. The piece ends by arguing that much research remains, but the main ideas are clear.

In the Hacker News comments, users quickly point out that the article is satirical, suggesting that Greek particles are well-understood by linguists. One commenter, a native Greek speaker, shares how challenging it is to read ancient texts like Xenophon's due to the heavy use of particles, which can obscure meaning. Another commenter discusses how translation can lose the original tone and register, making the text seem less direct or emotional. Some readers find the satire amusing, while others note that although Greek and English have different linguistic structures, understanding the context is important for accurate translation. A few also point out how different languages use particles to convey nuances, emphasizing the complexity and richness of language.

The article talks about a new Chrome extension called "Reject Cookies" that aims to automatically reject non-essential cookies on websites. The extension was created because many users find cookie consent banners annoying, even though rejecting cookies is often just a few clicks away. There are already extensions that auto-accept cookies, like "I don't care about cookies," but this one focuses on rejecting them.

The extension uses a method to first try rejecting cookies and, if that fails, it attempts to close the cookie banner. This complies with GDPR rules, which require user consent for non-essential cookies. The extension's code is open source and uses a simple approach by targeting specific cookie consent providers. The developer shares some technical details, such as how the extension checks for common cookie consent providers and tries to click the reject button or remove the banner.

In the comments on Hacker News, users have mixed reactions. Some appreciate the effort and see it as a useful tool for privacy-conscious users. Others are skeptical, wondering if it might inadvertently block necessary cookies or break website functionality. A few users suggest using this extension alongside others like uBlock Origin for better results. There's also discussion about the complexity of managing different cookie consent systems and how they can vary between websites. Overall, the extension seems to be filling a niche need for those who prefer to reject non-essential cookies automatically.
