Hello everyone, this is the 2025-10-18 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have many interesting stories for developers and tech fans. Let’s get started.

First, we look at how to understand if your Postgres database is used more for reading or writing data. This is very important for making your app faster and more reliable. If your app is read-heavy, like a social site, you need good indexes, caching, and maybe read replicas. For write-heavy apps, like IoT loggers, you should use fast SSDs, tune how Postgres writes data, and keep indexes simple. The article gives a sample SQL query to check the ratio of reads to writes on each table. You can set what counts as “read-heavy,” for example, a 5:1 ratio. There are also tools like pg_stat_statements to track read and write queries. Most Postgres databases are read-heavy, but each app is different. In the comments, people say you must always check real stats, since guessing can be wrong. Some talk about their own databases, from analytics (which are 100:1 reads to writes) to pure logging (almost all writes). Many warn that too many indexes slow down writes, even if they help reads. Others mention new Postgres features help with write-heavy loads, but tuning is still important. One user reminds that cloud database stats can look very different at busy times. Some say slow queries often come from just a few tables, so always check your slow query logs. The main lesson: keep watching your stats and adjust as your app changes.

Next, there is a great digital collection of plant root system drawings from Wageningen University. These are detailed, old hand-drawn images showing how different plant roots grow and spread. You can search by plant name and view high-quality pictures for free. This helps researchers, teachers, gardeners, and anyone interested in plants. The drawings show clear differences between deep and shallow roots, which is useful for farming or garden design. In the comments, people are excited to see roots shown so well, since most plant books only show leaves and flowers. Some say roots are key for plant and soil health, but often ignored. Others wish for modern digital versions, but praise the artists’ skill. Many like that the collection is free and easy to use, and hope for even more search tools and info in the future.

Now, we tell the story of a group of friends who sequenced their own DNA at home for less than $2,000. They used a small device called the Oxford Nanopore MinION. First, they collected blood, which was hard with small lancets. Then, they used a DNA extraction kit and a mini centrifuge. Instead of a lab machine, they heated samples with a kettle and a bucket. The MinION reads DNA by pulling it through tiny holes and measuring electrical signals. They managed to sequence about 13% of a human genome, though some of the data was from bacteria, and some device parts were broken. The cost was about $1,100 for this experiment. In the comments, many are excited that DNA sequencing is now possible at home, though the results are not enough for real medical use. Some warn about privacy and contamination risks. Others remember when DNA sequencing was only for big labs, and are amazed at today’s low cost. There is advice to use saliva instead of blood, and requests for better guides to understand the data. People see value for education, but also worry about people misunderstanding their own DNA results.

Next up, we have Flowistry, a plugin for VSCode that helps Rust programmers focus on the code that matters. Flowistry shows how information moves inside your Rust functions. Click a variable, and it highlights only the code that affects or is affected by it. This makes reading and understanding big or complex functions much easier. You can install Flowistry from the Marketplace or build it from source, but it only supports Rust up to version 1.73 and may need extra steps on some systems. Known issues include incomplete support for some types and only working inside single functions. In the comments, many developers are excited, saying this could make code reading and debugging much easier. Some wish this was built into Rust Analyzer, but explain that Flowistry uses special compiler parts. There are concerns about support for future Rust versions and some confusion about focus results, but most users are positive and hope for more improvements.

Now, let’s talk about the history of deep residual learning in AI. Many people know ResNet, but the idea started much earlier. In 1991, Sepp Hochreiter first used residual connections in his thesis. This idea helped solve the vanishing gradient problem, making deep neural networks possible. Later, LSTM models used these connections with special “gates” to remember information over many steps. In 2015, the Highway Network added gates to feedforward networks. The famous ResNet paper came later that year, using always-open gates, and became very popular after winning the ImageNet competition. The article says ResNet and Highway Network are very similar, and more credit should go to Hochreiter, Schmidhuber, and their teams. In the comments, some agree and thank Schmidhuber for the timeline. Others say that in science, ideas often appear in different places at the same time, and credit can be messy. Some defend ResNet for making the idea practical and well known. Many agree that both the early and later work were important for deep learning’s growth.

Another story is about a free online tool called the Tinnitus Neuromodulator, found on myNoise.net. This tool helps people manage tinnitus by playing special sounds. Many users say the tool gives real relief, sometimes making their tinnitus quieter or even gone for a short time. The sounds are easy to customize, and some find it better than white noise or hearing aids. People also use it for focus, sleep, or relaxation. Not everyone finds it helpful—some say it made their tinnitus worse or wish for more options. Many users thank the creator and call the tool a lifesaver. Some use it for other problems like misophonia or ADHD. Most agree it offers real help, and they are grateful it exists.

Now we remember Yang Chen-Ning, a famous physicist and China’s first Nobel Prize winner, who has died at age 103. Yang won the Nobel Prize in 1957 with Tsung-Dao Lee for their work on “parity non-conservation.” He was one of the creators of the Yang-Mills theory, which is a key part of modern physics. Yang studied in China and the U.S., taught at Stony Brook, and later returned to China to teach and lead at Tsinghua University. He helped many young scholars and built bridges between Chinese and global science. In the comments, users praise Yang’s work, saying the Yang-Mills theory changed physics. Some share stories of how Yang inspired them. Others talk about his role in helping Chinese science grow and his long, productive life. There is some debate about his and Lee’s impacts, but most agree both were key to modern science. Many feel sad at his passing, but grateful for his life and work.

Next, we have a story about a watch called “./watch.” This watch shows off its electronic parts, like chips and wires, instead of hiding them. The design looks like computer hardware and reminds people of the command line. The name “./watch” is a play on running a program in a terminal. Many people love the idea, saying it is geeky and fun. Some worry it might be easy to break or hard to read, but most think it is a cool way to celebrate technology. Some even hope for more gadgets like this in the future.

Finally, we look at the famous Kryptos sculpture at the CIA. For 35 years, its last puzzle, K4, was unsolved. Two fans found the solution in a Smithsonian archive just as the artist planned to auction off the answer. Kryptos has four secret messages; the first three were solved long ago, but the fourth stayed a mystery. Many are amazed it took so long to find the answer, though some feel let down it was found in archives, not by solving the puzzle. There are talks about how art and cryptography mix in Kryptos, and how the search for answers can be as fun as finding them. Some hope the full solution will now be made public, and others want new puzzles to keep the spirit alive.

That’s all for today’s episode. Thank you for listening to Hacker News Daily Podcast. We hope you learned something new and enjoyed these stories. See you next time.
