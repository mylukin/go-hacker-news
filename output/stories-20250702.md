## Exploiting the IKKO Activebuds "AI powered" earbuds

- 原文链接: [Exploiting the IKKO Activebuds "AI powered" earbuds](https://blog.mgdproductions.com/ikko-activebuds/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44443919)

This article is about someone testing the security of IKKO Activebuds, which are “AI powered” earbuds that use ChatGPT. The writer bought the earbuds after seeing them online and suspected they ran Android, which turned out to be true. The device has a small screen, runs some basic apps, and connects to OpenAI’s ChatGPT with a visible logo. The audio quality was bad unless you changed the settings yourself.

The writer explored the software and found that the earbuds had Android Debug Bridge (ADB) enabled, allowing easy access from a PC. They installed the game DOOM on the earbuds and examined the apps to see how ChatGPT worked. The apps used direct API keys to communicate with OpenAI, and these keys were stored on the device, only lightly encoded. Other services connected to the device included Chinese servers for features and logging.

The companion app for these earbuds let users see chat history. The writer discovered that the app's API had almost no security: you could get chat histories just by knowing the device ID, and even create fake QR codes to link devices. If a device was already linked, it would reveal the user’s full name. The system let anyone with a device ID access sensitive information like names and chat histories. The writer tested if they could send messages to other users and found it was possible, though some protections blocked code injection.

After reporting these issues to IKKO, the company responded and took the app offline for repairs. They fixed some problems, like requiring a more secure login to view chat history. However, other issues remained, such as being able to generate QR codes and bind new devices, plus old unrotated API keys on devices. Later, the company added some extra checks and finally changed the API key, but still left some endpoints easy to use if you knew the right headers.

Commenters on Hacker News had strong opinions about this story. Some were shocked that a device sold for over 200 euros would have such weak security. Many pointed out that leaving ADB open is a basic mistake. Others joked about running DOOM on the earbuds, saying it’s a hacker tradition. Some worried that many “AI gadgets” are just cheap Android devices with little care for privacy or security. A few commenters said that storing API keys on devices is always a risk, and this shows why companies need to follow security best practices. Some criticized the company for using OpenAI branding without permission, and others found it funny that the company wanted to sponsor the writer after being exposed. Several people wondered if leaking user chat data could break privacy laws in some countries. Others praised the writer for reporting the bugs responsibly, even though the fixes were slow and incomplete. A few also discussed how easy it is to mess up security when rushing new tech products to market. Overall, commenters agreed that security must be taken seriously, especially with devices handling personal data.

- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44432571)

This article talks about a website that shows the current phase of the moon using only ASCII art—pictures made from text characters. You can see what the moon looks like right now, all in your web browser, without any images.

The site updates in real-time to show if the moon is new, full, or somewhere in between. It uses simple characters like #, %, and @ to draw the shape of the moon. The code runs in your browser, so you don’t need to download anything or install special software. The design is very simple and loads quickly, even on slow internet. The main goal is to bring a fun, retro way to check the moon’s phase, using technology that works everywhere.

The author says ASCII art is making a comeback for small, useful projects. They explain that this project was inspired by old terminal programs. Creating the moon’s shape in ASCII was a challenge, but the result is clear and easy to understand. The site also works on mobile devices and can be used anywhere.

In the Hacker News comments, many people say they like the idea and appreciate the nostalgia. Some remember seeing similar tools on old computers or BBS systems. A few users suggest adding features, like showing moonrise and moonset times or a calendar view. Others talk about how ASCII art is a good way to make things accessible and fast. Some point out that the site is a nice example of web minimalism and could be useful for teaching programming basics.

A few commenters wonder about the accuracy of the moon phase calculation, and some offer ideas for improvements, like adding color or making the ASCII art even more detailed. One user mentions the fun of sharing small web projects like this, while another warns that too many features could make the site less simple and charming. Overall, the community enjoys the project and feels it brings back memories of early computing, showing that simple ideas can still be creative and fun.

## Don’t use “click here” as link text (2001)

- 原文链接: [Don’t use “click here” as link text (2001)](https://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/noClickHere)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44442473)

This article explains why you should not use “click here” as the text for links on web pages. Instead, it says you should use link text that tells people what they will get if they follow the link.

The article gives examples. It says that “click here” does not help users understand the link, especially if they cannot see the whole sentence. Good link text should work even if someone is using a screen reader or only looking at the links on a page. For example, instead of writing “To download Amaya, click here,” it is better to write “Get Amaya.” Even better, just use the word “Amaya” as the link. The article also suggests not using verb phrases like “get Amaya” or “tell me more.” Instead, the link should be on the name or topic, like simply linking the word “Amaya.” This makes it easier for people to know what the link is about, and it helps with web accessibility for people with disabilities. The article also points to other guides and tips about writing good link text and making websites more accessible.

In the comment section, many people agree with the advice and say it is important for accessibility. Some share stories about how “click here” is confusing for people using screen readers because all the links just say “click here” and they do not know where each one goes. Others say that using meaningful link text is also better for search engines and helps with SEO. A few people think it is sometimes fine to use “click here” if the context is clear, but most believe that using clear, descriptive links is a good habit. Some commenters mention that older websites and emails still use “click here” out of habit or because it became popular a long time ago. A few users say that good link text also makes the web feel more professional. Some share that they did not know about this tip before, but now they want to change how they write links. Others explain that meaningful links help everyone, including people who scan pages quickly. A few discuss that sometimes marketing teams prefer “click here” because they think it gets more clicks, but most agree that clear links are better for everyone. Some users even mention that changing link text is a simple way to make a big difference in web usability.

## Evidence of a 12,800-year-old shallow airburst depression in Louisiana

- 原文链接: [Evidence of a 12,800-year-old shallow airburst depression in Louisiana](https://www.scienceopen.com/hosted-document?doi=10.14293/ACI.2025.0004)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44431638)

This article tells about a possible cosmic airburst that happened about 12,800 years ago in Louisiana. Scientists found signs near Perkins, Louisiana, that suggest a small object from space exploded in the air and made a shallow crater.

The team studied a strange 300-meter-long lake with a raised rim, which looked different from other lakes in the area. In the soil around the lake, they found huge amounts of tiny melted balls (spherules), pieces of shock-melted glass, and grains of quartz that had been changed by high pressure and temperature. These are all signs often linked to impacts from space. Using different dating methods, like radiocarbon and argon-argon dating, they found most of these materials formed around 12,800 years ago—the same time as the Younger Dryas Boundary, a sudden cold event in Earth’s history.

They used many tools to study the spherules and glass: optical and electron microscopes, chemical tests, and more. They learned that the spherules and glass contain elements like iron, silicon, calcium, and aluminum, and that some spherules have shapes and features only seen in known impact sites. The glass and spherules are mostly found in and near the lake, and the deepest layers of these materials are in the center, just like you’d expect if something exploded above and dumped debris into the hole. There are also special carbon-rich spherules and metal flakes with unusual chemistry, pointing to material from space. They found shocked quartz, which only forms under very high pressure, not from normal Earth processes.

The team also looked at other possible explanations: human industry, volcanoes, lightning, natural gas blowouts, or river action. But the chemistry and features didn’t match any of these. The materials are buried deep, and there were no factories nearby, so people couldn’t have made them. Volcanic activity and lightning can’t produce the same high-pressure signs in quartz. The amounts and kinds of melted minerals suggest temperatures much higher than what happens in normal Earth events.

They also ran models that show a low-altitude airburst—where a comet or asteroid explodes just above the ground—could create a shallow crater and spread melted debris like they saw. The magnetic readings around the lake matched patterns seen at other impact sites, and the shape of the lake and its “wings” looked like blast features from known airbursts, like Tunguska in Russia.

Turning to the Hacker News comments, some readers were excited about the discovery and asked if this could help explain the sudden cooling at the Younger Dryas. Others pointed out that the Younger Dryas impact theory is still debated and that past claims about impacts have had mixed reviews. Some users asked for more evidence, saying that finding a real crater and confirming the age of the materials would be key.

A few commenters worried about the risk of similar airbursts happening today and discussed how hard it is to spot small objects from space before they hit. Some people explained the science behind shocked quartz and why it’s a strong sign of impacts, while others asked how the team ruled out other causes, like lightning or human activity.

Some readers wondered if the raised rim and lake could have formed from old river channels or natural sinkholes, but others argued that the combination of glass, spherules, and shocked quartz is too unusual for normal Earth processes. There was also discussion about the dating methods and whether mixing of old and new materials in the soil could affect the results.

Overall, the comments showed both excitement and caution. Many liked the detailed work, but wanted more proof before calling this a confirmed impact site. Some were hopeful this would reopen the discussion about the Younger Dryas impact theory, while others remained skeptical until more studies are done.

## Show HN: CSS generator for a high-def glass effect

- 原文链接: [Show HN: CSS generator for a high-def glass effect](https://glass3d.dev/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44445238)

This article is about a new CSS generator called Glass3D that helps you make a glass-like effect for your website elements. You can adjust settings like blur, brightness, color, and texture, and see the changes live before copying the code.

The generator uses modern CSS features, such as the backdrop-filter property, to create the glass effect. You can play with sliders for blur, brightness, and saturation. There are also settings for color, using HSL (hue, saturation, lightness), so you can pick any color you want. The effect includes a texture layer, which uses a transparent PNG to add a “frosted” look. All your choices are shown right away on the page. After you finish, you can copy the CSS code and use it on your own projects. The sample code uses custom properties (variables) for easy changes later. It also uses multiple box shadows to give the glass a more 3D, realistic look. The design is responsive and works in most modern browsers. The CSS code is simple to use—just add the .glass3d class to any element. There is no JavaScript, so it’s lightweight.

People in the comments liked how easy the tool is to use and how nice the results look. Some users said it saves time because you don’t have to tweak CSS by hand. A few people pointed out that the glass effect needs support for the backdrop-filter property, which does not work in all browsers (like some versions of Firefox). Others liked that the code is clean and uses CSS variables. Some users wondered if the tool could export code for frameworks like React or Vue. One person asked about accessibility, worrying if the glass effect could make text hard to read. Someone suggested using less blur for better performance on slower computers. A few commenters shared links to their own CSS glass effects and compared results. There was a suggestion to add more textures or color presets. Overall, most people found the tool useful and fun to play with.

## The Zen of Quakerism (2016)

- 原文链接: [The Zen of Quakerism (2016)](https://www.friendsjournal.org/the-zen-of-quakerism/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44413076)

This article talks about how Quakerism and Zen Buddhism both use quiet contemplation to find peace and understanding. The writer grew up as a Quaker and later learned about Buddhism as a way to help with depression.

The writer explains that both religions use silence and meditation. As a child, Quaker meetings were hard for them because they did not know how to focus, so they would count things to pass the time. Later, Buddhist meditation taught them to count their breaths and focus their mind and body, which made silent Quaker meetings easier to handle. Zen meditation also includes many types, like walking, chanting, and even eating or cleaning meditation. While meditating was not always easy, it helped bring peace and calm to the rest of their life.

Zen and Quakerism are different in some ways. Zen focuses on awakening to your “True Nature” and promises a special experience called enlightenment, which inspires people to meditate. In Quakerism, the goal is not a big moment of awakening but to create peace and do good in the world. When the writer moved back to New Jersey, they returned to Quaker meetings and found strong community and support. Quaker meetings also have a business side, where people make group decisions. This process can be hard, but it teaches patience and helps people let go of their own opinions, which can be transformative, much like Zen’s approach to the ego.

The writer says both Zen and Quakerism help people let go of their egos and find peace. Zen speaks openly about seeking awakening, while Quakerism focuses more on kindness, honesty, and community. The writer thinks Quakers could learn from Buddhists about how awareness and presence can change our feelings and actions. They find that their Zen training makes Quaker worship even more meaningful, and both ways of sitting in silence can be seen as a form of enlightenment.

In the comment section, some readers liked how the article connects Quaker practices with Zen meditation and said they also find value in both. Others pointed out that Quaker meetings can be hard for newcomers because there are few instructions on how to sit or what to do. Some commenters shared that silent worship in Quakerism can feel awkward at first but becomes more comfortable with time or guidance. A few noted that Quakerism and Zen both focus on direct experience, not just beliefs or words. Others discussed differences, saying Quakerism is more about social action, while Zen is more about personal awakening. Some liked the idea that both paths help people let go of their egos. One reader wondered if mixing practices takes away from the traditions, but others felt combining them can be helpful. Many agreed that bringing mindfulness into daily life, not just meditation, is important. Overall, readers appreciated the honest sharing of personal experience and the idea of learning from other traditions.

## The Evolution of Caching Libraries in Go

- 原文链接: [The Evolution of Caching Libraries in Go](https://maypok86.github.io/otter/blog/cache-evolution/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44414630)

This article looks at how caching libraries for the Go programming language have changed over time. It explains different ways to store cached data in Go, and reviews the most popular libraries, talking about their good and bad points.

The article starts by comparing two types of cache: on-heap and off-heap. On-heap caches use the Go memory manager, which means they can slow down when the garbage collector runs. Off-heap caches use their own memory, which avoids this slow down, but they’re harder to use and often have fewer features. Most of the article focuses on on-heap caches, which are more common in Go projects.

Early Go caching libraries were simple and used basic locking. This made them slow on multi-core computers. Popular strategies for choosing what to keep in the cache, like LRU (least recently used) and LFU (least frequently used), had problems with real-world data patterns. More advanced ways to manage cache could improve speed and hit rate—the number of times the cache returns what you want.

Ristretto came out in 2019 and quickly became the top Go cache. It used some smart ideas from Java’s Caffeine library. Ristretto was fast and had a way to handle different entry sizes, but it also had problems. Some changes broke older code, it used a cache strategy that didn’t work well for all workloads, and it had bugs that were never fixed. Under heavy use, Ristretto could skip adding new items, making the hit rate worse. It also didn’t protect against stampede (many requests for the same data at once) and sometimes mixed up keys.

Theine, released in 2023, improved on Ristretto by using an even smarter cache algorithm from Caffeine. It was faster, had a high hit rate for any workload, and offered good protection against cache stampede. But it had its own issues: it didn’t scale as well with many CPUs, it used more memory, and it missed some features like bulk loading and async refresh.

Otter v1 was created to fix problems with Ristretto. It was very fast, used less memory, and only allocated resources for features you actually used. But its advanced API had some design mistakes, and it didn’t work as well as Theine or Ristretto for certain data patterns. It also lacked loading and refreshing features.

Sturdyc, released in 2024, was the first Go cache to add loading, refreshing, and bulk operations. But it was slower, had a weak cache policy, and only worked with string keys. It also exposed internal details that might confuse users.

Otter v2 aimed to combine the best ideas from other caches. It brought together high speed, high hit rates, loading and refreshing, and a flexible API. It borrowed a lot from Caffeine’s design, and added special features like pinning entries and protection against hash attacks. The main downside is that it’s new and hasn’t been used as much in real-world projects yet.

In the comments, many users agreed that Caffeine (in Java) is very well respected, and they are excited to see similar ideas coming to Go. Some people say they still use Ristretto because it’s stable enough for their needs, while others have switched to newer options like Theine or Otter for better performance. A few users pointed out that cache choice depends a lot on your workload—what works best for a web server might not work best for a database. Some said they care most about simple APIs, while others want advanced features like stampede protection or custom expiration. There were also debates about whether off-heap caches are worth the trouble in Go, since most teams just want something easy to use. People liked that Otter v2 focuses on flexibility and learning from past mistakes, but some are waiting to see how it performs in production before switching. Overall, readers enjoyed the detailed look at each library’s trade-offs and thanked the author for sharing real-world experience.

## Gene therapy restored hearing in deaf patients

- 原文链接: [Gene therapy restored hearing in deaf patients](https://news.ki.se/gene-therapy-restored-hearing-in-deaf-patients)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44444626)

A new study shows that gene therapy helped deaf people hear again. The therapy was tried on ten patients in China who had a rare genetic problem called OTOF mutation, which stops the ear from sending sound signals to the brain.

Doctors used a virus to carry a working OTOF gene into the inner ear, through a small injection. Most patients started to hear better after only one month. After six months, all ten patients could hear much softer sounds than before. Younger kids, ages five to eight, got the best results, but even adults improved. For example, a seven-year-old girl could talk with her mother after four months. The treatment was safe, with no serious side effects—some patients had fewer white blood cells, but nothing dangerous happened.

This is the first time the therapy was tested on both children and adults. The scientists feel hopeful and want to try this kind of therapy on other more common deafness genes in the future, like GJB2 and TMC1. The work was done by teams in China and Sweden, with support from a company making the therapy.

People on Hacker News had strong reactions. Many were excited and said this could change lives for deaf people. Some pointed out that fixing hearing early, especially in children, is important for learning to talk. A few users worried about the long-term safety of using viruses for gene therapy and want more follow-up. Others asked if this therapy could help other causes of deafness, like age-related hearing loss or ear damage, but commenters explained this treatment only helps people with specific gene problems.

Some users talked about the cost and hoped gene therapy would become cheaper and more common over time. A few shared stories about deaf friends and families, saying this research is very meaningful. There were also questions about ethics, and if gene therapy will one day be used for things other than health, but most agreed that helping people hear is a good use. Overall, people felt hopeful and curious about what comes next.

## Escher's art and computer science

- 原文链接: [Escher's art and computer science](https://github.com/gritzko/librdx/blob/master/blog/escher.md)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44432142)

This article talks about how Escher’s art connects to building complex software systems, using the author’s own project, librdx, as an example. Escher was a Dutch artist famous for his detailed, mathematical art, which the author sees as a metaphor for the process of software creation.

The author explains that librdx is a complicated but minimal library: it works as a data format like JSON, a binary format, a key-value store, a local sync system, and a cryptographic data store, all at once. The writer compares building software to Escher’s art, where things loop and build on themselves, like in Escher’s “Drawing Hands” picture. For example, the author built tools with the tools he just made, leading to complex, circular dependencies—like using a parser generator to make its own parser.

The article also talks about tuples in librdx, which are simple but very powerful, letting you make maps, sets, records, and even “tombstones” for deleted data. The author describes how the number of interactions between parts in a system grows quickly, so keeping things simple (using C instead of C++ or Rust) helps. Even then, strange bugs can happen, but over time, the code becomes stable and reliable, almost like magic.

A key idea is that good systems “order themselves”—if you add rules and good naming conventions, the code stays clean as it grows. For example, the author uses special function names to explain what each function does, making up for C’s lack of methods. The article also suggests focusing on a few key parameters in your code and letting the rest be decided by those, which keeps things simple and easy to understand.

The writer says that building good software takes careful decisions and experience, not just quick “vibe coding.” Sometimes, the true lessons are hard to explain, and you only learn them by doing.

In the Hacker News comments, some readers point out that Escher’s art has inspired not just code, but also math and logic puzzles. Others talk about how recursion and self-reference in Escher’s work are like bootstrapping in software, such as compilers building themselves. Some people agree that good naming and clear rules help software projects stay healthy, while others warn that too many rules or clever tricks can make things confusing for new developers.

A few commenters share their own experiences with building tools that use themselves, saying it feels both strange and powerful—just like Escher’s art looks impossible but makes sense when you study it. Some debate whether C really keeps things simple, since it can lead to hard-to-find bugs, while others prefer it for its minimalism.

One user mentions that libraries like librdx are valuable because they try to combine many features without becoming too big or slow. Another reader wonders if using more modern languages would help or hurt projects like this. There are also jokes about Escher’s endless staircases being like debugging code: you think you’re getting closer, but you end up back where you started.

Overall, readers enjoy seeing how art and programming overlap, and many say the article gives them a new way to think about both.
