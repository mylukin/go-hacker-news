## Exploring PostgreSQL 18's new UUIDv7 support

- 原文链接: [Exploring PostgreSQL 18's new UUIDv7 support](https://aiven.io/blog/exploring-postgresql-18-new-uuidv7-support)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45593358)

PostgreSQL 18 now supports a new type of ID called UUIDv7, which helps fix problems with older random IDs like UUIDv4. The article explains why using UUIDs as primary keys used to be slow and how UUIDv7 makes things better.

UUIDv7 is different because it includes a timestamp in the ID. This means IDs are created in order based on time, not randomly. The article gives an example of making two tables: one with UUIDv4 and one with UUIDv7. When adding 10,000 rows, the table with UUIDv7 is faster. This is because random UUIDv4 values make the database work harder to keep indexes in order, causing more page splits and cache problems. UUIDv7, with its time-based sorting, allows the database to insert rows more smoothly, like with auto-incrementing numbers. It also makes sorting easier, so you might not need a separate timestamp column.

UUIDv7 is now supported in many programming languages, like Python 3.14, and it uses the same format everywhere. You can check that the version is the same in both Python and Postgres.

However, the article warns that UUIDv7 is not great for public IDs, because the timestamp in the ID can show when a record was created. This could be a privacy problem if users see these IDs. Attackers might use this information to guess things about your business. So, it’s best to use UUIDv7 for internal database keys and use random IDs like UUIDv4 for anything users can see.

If you want to switch from UUIDv4 to UUIDv7, you need to plan carefully. You have to make sure all your systems and indexes can handle the new format, and your computers need to have their clocks in sync. Also, remember to update any systems that expect the old type of ID.

In the comments, some users are excited about the performance boost and the idea of having naturally sorted IDs. They like that UUIDv7 makes big inserts faster and helps with index efficiency. Others worry about privacy and say leaking timestamps in IDs could be risky, especially in public APIs. Some suggest using UUIDv7 for internal use only and sticking to UUIDv4 or other random IDs for public data. A few users share tips about clock synchronization and warn that if the system clock is wrong, the IDs could get messed up. There's also debate about whether the benefits are worth the trouble of migrating, especially for smaller projects. Some point out that for many apps, regular integer IDs are still the simplest and fastest choice. Finally, a few people mention that other databases and platforms are also starting to support UUIDv7, which makes switching easier in the future.

## Claude Skills are awesome, maybe a bigger deal than MCP

- 原文链接: [Claude Skills are awesome, maybe a bigger deal than MCP](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/16/claude-skills/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45619537)

Anthropic has launched Claude Skills, a new way to give Claude AI special abilities through simple files and scripts. These skills are folders with instructions, code, and resources that Claude can load when needed, making it better at tasks like working with Excel or following brand rules.

A skill is just a Markdown file that tells Claude how to do something, with extra scripts if needed. For example, there’s a skill to make GIFs for Slack, which checks file size and makes sure the GIF is ready for Slack use. The process is easy: enable the skill, give a prompt, and Claude uses the skill’s code to create the result. The skill system is efficient because Claude only loads the full instructions if the task calls for it, saving memory and speed.

Skills require Claude to have access to a coding environment with a file system and the ability to run scripts. This is similar to how ChatGPT Code Interpreter and other coding tools work. The author says skills are simple to create and very powerful, but they do raise safety concerns—AI needs to run in a safe sandbox to avoid risks.

Skills can turn Claude from just a coding tool into a “general agent,” able to automate all kinds of computer tasks. For example, you could make a data journalism agent that loads census data, processes it, and publishes the results, all by adding a few skill files.

The article compares Skills to the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a popular way to give LLMs more context. MCP often uses too many tokens, leaving less room for actual work, while Skills are more efficient. Skills are easier to share and use—just drop a folder in, and any model with a coding agent can use it. The design is so simple that the author expects a big boom in Skills development.

Some people say Skills are too basic, but the author thinks their simplicity is their strength. Unlike MCP, which is a complex protocol, Skills are just Markdown and scripts—easy for LLMs to use. This matches how LLMs work best: give them clear instructions and let them figure it out.

In the Hacker News comments, some users are excited about how easy it is to add new skills with just a Markdown file, seeing this as a step toward real software agents. Others worry about security—giving AIs access to coding environments could be risky if not sandboxed well. A few think this is just a smarter way to do what plugins and tool calls already offered, but they appreciate that Skills are open and reusable across different models.

People debate if this will make MCP obsolete. Some say MCP still has uses for sharing bigger context or structured data, while others agree that Skills are faster and easier for most coding tasks. There are also questions about how Skills will be shared, versioned, and managed—will there be a “Skill Store” like app stores? Some see the simplicity as a double-edged sword: easy to use, but maybe too limited for very complex workflows.

Overall, the community is interested and positive, but they want to see how safe, powerful, and flexible Skills will be in real use. Many say this could push LLMs into new areas of automation, but only if the security and usability challenges are solved.

## US car repossessions surge as more Americans default on auto loans

- 原文链接: [US car repossessions surge as more Americans default on auto loans](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/17/us-car-repossessions-economy)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45622157)

US car repossessions are going up fast because more people cannot pay their car loans. This is making banks and the whole finance industry worried about what could happen next in the economy.

The article says that two big car-related companies, Tricolor and First Brands, just went bankrupt. Tricolor is a used car seller and lender for people with bad credit, and First Brands sells auto parts. The head of JPMorgan, a big bank, warned that there might be more problems coming. Repo companies, which take back cars from people who do not pay, say they are very busy now. Sub-prime auto loans (loans to people with low credit) are seeing the most trouble. Some lenders are giving fewer loans or changing how they work because they are having problems with people not paying.

The article explains that car loans are the third biggest kind of consumer debt in the US, after home and student loans. Most new cars and many used cars are bought with loans. During the pandemic, car prices and loan amounts went up a lot. Now, the average monthly payment for a car is more than $750. In 2024, 1.73 million cars were repossessed, the most since 2009. More people are late with payments than any time in the past 30 years. Some experts say car loan problems often show that the economy is getting worse for regular people, because people usually try very hard to pay their car loans so they can keep working.

To stop repossessions, lenders are trying to change loans or give people more time, but that might just delay the problem. Many people bought expensive cars during the pandemic with help from government checks, but now they cannot keep up with the high payments, plus the cost of rent, groceries, and everything else. Some big lenders have even been fined for giving out risky loans to people they knew probably could not pay.

Taking back cars is getting harder and sometimes more dangerous, with repo workers needing special training to stay safe. If the economy gets worse or government help stops, even more people could lose their cars. Some experts say that while these company failures might not mean a big crisis, they are a warning sign for the future.

In the Hacker News comments, some users say this shows how car prices and loans got out of control during the pandemic. Others point out that many lenders gave out loans they knew were risky, just to make money in the short term. A few users share that owning a car in the US is almost required for most jobs, so losing a car can be life-changing. Some people argue that the problem is not just the loans, but also high car prices, expensive insurance, and the lack of good public transportation. There are comments about how lenders often do not check if a person can really pay, and some users call the system “predatory.” Others mention that this is not as big as the housing crisis in 2008, but still a warning. Some developers discuss how tech and data are used by lenders to find and target risky customers. A few people ask if there will be changes in laws or rules to stop this, while others are doubtful. Some users share personal stories of friends or family who had cars repossessed, saying it was very hard to recover. Overall, the comments show worry about people’s finances, anger at lenders, and questions about the future of the US economy.

## Live Stream from the Namib Desert

- 原文链接: [Live Stream from the Namib Desert](https://bookofjoe2.blogspot.com/2025/10/live-stream-from-namib-desert.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45615931)

This article talks about a live camera feed from a water hole in the Namib Desert in Namibia. The author enjoys watching the stream each morning and shares why it is special. The camera shows many wild animals coming to drink water, such as zebras, ostriches, oryx, warthogs, wildebeest, jackals, foxes, hyenas, hares, hartebeest, giraffes, springbok, elephants, and more. The author points out that Namibia is six hours ahead of the U.S. East Coast, so it’s hot there when he watches in the morning. He says this is a nice way to start the day, seeing animals in their natural habitat. He even suggests that school teachers could use this live stream in classrooms to help children learn about animals and nature.

People in the comments seem very happy about the live stream. Some use simple words like “awesome,” “amazing,” or “nice” to show their excitement. Others shout out animals they see, like “ZEBRA!” or “PORCUPINE!!!!” One person makes a fun joke, writing “slurp slurp,” imagining the animals drinking water. Another commenter shares a link to a different nature camera, saying it’s not as exotic as Namibia, but still fun to watch. These comments show that people enjoy watching animals and feel connected even from far away. Some think this is a great way to start the day, while others see it as a fun tool for learning. The short, excited replies show how much people like simple joys—watching wildlife, sharing the moment, and maybe learning something new.

## The pivot

- 原文链接: [The pivot](https://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2025/10/the-pivot-1.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45621074)

This article talks about how 2025 is a turning point for the world, much like 1968 was for the last century. The author, Charlie Stross, says we are living through a big change in how humans get and use energy, moving away from oil and coal to solar power and renewables.

He explains how, for hundreds of years, people used muscle, wind, and water for energy, and then coal and oil took over. This led to wars, pollution, and problems like climate change. Now, solar panels have become cheap and easy to make, especially in China, which is moving faster than most countries to clean energy. Europe is also getting over half its electricity from renewables, helped by the war in Ukraine, which made Russian gas less reliable.

The article points out that fossil fuel companies are afraid because as renewables take over, their oil, coal, and gas become “stranded assets”—worthless stuff they can’t sell. Electric cars, trains, and even e-bikes are becoming normal, but some things, like big airplanes and ships, are harder to electrify. Farming is in trouble because climate change is making weather less predictable and crops can’t handle too much heat. There are new ways to grow food, but nothing is certain, and the global food system is not very strong.

Stross also talks about “enshittification,” where big tech companies and platforms get worse for users and only care about making fast money. He says our economic and political systems aren’t built for this kind of change, and the rich don’t want to give up power, so they fight to keep things the same. Moore’s Law—the idea that computers get much more powerful every year—is slowing down, which means the tech industry and venture capital may face a crash, especially with AI hype at its peak.

He finishes by saying that the world’s problems are all linked: energy, climate, politics, and the economy. If we don’t change fast, things could get much worse, but if we make it through this decade, we might have a good chance in the 2030s.

Commenters had a lot to say. Some agree that a big change is happening, but worry about who will be hurt most—like farmers losing money or people who can’t afford solar panels because of government rules. Others discuss how crops might adapt (or not) to heat, and how new plants or ways of farming could help, but it won’t be easy. There’s debate over whether population decline will help or hurt, and if robots or AI will really solve problems like elder care. Some say the transition away from fossil fuels is messy but needed, while others warn that even renewables have costs and hidden problems, like waste and mining for materials.

Many talk about politics, saying the US and UK are losing their place in the world, and trust in governments and tech is low. Some think the tech crash is overblown, and AI is still useful, while others say it’s a bubble ready to burst. People also worry about the spread of “bad” business models that hurt users and workers. There are calls for more realistic, local solutions and for leaders who can face the new problems directly. Overall, the comments show worry, hope, anger, and lots of debate about how this “pivot” year will shape the next decades.

## PlayStation 3 Architecture (2021)

- 原文链接: [PlayStation 3 Architecture (2021)](https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-3)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45576536)

The article explains how the PlayStation 3 was built, focusing on its very special hardware design. Sony wanted the PS3 to be a big step forward in game consoles, using new ideas and powerful chips.

The heart of the PS3 is the Cell Broadband Engine, made by Sony, IBM, and Toshiba. This chip has one main core (the PPE) and eight helper cores (the SPEs), but usually only six are used for games. The main core is like a regular CPU, but the helpers are really good at vector math, which is important for graphics and physics. The Cell chip connects all its parts with a fast ring bus, letting data move quickly between them. The PS3 uses a special type of RAM called XDR that is faster than normal RAM, but there is only 256 MB of it. The system also has a hard drive for extra storage.

For graphics, the PS3 uses a chip from Nvidia called RSX. This is based on the GeForce 7800 GTX from PCs but changed for the PS3. It has its own 256 MB of video RAM and can also use the main RAM, though that is slower. The RSX handles 3D graphics, works with the Cell chip, and has many small parts to make pictures and effects look better. The console outputs video through HDMI, which was new for many people at the time.

Unlike older consoles, the PS3 does not have a special chip just for sound. Instead, audio is done in software using the Cell's helper cores. The PS3 also has many ways to connect to other devices: USB ports, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and a memory card reader. Early models could even play PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 1 games using extra chips for backward compatibility, but these were later removed to save money.

The PS3 runs a complex operating system with many layers for security, updates, and protecting games from being copied. There are strict rules about how software runs, and much of the system is locked down to stop hacking. The OS uses several types of storage, including flash memory and a hard drive, and has a special boot process with many steps for security. The user interface, called XMB, was designed to be easy to use on a TV.

People on Hacker News had a lot to say about this architecture. Some thought the Cell processor was very impressive, but too hard to program, which made game development slow and difficult. Others said the PS3 was ahead of its time, but that this made it challenging for smaller studios to release games on it. A few commenters remembered that multiplatform games often ran worse on the PS3 than on Xbox 360, because developers could not easily use all the power of the Cell chip.

Some readers liked the PS3’s hardware for its flexibility and power, while others saw its complexity as a problem. People discussed how Sony’s early focus on custom hardware is very different from newer consoles, which use more standard PC parts. A few mentioned that the PS3’s security was eventually broken, leading to homebrew and piracy, but it took longer than with other consoles. Many agreed that the PS3 had great exclusive games, thanks to studios that took time to master the hardware. Others noted that the move away from special hardware in newer consoles makes game development easier, but maybe less exciting.

## The Wi-Fi Revolution (2003)

- 原文链接: [The Wi-Fi Revolution (2003)](https://www.wired.com/2003/05/wifirevolution/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45556104)

This article talks about the rise of Wi-Fi in 2003 and how it changed the way people use the Internet. It explains that Wi-Fi made it possible to get fast Internet in homes, businesses, and public places without cables.

Wi-Fi is a wireless technology that sends Internet signals through the air. It is cheap, easy to set up, and works well. A small device can cover a whole house, and anyone with a laptop or phone can connect. Wi-Fi does not need special permission or expensive licenses, unlike old cellphone networks. It uses open radio frequencies, which are free for everyone. This makes Wi-Fi a big shift from the old way of controlling the airwaves.

Wi-Fi grew very fast—millions of people started using it at home, in coffee shops, airports, and parks. Companies and even neighbors began sharing Wi-Fi signals. Soon, many devices would have Wi-Fi built in: phones, music players, and cameras. Big companies were surprised because Wi-Fi challenged their expensive business plans.

The article explains the main Wi-Fi standards: 802.11b (the first, slower one), 802.11a (faster, different frequency), and 802.11g (faster and compatible with b). Wi-Fi uses smart ways to send signals, like spread spectrum, so many devices can share the same air without problems.

The future of Wi-Fi, the article says, is about making it work everywhere, linking home devices, bringing fast Internet to more people, and mixing with cell phones. Some people want to use Wi-Fi to cover whole neighborhoods or cities, and maybe one day, a single device will switch between Wi-Fi and cell networks without the user noticing.

Many people helped push Wi-Fi forward: engineers, business founders, government officials, and activists. Some worked on making Wi-Fi chips smaller and cheaper. Others set up free public Wi-Fi in parks or tried to change laws so more people could use the airwaves. There were also ideas for new ways to use wireless, like devices talking to each other directly, or spreading Internet to poor areas.

In the comment section, many users remember how exciting it was to set up their first Wi-Fi networks. Some say Wi-Fi gave them freedom to use laptops anywhere at home, and it felt magical. Others point out early problems, like bad security and interference from other devices. Some users discuss how Wi-Fi changed work, letting people work in cafes or public spaces.

A few commenters say Wi-Fi helped people in rural or poor areas get online, especially when wired Internet was too expensive. Others think the early days were more open and fun, but now big companies control many public networks. There are debates about the “open spectrum” idea—some think it could make Internet cheaper and more available, while others worry about interference and quality.

Some readers praise people who built community Wi-Fi networks, while others remember the risks of leaving Wi-Fi open for anyone. Several users discuss technical details, like the differences between the Wi-Fi standards and how fast they really were. A few people say that, over time, Wi-Fi became so common that most people now take it for granted. Finally, some wonder what the next big change in wireless might be, and if new “open” technologies could shake things up again.

## Intercellular communication in the brain through a dendritic nanotubular network

- 原文链接: [Intercellular communication in the brain through a dendritic nanotubular network](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adr7403)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45617819)

Scientists found that brain cells can talk to each other using very thin tubes, called dendritic nanotubes. These nanotubes connect different brain cells and help them share information, even if they are not touching.

The article explains that these nanotubes are much thinner than usual cell connections. They let small things, like molecules or signals, move from one cell to another. This means brain cells can share messages in new ways, not just through regular synapses. The researchers saw these nanotubes in mouse brains and in brain cells grown in labs. They used special microscopes to see the tiny tubes. The nanotubes can reach between far cells, not just neighbors. Sometimes, the tubes can even carry bigger things, like parts of a cell. This kind of sharing may help brain cells work together better. Scientists think this nanotube network might be important for learning or fixing problems in brain diseases. The new finding changes what we know about how brain cells talk to each other.

In the comments, some people are very excited about the discovery. They say it could help us understand brain diseases, like Alzheimer’s, in a new way. Others ask if these nanotubes could move harmful things between cells, not just good things. A few people wonder if this means our brains are even more complex than we thought. Some comment that this kind of finding shows how little we still know about the brain. Others point out that these nanotubes are also seen in other parts of the body, not just the brain. There are questions about how common these nanotubes are in humans, since the research used mice. Some people are curious if this will lead to new treatments or drugs. Others want to see more research before getting too excited. A few users talk about the technical challenges of seeing such small things in the brain. Some share links to older studies about nanotubes in cells. Overall, the comments show a mix of excitement, questions, and careful thinking about what this means for brain science.

## Asking AI to build scrapers should be easy right?

- 原文链接: [Asking AI to build scrapers should be easy right?](https://www.skyvern.com/blog/asking-ai-to-build-scrapers-should-be-easy-right/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45620653)

The article explains how Skyvern, an open source AI tool, now lets AI write and maintain its own code for web scraping, making automations faster and cheaper. Skyvern turns prompts into browser automations for tasks like filling out forms, downloading invoices, and making purchases.

The team thought it would be easy for AI to generate scraper code, but they faced two big problems: people often give unclear instructions, and websites are messy and unpredictable. For example, some buttons are hidden, or the website changes its layout or goes offline. At first, Skyvern kept an AI agent in the loop for every run, but this was slow and costly. The breakthrough was to use “reasoning models,” which help the AI agent write code similar to what a human engineer would create, and then only use the AI if something unusual happens.

The process now has two steps: Explore mode, where the agent learns how a website works and records what it does, and Replay mode, where it runs a fast, simple script based on that learning. During Explore mode, Skyvern figures out not just what to click, but why, so it can recover if things change. For example, if a button moves, Skyvern can look for it by its purpose, not just its position. In Replay mode, it uses this plan for faster, more reliable automation, and only calls the AI again if something new happens.

Skyvern’s new approach works for many real-world cases: downloading invoices from many different portals, making purchases on vendor sites, scraping data from old dashboards, and filling out government forms. The new method made automations 2.3 times faster and 2.7 times cheaper, and runs are now much more reliable.

There are still some challenges. For example, Skyvern doesn’t yet learn from groups of failed runs to make its scripts better for everyone, and it still relies on the AI for every page read when extracting data. The team also wants to make it easier for developers to use these features in their own projects.

In the comments, some people are impressed by the technical progress, saying the “explore and replay” pattern is clever and makes web scraping easier and less fragile. Others mention that government and utility websites are especially hard to automate because they often change or break, so having a system that can recover is important. Some developers point out that relying on AI for every step can be expensive and slow, so the switch to deterministic code is a big improvement. A few users share their own struggles with scraping, saying that ambiguous requirements and unexpected website changes are common problems, and they like how Skyvern’s “intent” system tries to handle that. There’s also talk about whether these tools will keep working as websites add more anti-bot features. Some commenters are cautious, warning about the legal and ethical risks of scraping certain sites. Others are excited about open source options and want to try Skyvern for their own automations. Finally, some people ask about integrating Skyvern with other tools or APIs, hoping it will save them time in their daily work.

## EVs are depreciating faster than gas-powered cars

- 原文链接: [EVs are depreciating faster than gas-powered cars](https://restofworld.org/2025/ev-depreciation-blusmart-collapse/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45615237)

Electric cars are losing value faster than regular gas cars, and this is a big problem for car owners and companies. The article says the problem became clear when BluSmart, an electric taxi company in India, went out of business. After that, many of their used electric cars were sold very cheap, dropping from $12,000 to $3,000 each.

In the U.S., a Tesla Model Y lost 42% of its value in just two years, but a gas-powered Ford truck lost only 20%. Older electric cars lose value even faster than new ones. The main reason is that people are not sure how long electric car batteries will last, and the battery is the most expensive part. Gas cars are easier to price because we know how long their engines and other parts usually last.

Studies from the U.K. and the U.S. show that electric cars can lose more than half of their value in just 3 to 5 years, while gas cars lose less. This is very hard for companies that use many cars, like Hertz, which lost almost $3 billion after buying a lot of Teslas. They had to sell many of these cars for much less than they paid. Fleet owners care a lot about how much they can sell their cars for, and if prices fall too fast, it can ruin their business plans.

Tesla's cars still keep their value better than most other electric cars, especially compared to new Chinese brands like BYD or Nio. Where you live also matters: in places like China and Norway, people like electric cars more, so prices stay higher. In North America, big distances, weather, and few charging stations make used electric cars less attractive.

Some companies and buyers are scared to buy used electric cars because they worry about battery problems and warranties. For families, losing car value is just annoying, but for companies, it can destroy their business. Some new ideas, like renting batteries instead of owning them, might help make values more stable.

More people are now tracking battery health with new data and reports. This is making some buyers feel safer about used electric cars. Research also shows that new batteries last longer than people thought, which could help prices in the future. Car companies now focus more on making cars last longer instead of changing models every year.

Commenters on Hacker News had many opinions. Some said battery worries are real because replacing one is expensive. Others pointed out that gas cars also have big repair costs, and that electric car prices fall mostly because new models get cheaper fast. A few people said that as more people trust used car batteries, prices will get better.

Some users argued that electric cars are still too expensive for most people and that only early adopters buy them now. Others felt that better charging networks and government support in places like Europe help keep prices higher there. There were debates about whether electric cars are really greener, since making and scrapping batteries has its own costs.

Several commenters thought that car makers dropping prices for new EVs is hurting used car values. Others said that big companies like Hertz made bad bets by buying so many electric cars so quickly. Some users were hopeful that new ways to check battery health and better warranties would help the market. A few reminded others that technology is always changing, and this kind of price drop happened before with other products. Overall, people agreed that the used electric car market is confusing right now, but it could get better as batteries improve and more data becomes available.
