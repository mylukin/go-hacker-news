## No Graphics API

This article is about graphics APIs, which are the rules and tools that let programmers control how computers draw pictures on the screen. The author, Sebastian Aaltonen, has worked with graphics for many years and explains why our current graphics APIs are complex and could be much simpler.

He starts by talking about the history of graphics APIs. Ten years ago, new low-level APIs like DirectX 12, Vulkan, and Metal gave developers more control and better performance, but also made everything more complicated. Old APIs, like DirectX 11 and OpenGL, handled a lot of things for you, but the new ones require programmers to manage more details themselves. This led to new layers of code and more specialized roles for programmers.

The author says that today’s hardware is much more advanced and flexible than before. Modern GPUs (the chips that draw graphics) have better memory and can work with data in new ways. Many of the old reasons for complex APIs—like special hardware paths, or the need to pre-bundle settings—aren’t needed anymore. Instead, a simpler API, closer to what CUDA (used for AI) does, would be better and easier to use.

He explains that a modern API could let you use normal C/C++ pointers to GPU memory, making it easy to share data between the CPU and GPU. You could allocate memory with a simple function, write directly to GPU memory, and use easy copy commands for special cases, like textures. Modern GPUs can handle most data as raw memory, so you don’t need many special data formats or binding tricks.

For textures, the article suggests a system where all textures are in a big array, and you access them by index, removing the need for complex binding APIs. He also says shader code (the programs that run on GPUs to draw graphics) could be much simpler, using normal pointers and structs, like in regular C code. This would get rid of many of the headaches developers face today.

Barriers—commands that make sure data is ready before being used—are another pain point in current APIs. The author explains that modern hardware doesn’t need most of the complex tracking that APIs require now. A simpler system with just a few flags would be enough.

He also talks about command buffers (lists of things for the GPU to do). The old idea was to reuse these buffers, but in practice, games change too much for that to work. Modern engines just make new ones each frame, and APIs should support that.

For drawing 3D objects, the article says that most of the current setup—like defining all the ways data is passed to shaders—could be replaced with just passing pointers to structs. This would make the code much shorter and easier to understand, without losing performance.

In the comments, many people agree that graphics APIs have become too complex and hard to use. Some say they miss the simplicity of older APIs, even if they were slower. Others like the control that new APIs give, but wish they were easier to learn and debug. A few are worried that making things too simple could hide important details and make it hard to optimize for special cases.

One commenter points out that the proposed changes would help game developers a lot, but might make things harder for people building general-purpose tools or targeting many different devices. Another notes that different GPU vendors have their own preferences, and it might be hard to get everyone to agree on a new, simpler API.

Some people discuss how this new approach could break old software, or require big changes to existing engines. Others are excited about the idea and think it could lead to better performance and easier development. A few mention that similar ideas are already being used in some AI and compute workloads, and it’s time for graphics APIs to catch up.

Several commenters say that the biggest problem today is the huge number of small details and special cases developers have to remember. They like the author’s idea of treating everything as memory and just passing pointers. Some worry that making the API too low-level could create new types of bugs, but most agree that the current situation is harder than it needs to be. Many hope that GPU vendors and API designers will listen to these suggestions and create a simpler, more modern graphics API soon.

## Prediction: AI will make formal verification go mainstream

- 原文链接: [Prediction: AI will make formal verification go mainstream](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2025/12/08/ai-formal-verification.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46294574)

This article says that AI will help make formal verification—a way to prove software is correct—common in software development. The author explains that formal verification uses special tools and languages to make sure code works as intended, even for strange or rare cases.

Today, only a few experts use formal verification because it is very hard and takes a lot of time. For example, proving a small operating system correct needed twenty person-years and many lines of complex proof code. Most normal software teams don’t use these methods because they are too expensive and slow, and only a few people in the world know how to do them.

The main reason is cost: fixing bugs is usually cheaper than using formal proofs. Also, bugs usually hurt users more than developers, so there’s little push for these expensive methods. But now, AI coding assistants can write not just code, but also proof scripts for formal verification tools. These AIs still need human experts for now, but the author thinks soon they could do most of the work alone.

If AI can make formal verification much cheaper, more teams can use it. Also, as AI generates more code, we will want to prove that code is correct instead of just checking it by hand. Proof checkers help here: they only accept correct proofs, and if the AI makes a mistake, the checker will reject it and ask the AI to try again.

But even with better tools, we still need to write good specifications—clear rules about what the code should do. This might still be hard, but it should be easier than writing all proofs by hand. AI might even help translate between normal language and formal specs, though there’s some risk of confusion.

The author believes that soon, developers might just describe what they want, and the AI will create both the code and a proof that it works, making software development very different. People might stop checking every line of code, just like we don’t check machine code from a compiler.

In the comments, some readers are excited and agree that AI could make formal verification much easier and more common. Others are more careful, saying that writing good specifications is still a very hard problem, and AI may not solve that soon. Some point out that even proof checkers can have bugs, so nothing is ever perfect.

A few people share experiences with formal verification tools, saying they are still hard to use and require a lot of training. Some think big companies or safety-critical fields will adopt this first, but most normal software might take longer. Others worry that if developers trust AI proofs too much, mistakes in the specs or checkers could lead to new problems.

Some commenters like the idea that AI can keep trying proofs until it gets them right, but note this can take a lot of computer power. There are also questions about how well AI can understand what humans really want from the code, especially for complex systems.

Finally, some people argue that the biggest challenge may be changing how developers think about software, since most teams are not used to writing formal specs or using proofs at all. Still, most agree that if AI makes formal verification much easier, it could become a normal part of building software in the future.

## GPT Image 1.5

- 原文链接: [GPT Image 1.5](https://openai.com/index/new-chatgpt-images-is-here/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46291941)

OpenAI has launched a new version of ChatGPT Images, powered by their latest image generation model called GPT Image 1.5. This tool lets users create and edit images faster and with more control, whether they are making small tweaks or big changes.

The new model can do things like add, remove, or change parts of images while keeping important details the same. For example, it can keep the lighting and the look of people’s faces steady between edits. It also handles creative tasks better, like making movie posters or adding text and new styles to pictures. The model is improved at following detailed instructions, so you get what you ask for more often. Text in the images now looks sharper and works with smaller or denser writing.

ChatGPT Images now has a special place in the app and website, making it easier to try out ideas quickly. You can use preset styles and trending prompts, and you can upload your photo once to use your face in many images. Images are made up to four times faster, and you can work on new images while others are still being created.

The API for developers is now cheaper and better at keeping logos and other key details the same across many edits. This is useful for jobs like making product images for online shops or creating marketing graphics. Companies like Wix and Figma are already using this model for their own needs.

OpenAI says the new model is much improved, but it is not perfect yet. There are still some limits, such as with many faces or with working in different languages. The old version of ChatGPT Images will still be around as a custom tool.

On Hacker News, some users are excited about the faster speed and better editing. They say it is helpful for design, marketing, or just for fun. Others are impressed by the model’s ability to follow instructions closely, especially for complex edits or when working with text. A few people mention that being able to keep the same style or face across edits is a big step for creative work.

Some users worry about possible mistakes, like images with too many faces or errors with foreign languages. Others talk about the impact on jobs, with one person saying this makes it even easier to create ads and product images, maybe reducing the need for some human designers. A few are concerned about copyright, especially for logos and branded content.

There are also questions about how OpenAI will handle misuse or bad actors creating fake or harmful images. Some are happy about the lower price for the API, saying it will help small businesses and indie hackers try more ideas. Others point out that while the tool is powerful, real creativity and careful checking are still needed. Overall, the community finds the update exciting but asks for more details about safety and future plans.

## 40 percent of fMRI signals do not correspond to actual brain activity

- 原文链接: [40 percent of fMRI signals do not correspond to actual brain activity](https://www.tum.de/en/news-and-events/all-news/press-releases/details/40-percent-of-mri-signals-do-not-correspond-to-actual-brain-activity)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46288415)

This article says that for about 30 years, fMRI scans have been used to study brain activity, but new research shows that almost 40% of the signals from these scans do not actually match real brain activity. The study found that the usual idea—more brain activity means more blood flow and more oxygen in that area—is not always true. In some cases, the fMRI signal goes up when real brain activity goes down, and sometimes, active brain areas do not show the expected increase in blood flow.

The researchers tested this by giving people tasks like mental math or remembering things from their own lives. While people did these tasks, the team measured both the fMRI signal and the real oxygen use in different brain areas. They found that, often, when a part of the brain worked harder and needed more oxygen, it just used oxygen more efficiently instead of getting more blood flow. This means the standard way of reading fMRI results—thinking that more signal means more brain activity—can be wrong.

This is important for brain science, especially in studies about diseases like depression or Alzheimer’s. Many past studies used blood flow as a sign of brain activity, but this new research says those results might be wrong, especially in people with blood vessel problems. The researchers suggest that future studies should use more direct ways to measure oxygen use, not just blood flow, for a better picture of what is happening in the brain.

In the Hacker News comments, some users say this is not really new; scientists have known that fMRI is not a perfect tool for a long time. Others add that the BOLD signal in fMRI is only an indirect sign of brain activity and depends on many things, like blood flow and how cells use oxygen. A few people worry that many past studies could be wrong or need to be redone, which could slow down brain research. Some users suggest that this might push more people to use new methods or improve fMRI, while others think it will take time for the field to change. There are also comments about how science is always updating itself as we learn more, and that this is a normal part of research. Finally, a few users point out that even if fMRI is not perfect, it can still be useful if we understand its limits and use it carefully.

## Writing a blatant Telegram clone using Qt, QML and Rust. And C++

- 原文链接: [Writing a blatant Telegram clone using Qt, QML and Rust. And C++](https://kemble.net/blog/provoke/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46289918)

This article is about someone trying to make a copy of Telegram using Qt, QML, Rust, and some C++. The author wanted to play with QML again and use Rust for most of the code, mixing in C++ only where needed.

The author explains they love QML for making nice user interfaces quickly. They also like Rust, especially for its safety compared to C++. They wanted to make a “native” app, not just another web app, and chose Telegram as inspiration because its desktop UI feels great. They looked at other chat clients, especially Matrix ones, but none felt as smooth as Telegram. For building the app, they tried two main Rust-Qt bridges: cxx-qt and qmetaobject-rs. cxx-qt gave full access to Qt but was slow to build and had annoying code generation steps, especially with VS Code. qmetaobject-rs was simpler and faster, and let them get QML running quickly, but didn’t give access to every Qt feature.

To make the development faster, the author hacked together a basic hot reload system. When a QML file changes, the app restarts and loads the new UI. Next, they started copying Telegram’s UI, such as the sidebar and chat splitter. The built-in QML splitter was missing features, so they made their own, though it had some rough edges. The author enjoyed making animations and UI details, like chat bubbles and emoji popups, with QML. They also added system tray support and found a clever way to update the tray icon with message counts using QML’s image features.

When they needed features not exposed in Rust or QML, like changing the mouse cursor, they wrote small C++ modules. They used CMake to build the C++ code and called its functions from Rust using extern "C". The author says they plan to use Rust for the app’s logic, with C++ only for gaps in Qt access.

The project, called “Provoke,” is open source and available on GitHub. The author isn’t sure if they’ll keep working on it, but they had fun learning and experimenting.

Commenters on Hacker News had different views. Some praised the write-up and the author’s playful tone, saying it was fun to read and inspiring for learning about Qt and Rust together. Others pointed out that building cross-language apps is often more trouble than it looks, especially for long-term maintenance. A few people were surprised at how far the author got just using QML and Rust. Some shared their own struggles with QML, such as poor documentation or tricky build tools, while others said QML is still the best way to build beautiful desktop UIs quickly.

Several comments discussed the choice between cxx-qt and qmetaobject-rs, with some preferring the simplicity of qmetaobject-rs and others wanting full Qt features from cxx-qt despite slower builds. One developer warned that mixing Rust, QML, and C++ can make debugging harder. A few were interested in the hot reload hack, saying it’s a clever solution for fast UI changes. Some users doubted the long-term usefulness, saying that Matrix and Telegram are big projects and copying them is hard. Overall, the thread had a friendly tone, with many people saying they might try QML or Rust for their own projects after reading this.

## The World Happiness Report is beset with methodological problems

- 原文链接: [The World Happiness Report is beset with methodological problems](https://yaschamounk.substack.com/p/the-world-happiness-report-is-a-sham)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46282874)

The article looks at the World Happiness Report, which often makes news by saying that places like Finland and Denmark are the happiest countries in the world. The author argues that this report has big problems with how it measures happiness, calling it misleading and even a “sham.”

The main point is that the report is based almost only on one question, called the Cantril Ladder. This question asks people to rate their life on a scale from 0 to 10, but it doesn’t really ask about happiness itself. Instead, people might think about money, social status, or success when answering. Studies show that the way the ladder question is written makes people focus more on wealth or power, not on how happy they feel day to day. 

The article also points out that the countries that rank highest on the report, like Finland and Sweden, actually have high rates of depression and suicide. This does not fit with the idea that these are the happiest places. The author mentions research by economists Blanchflower and Bryson, who used more questions about emotions—like whether people smiled, felt sad, or worried—to measure happiness. With this method, the rankings change a lot. Finland falls far down the list, and countries like Japan and Panama look much happier. 

Inside the United States, some states such as Hawaii and Minnesota score higher than Finland when measured by these broader questions. The author warns that the media and big groups like the UN should be more careful and honest when they talk about these happiness rankings. He thinks that chasing new ways to measure happiness, while ignoring real problems with the data, can do more harm than good.

In the Hacker News comments, some people agree with the author, saying that measuring happiness is very hard and that culture plays a big role in how people answer surveys. Others point out that even though Scandinavians don’t smile much in public, they might still feel secure and satisfied with life, which is not the same as being joyful all the time. A few users think that the Cantril Ladder is still useful—it gives a simple, easy-to-compare number, even if it’s not perfect.

Several commenters say that no happiness ranking will ever be fully accurate, since happiness means different things to different cultures. Some users warn against making big decisions based only on such reports. Others wish the media would explain the limits of the data more clearly, instead of just repeating the rankings every year. A few people share personal stories about living in high-ranking countries and feeling less happy than expected. Some also note that economic stability and safety, common in Scandinavia, may be more important than moment-to-moment joy for most people. Overall, there is wide agreement that both the question and the way the results are shared deserve more skepticism.

## Thin desires are eating life

- 原文链接: [Thin desires are eating life](https://www.joanwestenberg.com/thin-desires-are-eating-your-life/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46283276)

This article talks about the difference between “thick” and “thin” desires in modern life. The writer says many people feel hungry for something, but they do not know what it is, even when they have more than enough.

A “thick desire” is something that changes you when you work toward it, like learning a skill or building a deep friendship. A “thin desire” gives you a quick feeling of reward but does not change you, like checking your phone for notifications or scrolling through social media. The author explains that many tech companies now make money by giving us the rewards of thick desires without any real effort or change. For example, social media gives a feeling of connection without true friendship, and productivity apps make you feel busy even if nothing important is done.

The problem is that thin desires are everywhere and easy to get, while thick desires take time, effort, and patience. Over time, the places and ways people used to find thick desires—like clubs, workshops, or face-to-face time with others—have disappeared, replaced by things that are quick, easy, and lonely. The author suggests small ways to bring thick desires back: bake bread, write letters, or build software just for one friend. These things are slow, cannot be made faster, and will not make you famous or rich. But doing them can help you feel more whole and less empty, even if it does not change the world.

In the Hacker News comments, some people agree strongly with the author. They say they also feel empty after too much time online and miss slow, deep activities like hobbies or building things with their hands. Others say it is hard to avoid thin desires because tech is made to be addictive and most people are busy. Some readers point out that not everyone has time or money for slow hobbies, so it is not a simple solution for all. There are also comments about how society and jobs push people toward thin desires, since big companies want things to scale and be fast.

A few people worry that the article is just nostalgia for the past and that new tech can also help people grow, if used well. Some share stories about how learning hard things online or meeting friends on the internet led to real change in their lives. Others think that both thick and thin desires have a place, and that balance is important. One comment says the real problem is not tech or thin desires, but how people use them. Another suggests that people could try to make tech more supportive of thick desires, not just quick rewards.

Overall, many readers see the problem, but they have different ideas about what to do and if things can really change.

## Japan to revise romanization rules for first time in 70 years

- 原文链接: [Japan to revise romanization rules for first time in 70 years](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2025/08/21/japan/panel-hepburn-style-romanization/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46286292)

Japan is planning to change the rules for writing Japanese words with the Latin alphabet, called romanization, for the first time in 70 years. The goal is to make it easier for people to read and use Japanese words written in English letters.

The article explains that Japan uses more than one system for romanization, but the most common is called Hepburn. This system tries to show Japanese sounds in a way that English speakers can understand. For example, the city 東京 is written as "Tokyo." However, some Japanese sounds do not match English sounds well, so it can be confusing. The government wants to update the rules to help with things like passports, place names, and learning materials. They also want to make it easier for people using computers and phones to search and type Japanese words. The article says that the old rules were made a long time ago, and language has changed since then. New technology, like the internet, also means that clear romanization is more important than before. The plan is to talk to experts and decide on new rules soon.

In the comments, some people like the idea of updating the rules, saying it will help travelers and students. Others worry that changing the system will make things more confusing, especially for people who already learned the old way. A few commenters point out that no romanization system is perfect, and each has problems. Some people say Japanese should just be written in Japanese characters, not Latin letters. There are also comments about how different countries handle their own languages and alphabets. A few developers talk about how romanization affects software and search engines. Some users share funny or strange examples of Japanese words that look odd when written in English letters. Others hope the changes will make it easier for everyone, but they know it will take time for people to get used to new rules.
