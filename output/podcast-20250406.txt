Hello! Welcome to Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today is 2025-04-06. Today we will talk about a few interesting topics from the tech world.

First, let's talk about Standard Ebooks. This is a group that makes free digital books. These books are from the public domain, which means they are free to use. Standard Ebooks takes texts from places like Project Gutenberg, fixes mistakes, and makes them look nice. They use modern technology so the books are easy to read on devices.

Next, we have news about Apple's Darwin OS and its XNU Kernel. Darwin is the base for macOS and iOS. XNU is a part that connects software and hardware. People discuss how Apple made good choices by using Darwin instead of Linux. They also talk about Apple's strong security features, like code signing and sandboxing, which keep systems safe.

Now let's look at a system called MCP, which connects AI models with tools and data. MCP is not secure, and there are many risks. Attackers can make the system run bad commands, and tools can become harmful without warning. People agree that MCP needs better security checks. They have different ideas on how to make it safer.

We also have a story about the order of files in a folder on a computer. This folder sets rules for SSH, a way to connect to computers securely. The order of files is important because the first setting takes effect. People talk about how this can be confusing. They share tips to make sure settings work correctly.

Let's move to "ADHD body doubling." This tool helps people with ADHD focus by having another person nearby. This person, called a "body double," just needs to be present. People have mixed feelings about this tool. Some find it helpful, while others prefer to work alone.

Now, we have SeedLM, a new way to make large language models smaller and faster. It uses a special method to reduce the memory needed. This helps run models without losing accuracy. People think it's a good step for making AI faster on devices like phones.

We also have a story about blacksmithing and Lisp, a programming language. It compares how blacksmiths shape metal to how programmers customize Lisp. People have different opinions on Lisp's usefulness and why it is not as popular as other languages today.

Lastly, let's talk about QVQ-Max, a new AI model that can see and understand images and videos. It helps solve problems by using visual reasoning. People are excited about its uses in work, school, and daily life.
