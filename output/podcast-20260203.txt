Hello everyone, this is the 2026-02-03 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we bring you the latest stories and discussions from the world of software and technology.

First, let’s talk about Qwen3-Coder-Next, a new open-source AI model for writing computer code from the Qwen team. This model is made to help people write and understand code in many languages, like Python, JavaScript, and C++. The team says Qwen3-Coder-Next beats models like GPT-4 on some programming tasks. It can read code, fix mistakes, explain code, and works well with common developer tools such as code editors. The model is open-source and free to use, and the team is focused on safety—trying to avoid writing harmful code or leaking private data. They also share real test results and examples where the model solves real coding problems, showing it can handle both short commands and long, complex requests. Qwen3-Coder-Next is designed for both beginners and experts, and the team invites feedback to keep improving it.

In the comments, many people are excited about another open-source coding model. Some think it will help small teams and indie hackers who cannot pay for big commercial tools, while others compare it to GPT-4 and Code Llama. A few worry about the model’s size and if it can run well on normal computers. There are questions about safety, and if the tool can be tricked into making dangerous code. Developers like the support for many languages and hope the team will share more about how it was trained. Some point out bugs in the demo, saying it is good for simple tasks but less strong for very complex problems. There is also interest in using Qwen3-Coder-Next in education to help students learn programming. Overall, the community is interested and hopeful, but wants to see more real-world results.

Next, we look at Deno Sandbox, a new service from Deno for running untrusted code safely in the cloud using Linux microVMs. It is built for platforms that need to run code created by users or AI, and helps keep dangerous code away from your main systems. You can start and manage sandboxes with JavaScript or Python SDKs, and control them with SSH, HTTP, or VS Code. One key feature is that secrets like API keys are never put directly into the sandbox. Instead, the real secret only appears if the code connects to an approved API host. This helps stop bad code from stealing secrets. There is also strong network control, so you can choose which sites the sandbox can reach, with requests to unapproved sites blocked by an outbound proxy. Sandboxes can be deployed to Deno Deploy with a single command, and you can save data or states with volumes and snapshots. The sandboxes boot in less than a second, have 2 vCPUs, up to 4 GB memory, and last up to 30 minutes. Pricing is by compute time and storage, with some free usage.

On Hacker News, many like the idea of running untrusted code in a strong sandbox, especially as AI-generated code becomes more common. The approach to protecting secrets is praised, solving a real problem with plugins and user scripts. Some ask about performance, pricing, and how Deno Sandbox compares to Firecracker or Google Cloud Run. A few worry about lock-in, since deploying is easiest with Deno, but harder with other tools. Some say it is great for short, safe runs, but might not fit all use cases, especially if you need more time or storage. There are questions about security, like whether the proxy can be bypassed, and if side-channels could leak data. Some want support for more languages, and others are excited to try it for AI agents and plugins. Overall, the community is interested and optimistic, but careful about pricing, security, and long-term support.

Moving on, let’s talk about AliSQL, which is a fork of MySQL made by Alibaba, now open source. AliSQL adds new features like a vector engine and support for DuckDB as a storage engine. It is based on MySQL 8.0.44 but has many changes to help big companies handle large data and special workloads. One main feature is using DuckDB inside MySQL, which lets you run fast analytical queries without leaving MySQL. Another is vector storage and search, allowing you to store high-dimension vectors and search them quickly with the HNSW algorithm, which is useful for AI and search tasks. This means you can build things like recommendation systems or semantic search with standard SQL. More improvements are planned, like faster schema changes and better replication. Building AliSQL is similar to building MySQL, and the license is GPL-2.0.

In the comments, some people are excited to see vector search inside a SQL database, saying it helps connect AI and normal data work. Others wonder how well DuckDB integration will work, since DuckDB is usually used alone. Some ask about performance for real business use, and others note that AliSQL is not the first MySQL fork, but may be the first to focus on AI features. There are concerns about long-term support, and some want better English documentation. People compare AliSQL to MariaDB or Percona, thinking about which is best for them. Some say using DuckDB under MySQL could make debugging harder, but also adds power. Overall, people seem interested but want to see more real-world tests.

Next, we have FlashAttention-T, a new way to make the attention part of AI models faster and better. Attention is key in models like ChatGPT but uses a lot of memory and time. FlashAttention-T uses "tensorized attention," which changes how the computer does the math so it can do more work at once. It uses the GPU in a smarter way, letting it work with bigger pieces of data and keep more in fast memory. This saves time and memory, making training faster and cheaper. The paper shows that models using FlashAttention-T train faster and use less memory, and the method works with many types of models. It also does not limit what you can build, and can be used with other new AI tricks. Numbers in the paper show it is much faster than normal attention, especially for long text.

In the comments, people are excited about the speed improvements, saying faster attention is important for building bigger AI models. Some ask how hard it is to use FlashAttention-T in real projects, and if it works with popular AI libraries. Others want to know if it helps small models too. Some like the technical details and compare it to other attention methods, asking which is best. One person notes that even faster models are still expensive to train, and wonders if these improvements will make AI cheaper for everyone. There is interest in the open-source code and in trying it out. Overall, comments show excitement and some questions about real-world use.

Now, let’s talk about Agent Skills, which are folders of instructions and resources to help AI agents do their jobs better. AI agents are smart, but often do not know enough about specific jobs or company rules. Agent Skills give them clear guides and context, which they can load when needed. This makes agents more reliable and accurate. A skill can be made once and used by many agents that support the standard. For teams, Agent Skills let you save company know-how in shared packages that are easy to update. With Agent Skills, you can give agents special knowledge for tasks like legal reviews or data analysis, or add new powers like making presentations. The format is open, started by Anthropic, and many AI tools already support it.

On Hacker News, some people think Agent Skills are a smart way to share knowledge and make AI agents more useful. Others say it is like old ideas, such as plugins or macros, but for AI. Some worry that skills might not always work if the agent does not understand enough context. There are questions about how easy it is to write a good skill, and if most companies will have time to make them. Some like the open standard and sharing across tools, while others worry about security and privacy. Some hope Agent Skills will help agents handle more real-world tasks, but others doubt agents are reliable enough yet. The discussion is mixed but interested, with people wanting to see how the idea develops.

Next, Apple has released Xcode 26.3, adding “agentic coding” to help developers build apps faster and smarter. Developers can now use AI agents like Claude Agent and Codex right inside Xcode for complex coding tasks. The agents can break down projects, make coding decisions, search docs, explore files, change settings, and even run builds and fixes, all with little help from the user. They can also check results with Xcode Previews. With the new Model Context Protocol, developers can add any compatible agent, not just the built-in ones. The update is first available as a release candidate for Apple Developer Program members.

On Hacker News, some are excited, saying this could save time and let them focus on important parts of coding. Others worry too much automation might hide what’s going on, making it hard to debug code later. Some think big AI models in Xcode might slow things down or need more computer power. There are privacy concerns—will agents send code to the cloud? Some ask how well these agents know Apple’s libraries and best practices, and if letting agents make decisions could lead to mistakes. Some like the open protocol, while others worry new developers might not learn the basics if AI does everything. People want to see real-world results before trusting these features. Some think this is Apple keeping up with others, while some see it as a big step forward.

Next, there’s an article explaining why you sometimes see lots of equals signs in old emails online. The reason is technical: it comes from “quoted-printable” encoding, which was used to send longer lines and special characters in old emails. If a line is too long, an equals sign is added at the end to show it continues, and special characters are also encoded with equals signs. Problems happen when line endings are changed from Windows to Unix but the software does not update, so the decoder gets confused and leaves equals signs or removes the wrong letters. This is a common technical issue with email formats.

In the comments, people enjoyed the jokes in the article. Some shared stories and jokes about email, while others guessed the equals signs were from scanning errors or secret codes, but the article explains it’s just about encoding. Some linked to the article on Reddit, and most agreed it is a technical detail, not a secret code.

Finally, we have a story about OpenClaw, also called Moltbot, a bot that is running on many computers and servers. OpenClaw crawls websites and collects data, but does not respect robots.txt, using up server resources and sometimes breaking websites. It keeps changing to get around blocks and does not tell site owners what it is collecting or who is running it. The article warns that OpenClaw could cause more damage if it keeps spreading.

In the comments, many agree OpenClaw is a problem. Some have seen their own sites hit by it and spent time or money to block it. Others say bots like OpenClaw are not new, and website owners should use firewalls or CAPTCHAs. People note that good bots follow rules and identify themselves, while bad ones like OpenClaw try to hide. Some worry too many bad bots will lead sites to block all bots, even good ones. There are calls for new rules or laws for bots, but others say the problem is hard to fix. Overall, people agree OpenClaw is making the web worse for everyone.
