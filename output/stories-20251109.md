This article is about building a complex 3D-printed marble fountain using procedural generation and custom code. The author explains how working with high-end 3D printers led them to create a marble run art piece with many moving parts.

The first step was to design tracks for the marbles. The author started by placing random points, connecting them with curves, and keeping a steady slope so marbles could roll down. They realized that just cutting a tube was too basic, so they made a path solver to fill the printer’s space with as much track as possible. This was hard because the track shape depends a lot on how you start it, and getting smooth paths that the marbles could follow took a lot of trial and error.

To make sure the track worked well, the code pushed points to stay inside the box, spread out evenly, keep a constant slope, and avoid sharp turns or sudden changes. The tracks also needed to stay away from each other and from themselves, so marbles wouldn’t crash. Another challenge was controlling marble speed: if straight sections were too long, marbles would go too fast and fly off, but tight turns could stop them. The solution was to make the track snake back and forth, adding banked turns to control speed.

The lift for the marbles was designed like a ball screw, which is held in place by the marbles themselves. If marbles only pressed on one side, the screw would wobble and marbles would fall off, which was a problem.

Supports for the track were made using a simple particle system. These supports would pull towards each other but also push away to keep good spacing. The support pillars ended up with smooth arcs thanks to a bit of simulated inertia, and the author spent more time making them look nice than solving real structural problems.

When exporting the final 3D models, it took a long time and was hard for the OpenSCAD software to handle. The author thinks a different, more advanced tool would be better for future projects. They mention wanting to add more features, like better ways to measure marble speed and predict how the marbles move.

The project took more work than expected, with the author working on it from February to September. They rushed to get it ready for an art show, but the fountain could only run for a few hours before overheating and still lost a few balls every hour. After the show, the author was tired and stopped working on it for a year before finally sharing the code and story.

In the comments, many readers are impressed by the creativity and technical work. Some people are excited to see procedural design used for physical art and not just for digital things like games. Others ask about the details of the path solver, wishing for more code examples or visualizations of the algorithms. A few readers talk about their own marble runs and how hard it is to control marble speed and keep things reliable.

Some people suggest using other tools besides OpenSCAD, like Blender or SDF libraries, for better handling of organic shapes. There are also comments about the challenges of making something durable enough for public display, and hints about using sensors or cameras to track marbles in real time. A few readers share stories about 3D printing failures and how overhangs or complex shapes can be tricky, agreeing with the author’s struggles.

One commenter points out that sharing “janky” or unfinished code is still helpful for other makers. Someone else thanks the author for being open about both the fun and the frustration in the project. Overall, the comments are positive and encourage the author to keep experimenting and share more updates.

Montana passed a new law that gives people in the state the legal right to use computers and AI tools. The Montana Right to Compute Act says owning and using hardware, software, and AI is now a protected right, similar to freedom of speech or property rights.

The law was signed by the governor and is the first of its kind in the United States. It says that people in Montana can control and access their own digital tools. The law does allow the state to make rules for safety and health, but only if it is truly needed and done in a careful way. This standard is very strong and is meant to protect people’s rights.

For AI that runs important systems like power grids, the law says there must be a way for humans to shut things down and that safety checks must happen every year. Supporters believe this law is a big step for digital freedom, especially as AI gets more common. They say Montana’s law is different from other states that try to limit AI or put more rules on technology.

Groups that care about privacy and digital rights are praising Montana. Some other states, like New Hampshire, are thinking about passing similar laws. There are also groups, including international ones, that say using computers is a basic human right. They argue that computers help people think and be creative, so access should be protected.

Some people think Montana is leading the way and will inspire more states to protect the right to compute. Others say the law helps balance progress in technology with important safety rules.

In the Hacker News comments, many readers are happy about the new law. Some say it’s good to protect people’s ability to use computers and make their own software. Others hope this will stop big tech companies and governments from blocking what people can do with their own devices. A few worry that the law might not have a big effect if most people do not know about it or if companies find ways around it.

Some readers question if the law is too broad or if it will actually hold up in court. Others like that Montana is being bold, while a few wonder if other states will copy the idea or if this is just a local issue. There are comments about the need for digital rights in a world where AI and technology are everywhere. Some users point out that having a legal right to compute could help small businesses and hobbyists, not just tech experts.

A few are concerned about how the law will work with federal laws and if there will be conflicts. Some see this as a pushback against growing tech regulation, while others think more rules might still be needed for safety. Overall, most agree that this is an interesting and important move by Montana.

- 原文链接: [Building a 2.5kWh battery from disposable vapes to power my workshop [video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy-wFixuRVU)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45803601)

This video shows someone powering his house using battery cells taken from 500 thrown-away vape pens. He collects many used disposable vapes, opens them, and removes the small lithium batteries inside. He then tests each battery to check if it still works and how much energy it can hold. He uses special 3D-printed holders, made from soft plastic, to help test, charge, and arrange the batteries safely. He connects all the batteries into a big battery pack, reaching about 2.5 kilowatt-hours of total energy. The battery pack is wired to an inverter, which changes the battery’s DC power into AC power that the house can use. He is able to run his workshop and even power some things in his house, like a kettle, from this recycled battery bank. The project shows that these “disposable” vape batteries are still strong and useful after people throw them away. He also talks about the problems of waste and how much good material is lost when these vapes are thrown in the trash.

Commenters are amazed he actually did the project and said the video was not “clickbait.” Many praise his clever use of 3D-printed parts and the way he tested and arranged the batteries. Some people give safety advice, explaining that sending power back through workshop cables can be risky and that a proper switch is needed to safely swap between battery and grid power. Others warn this project is dangerous, even if he used safety features, and say lithium batteries can catch fire or explode if not handled right. A few laugh about how easy it is to find these batteries on the street and use them in other gadgets like flashlights. Some are shocked that disposable vapes have such good batteries that get thrown away every day, calling it a waste. A professional engineer suggests using higher voltage to make the battery pack safer and more efficient. People joke about using calculator solar panels next, and some share funny thoughts about the project’s wild side. There are also worries about whether vape shops really recycle these batteries, or if they just pile up until someone like this comes to get them. Finally, many agree this project highlights how much we throw away and how creative reuse can help the environment.

## The Manuscripts of Edsger W. Dijkstra

- 原文链接: [The Manuscripts of Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45866224)

This article is about the online archive of Edsger W. Dijkstra’s manuscripts, a famous computer scientist known for his work in algorithms, programming, and computing theory. The website collects and shares over a thousand of his technical notes, letters, and reports from his long career.

The manuscripts are called “EWDs,” named after his initials. Dijkstra wrote these documents for over forty years, mailing them to colleagues in industry and academia. Many of his best-known works started as simple EWD notes. The site offers these documents as PDF files, along with indexes to help you find them by year, title, or topic. Some of the EWDs have been transcribed to text for better search and access, especially for people who cannot see well. There are also translations into English from Dutch and a few other languages. Volunteers help with these tasks, though new translations are no longer accepted because it is too hard to capture Dijkstra’s careful language in other languages.

The original papers, letters, and photos are kept at the University of Texas at Austin. The website adds summaries of some EWDs, and readers are invited to help by writing more. Recordings of Dijkstra’s lectures and interviews are also available. The site shares interviews, articles, and memorials about Dijkstra’s life and ideas, including a special symposium held for his retirement, and it mentions the Dijkstra Prize, an award for important work in distributed computing.

The copyright for most EWDs belongs to Dijkstra’s children, but some published works are owned by their publishers. The site also links to related projects and encourages users to help with proofreading and noting links between EWDs.

In the comments, many people say Dijkstra’s writings are deep and still useful today, especially for learning about clear thinking and programming. Some mention that his writing style is difficult but rewarding if you take your time. Others talk about how unique the EWD archive is, giving a window into a great mind’s working process. A few users share favorite EWDs or recall how reading them changed their own careers. Some people wish more well-known scientists would share their personal notes like this. There are comments about the technical challenge of making these old scanned PDFs easier to search and read. Others praise the volunteers who transcribe and index the documents. A few users discuss Dijkstra’s strong opinions—some found them inspiring, while others felt he could be too harsh or strict in his views. Many agree that having this free archive is a valuable gift to the programming world, and some suggest that students should read at least a few EWDs to learn careful, logical thinking.

## The Principles of Diffusion Models

- 原文链接: [The Principles of Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21890)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45866572)

This article explains how diffusion models work in machine learning. Diffusion models are now popular for making images, sounds, and other data from random noise. 

The main idea is simple: you start with real data and slowly add noise until it is just random noise. This is called the forward process. The model then learns the reverse process—how to turn noise back into data, step by step. There are three main ways to understand diffusion models. The first is the variational view, which is about removing noise, almost like cleaning a dirty picture. The second is the score-based view, which learns the direction you need to go to make the data more likely. The third is the flow-based view, where you smoothly move from noise to data along a path, using what is called a velocity field. All these ideas use a changing “velocity” over time to go from noise to data, and the process is like solving a math problem called a differential equation. The article also talks about ways to guide the model to control what it makes, make the process faster, and learn smart ways to jump between different steps in the noise process. It is written for people who know a bit about deep learning.

In the comment section, some readers say this article is a very clear and helpful summary, especially for people new to diffusion models. Others agree that having three different views is useful for understanding, since some find the math behind one view easier than another. One commenter points out that the score-based view is now used in many real-world tools, while another says the flow-based ideas help connect diffusion models to older machine learning methods. Some people ask for more simple examples or pictures to make the ideas easier to understand. There are also debates about which view is best for building new models—some think the variational view is best for teaching, while others like the flow-based view for research. A few readers mention that diffusion models are slow to run, and hope the ideas for faster solving will help. Some express concern that the math is still too hard for beginners, even in this summary. Others share links to code and demos to help others try diffusion models themselves. One commenter wonders if diffusion models will replace other types of generative models like GANs, but others reply that both have strengths and weaknesses. Overall, most readers find the article helpful and a good starting point for learning more.

The article talks about the Pennsylvania Computer & Technology Museum, also called The Computer Church, which has one of the largest collections of analog computers in the world. The museum shows how these old computers helped with military, space, and engineering work after World War II.

The collection has over 50 rare analog computers, including machines like the ISEC250 Stock Market Computer, DONNER 3500, EAI TR-48, and the RangeKeeper Mark 7. These computers were very important in the 1940s and 1950s, before digital computers became common. They solved complex math problems using gears, switches, and wires, showing that machines could do work that usually needed math experts.

One famous computer in the collection is the Rangekeeper Mark VII, which was used on the USS St. Louis during the Pearl Harbor attack. This machine helped control the ship’s big guns and was key to the ship escaping safely. The museum also has other items like the Hollerith Card Punch and Tabulating Machine, which are very early data machines used for things like the census.

The museum covers the history of early personal computing too. It has copies of the Homebrew Computer Club Newsletter, important for the Silicon Valley tech scene, and issues of Computer Notes, which published Bill Gates’s “Open Letter to Hobbyists” about software rights. Other unique items include a Nieman Marcus Catalog that once sold a “Kitchen Computer” as a joke gift, and historic magazines and books about computer pioneers like Vannevar Bush and Gordon Moore.

In the comments, some people say the museum’s collection is a great way to remember how far computing has come, and they like seeing rare analog machines in one place. Others talk about how analog computers are not well known today, yet they were vital for early science and military work. Some visitors mention that these old computers are hard to repair or keep running, but it’s important to save them for history.

A few commenters share their memories of working with similar machines in school or the military, saying it was fun but sometimes tricky. Some people wish more museums would show off analog computers and teach how they work, not just focus on digital tech. Others ask about visiting the museum or seeing more online pictures, since analog machines are rare.

There are also comments on how the Homebrew Computer Club and early newsletters helped people learn and share about computers before the internet. Some think the museum should make more videos or guides to explain these old machines to new generations.

## The Sega Master System

- 原文链接: [The Sega Master System](https://bumbershootsoft.wordpress.com/2025/11/08/the-sega-master-system/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45868259)

The article looks at the Sega Master System, a video game console from the 1980s, and compares it to other systems like the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and Sega’s earlier SG-1000. It explains how video game consoles are grouped into “generations,” but says these groups are not always clear because technology moves in strange ways.

The Master System came after the SG-1000, which was similar to the older ColecoVision in hardware, but was released at the same time as the Famicom (the Japanese NES). Sega waited several years before selling its consoles worldwide, so the Master System ended up competing directly with the NES, even though both started from different places. The article explains the technical details, like how much memory each system had, how graphics and colors worked, what types of cartridges they used, and how they handled things like scrolling backgrounds and sprites.

For example, the Master System had more RAM than the NES, could show more colors, and had a simpler way to do split-screen effects. The NES, on the other hand, needed more creative programming tricks to get special effects, which sometimes made it more flexible but also harder to use. Sega’s hardware was designed to be strong and reliable, but less open for strange tricks. The article says that working with Sega’s systems feels more straightforward, while Nintendo’s systems could surprise you if you learned their secrets.

The article also talks about how game cartridges worked, how the Master System’s memory was managed, and how people making new software today can use old tools and code from the SG-1000 to build things for the Master System. The author shares some of their own experiences in making simple programs and plans to try building more complex games, taking advantage of the Master System’s power.

In the comments, some people say that the Master System was technically better than the NES, but struggled to get popular in some countries because Nintendo had more games and better marketing. Others remember playing the Master System and enjoying its graphics and sound, especially in Europe and Brazil where it was more common. Some users point out that, despite the Master System’s strengths, most game developers focused on the NES because it sold more units, so the best games were often on Nintendo’s system.

A few commenters discuss how Sega’s design made it easier for hobbyists to learn programming, while Nintendo’s tricks made more impressive games possible for experts. There are also stories about how hard it was to find Master System cartridges in North America, but how in places like Brazil, the system stayed popular for many years. Some users share technical tips about programming on these old systems, and others reflect on how small hardware details led to big differences in the types of games people played.

One commenter mentions that the Master System’s graphics looked sharper than the NES, but that the NES had a special “charm” because of its unique color choices and effects. Another person says they wish more companies today made hardware as open and easy to hack as these old consoles. There’s a sense of nostalgia, with people remembering the simple fun of playing or making games for these systems, and some hoping that retro hardware will inspire new generations of programmers.

## CHIP8 – writing emulator, assembler, example game and VHDL hardware impl

- 原文链接: [CHIP8 – writing emulator, assembler, example game and VHDL hardware impl](http://blog.dominikrudnik.pl/chip8-emulator-assembler-game-vhdl)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45804295)

This article is about building a CHIP-8 system from scratch, including an emulator, assembler, a simple game, and even a hardware version using VHDL. CHIP-8 is a small virtual machine used in the 1970s for simple games, making it great for learning about computers.

The author starts by making an emulator in C. This emulator copies the CHIP-8 system with its 16 small registers, a simple stack, timers, keypad, and a 64x32 pixel screen. The code fetches and decodes instructions in a straightforward way, using big if-else blocks to handle each opcode. The hardest part is the drawing instruction, which reads sprite data from memory and updates the screen using XOR logic. The author follows a well-known CHIP-8 reference to get the details right.

Next, the author writes a simple assembler in C++. The assembler turns human-readable CHIP-8 assembly into machine code. It uses a tokenizer to break the code into parts, then matches patterns to generate opcodes. The assembler does everything in one pass, so it fixes up label addresses at the end (like a simple linker). 

For the game, the author chooses to make a flappy bird clone in CHIP-8 assembly. The code manages the bird, pipes, and score, using the limited instructions available. One clever trick is self-modifying code: since the draw instruction needs the sprite height as a constant, the code writes the right value into the instruction itself to allow for different pipe heights.

Finally, the author builds a hardware version using VHDL on an FPGA board. The hardware uses a clock divider, display drivers, and a VGA signal generator. RAM and VRAM are handled using block memory, and a finite state machine runs the CHIP-8 instructions. Drawing is done in a simple way, not optimized for speed, but it works. The author mentions some tweaks are needed for perfect compatibility, but basic games run fine.

In the comments, many people like the project and say CHIP-8 is a great way to learn about emulators and hardware. Some share their own CHIP-8 projects or point out that building a full stack like this (emulator, assembler, game, hardware) is impressive. Others talk about their favorite CHIP-8 games, or how the platform is good for teaching computer basics. 

A few users ask about ways to improve the design—like making the drawing faster or using pipelining in hardware. Some mention that the author’s assembly and hardware code could be cleaner, but understand this was for learning, not production. There are also questions about self-modifying code and why it is needed in such a simple system. People praise the clear explanations and the open-source code, saying it helps them learn.

One person suggests that integrating the VGA and memory better would make the hardware cleaner. Another asks about making the assembler multi-pass to handle labels more easily. Some comment on the joy of seeing a game like flappy bird on such a small system. Many agree that CHIP-8 is a fun platform and a perfect "first emulator" project. Overall, readers find the project inspiring and helpful for anyone interested in low-level programming or hardware design.
