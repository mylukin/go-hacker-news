Hello everyone, this is the 2025-07-31 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we’ll share stories about long-term projects, new open-source AI models, programming culture, network protocols, and some practical tech tips and news.

Let’s begin with a deep dive into very long-term projects. An article discussed how some problems and creations can only be solved or built slowly, sometimes over centuries. For example, math puzzles like Fermat’s Last Theorem took hundreds of years and many new ideas before they were solved. Famous buildings such as Notre Dame and Sagrada Familia took more than a century to build, with Sagrada Familia still not finished after 140 years. In science, projects like the Cape Grim Air Archive have been collecting air since 1978, and the Framingham Heart Study has tracked heart health since 1948. The Central England Temperature record goes back to 1659. LIGO, which found gravitational waves, started as an idea in the 1960s and succeeded in 2016. There’s also the E. coli long-term evolution experiment, running since 1988, and the pitch drop experiment, which began in 1927 and is still going. The “Clock of the Long Now” is being made to last ten thousand years.

The article also lists tech projects that may stay important for a very long time, like Linux and Wikipedia. Standards like ASCII or TCP/IP might last for centuries. The 2nd Avenue Subway in New York took more than 70 years to open its first section, and some companies, such as Kongo Gumi in Japan, have lasted over 1,400 years. The article asks which projects must be slow and which ones we could make faster.

In the comments, people shared even more examples and debated what makes long-term projects possible. Some were amazed by humans’ ability to plan for generations. Others said these projects often fail due to war, money, or lost interest. Some wonder if today’s society cares too much about quick results and does not support slow, careful work anymore. Open source software could last a long time if people keep caring about it. Stable governments or strong traditions can help, as seen with old cathedrals and companies. Technology might speed up some slow work, but not all—some problems just need time. There are worries that big changes in society could kill slow projects. Many find it inspiring to build things that outlive us. Others ask if we need more long-term projects, or if we should focus on faster results. A few shared personal stories about working on slow projects and the feeling of not seeing them finished.

Next, Krea has released the open weights for their new image model, FLUX.1 Krea, which was made with Black Forest Labs. The focus is on better aesthetic control and image quality, avoiding the usual “AI look.” The team says that most models today try to do well on technical benchmarks, which leads to boring, smooth images. Old ways of judging image quality, like FID and CLIP Score, are not enough, and even tools for measuring aesthetics can be biased. Human taste is too personal for a single number.

FLUX.1 Krea used a two-step training process. First, it learned from many images, even “bad” ones, to understand variety. Then, the team refined the model by picking a clear style and removing unwanted looks. They started with a raw model from Black Forest Labs and used supervised fine-tuning with hand-picked images, then used reinforcement learning with human feedback. The lessons learned were: quality of images matters more than quantity, and models should train for a strong style, then let users personalize.

Hacker News readers were happy about the open release and focus on aesthetics. Some asked for more technical details, hoping to use them in their own projects. A few worried that “opinionated” models might fit only a small group’s taste, but others said open weights mean the community can fine-tune in new directions. There was debate about the value of benchmarks, with some saying user feedback is more important. Many are excited for future research on personalizing aesthetics, though collecting feedback may be hard for small teams.

Moving on, one article looked back at the programming language Perl and how programmers used to be more humble. Perl was messy and hard to read, but flexible—there was never just one right way to write code. This made Perl feel “human” with its quirks, like a real language. The writer prefers Python now, but misses the humility Perl taught. He says modern programming is too focused on perfection and strictness, forgetting that code is for people, not just machines. We need to accept messiness and complexity.

In the comments, people shared fond memories of Perl, saying it taught them to be creative and find their own way. Others liked that newer languages are simpler and easier to read. Some say Perl’s decline is more about the tech industry’s changes—more programmers want clear rules. Many wish for a balance between order and creativity. A few hope Perl or its ideas could come back, though most think it’s unlikely.

Another article talked about bringing the QUIC protocol into the Linux kernel. QUIC is a modern network protocol that makes connections faster and more secure than TCP. It runs on top of UDP and encrypts all its important data, making it hard to block or inspect. It can also send many streams of data at once, so one dropped packet does not stop everything.

Until now, QUIC has mostly worked in user space, not in the kernel. Putting it in the kernel could make it faster and easier for more programs to use. The first version is not as fast as TCP or user-space QUIC yet, because of missing hardware support and other technical reasons, but these problems may be solved as time goes on.

In the comments, users were excited to see kernel QUIC, saying it’s overdue. Others pointed out that right now, it is slower than TCP, so there’s no reason to switch yet. Some worry about how hard it will be to maintain QUIC in the kernel and fear it might slow down progress. Others think kernel support will make the Internet faster for everyone in the future. Some discussions focused on security, the difficulty of changing old protocols, and the benefits of kernel support versus user-space solutions. Most agree this is a big step forward, but there are still many challenges before kernel QUIC is as fast and trusted as TCP.

Next, MCP-Use is a new tool that lets you connect any large language model to any Model Context Protocol server. With MCP-Use, you can build custom AI agents that use tools like web browsers, file systems, or even 3D modeling software, all with open-source code. It’s easy to install, works with many LLMs, and supports real-time streaming. You can limit what tools an agent can use for safety, and there’s a cloud sandbox for easy setup.

Users in the comments liked that MCP-Use is open source and makes it easy to build agent workflows. They shared ideas for automating real-world tasks. Some asked questions about security, especially when giving AI access to tools like file systems. There was interest in the sandbox mode to keep things safe. Some wanted more beginner-friendly documentation and support for other programming languages. Most comments were positive, seeing MCP-Use as a helpful step for better AI agents.

Another article explained how Google’s Gemini Embedding model is making AI systems smarter, especially for search and answering questions. Gemini Embedding is used by companies like Box, re:cap, Everlaw, Roo Code, Mindlid, and Interaction Co. to sort and search documents, emails, code, and more, often with better accuracy and speed than before. The model packs important info tightly and works well with many languages.

In the comments, users liked the technical and speed improvements, as well as the multilingual support. Some said the results should be taken with care, since most tests come from the companies themselves. A few developers asked about cost, open source status, and more details on the model’s features. There were worries about privacy and data security as these tools grow. Some shared tips from their own tests and said setup was easy, but they want to see more community benchmarks.

Ubiquiti has released UniFi OS Server, letting users self-host their UniFi network tools on their own computers instead of having to use Ubiquiti’s hardware. It works on Windows and Linux, and you can run UniFi Network, InnerSpace, and UniFi Identity together. The setup is simple, and you can import old networks or backups. For Linux, there are command-line steps and a script for HTTPS. Many users are happy about being able to self-host, run more powerful hardware, and manage bigger networks.

Some users are careful, remembering Ubiquiti’s past issues with cloud lock-in or dropped features. They ask about security, long-term support, and whether all UniFi services will be supported. Some want Docker support or easier updates for Linux. Overall, most see this as a good change but are careful about trusting Ubiquiti’s long-term plans.

In another story, a MacBook Pro with an M1 Max chip started losing battery overnight, even when not being used. The writer used the terminal tool “pmset -g log” and made his own tool to read the tough logs, but still could not find the problem. Later, he tried an app called Sleep Aid, which showed that “Wake for maintenance” was off. Turning it on fixed the battery drain.

Comments were full of similar stories, with users saying sleep issues are common and hard to debug. Many liked the writer’s approach and suggested using third-party tools. Some said certain apps can keep Macs awake, and a few noted older Intel MacBooks did not have these issues. Users found the “Wake for maintenance” option confusing and suggested checking settings after every update. Many hope Apple will make sleep management simpler in the future.

There was also a deep dive into how the 1936 Universal Pictures logo was made, showing a spinning globe and bright stars—all before computers. The team used plexiglass, glowing zinc sulfide, painted globes, and special camera tricks to combine all the effects. It took six months to finish, and the globe model was later reused in a science fiction movie.

People in the comments were impressed by the care and skill needed for this work. They liked learning about the glowing material and how the effects were made. Some asked about the shimmering star effect and pointed out the globe’s later use in film. Most appreciated the patience and creativity of the artists.

Finally, an article explained Secure Boot certificate rollover. Secure Boot keeps your computer safe by only letting trusted software start. Microsoft is rolling out a new Secure Boot certificate, but for most users, this will not cause problems. Most computers are already updated, and almost all operating systems will keep working. Only people using old or custom setups might need to update their software.

In the comments, some people worry about hardware becoming more locked down. Others are glad for better security. There are stories about old hardware breaking after a certificate change, and some point out that open-source tools give more control. Many agree this change is not a big deal for most users, though some wish the system was simpler.

That’s all for today’s episode. We saw how both slow-building projects and fast-moving technology shape our world, and how the tech community is always balancing tradition, openness, and progress. Thank you for listening to Hacker News Daily Podcast. See you next time.
