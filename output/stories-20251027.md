## Easy RISC-V: An interactive introduction to RISC-V assembly programming

- 原文链接: [Easy RISC-V: An interactive introduction to RISC-V assembly programming](https://dramforever.github.io/easyriscv/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45726192)

This article is about an interactive tutorial that helps people learn RISC-V assembly programming. The tutorial is for those who know a bit about low-level computer science but are new to RISC-V.

The article explains what RISC-V is: an open, modern processor design that is simple, free to use, and growing in popularity. It shows how RISC-V has a clean set of instructions without complex extras, and how anyone can use or build on it without legal problems. The tutorial uses an online emulator so you can write and run RISC-V assembly code right in your browser.

First, you learn about registers, the program counter, and how instructions are written. The tutorial covers how to use instructions for arithmetic (like add and subtract), bitwise operations, comparisons, and shifts. It explains that RISC-V does not include multiplication or division in its core set, so those are only available as extensions. You also learn about working with memory: how to load and store data, use bytes and half-words, and how memory-mapped I/O is used for things like output.

Next, the tutorial describes how to use jumps and branches for loops and conditionals, and how to write and call functions. It covers calling conventions—the rules for which registers hold arguments and return values—and how to use the stack for saving information during function calls.

The article then moves to more advanced topics. It talks about privilege levels (Machine and User mode), control and status registers (CSRs), exceptions, and how to write a very simple operating system kernel. There are clear examples of how to handle exceptions, make system calls, and switch between privilege levels. The tutorial also points out things it does not cover, such as 64-bit RISC-V, compressed instructions, and some details about the real architecture.

The Hacker News comments show a range of opinions. Many people are happy to see a new, easy-to-use guide for RISC-V assembly, saying it is well-written and helpful for learning. Some compare it to the older "Easy 6502" tutorial and like that it uses an emulator in the browser. Commenters mention that RISC-V is spreading quickly in the embedded world and that open architectures are important for hardware freedom.

Some readers talk about using RISC-V for teaching students, saying this guide is a good starting point. Others bring up technical details, like the lack of multiplication in the basic instruction set, or how the stack works. A few wish the tutorial was shorter, or had more real-world examples, but most agree it is a strong resource.

There are questions about how RISC-V compares with older architectures like x86 or MIPS, and some people discuss how open standards can help small companies or hobbyists. Others point out that writing assembly is rare for most programmers today, but understanding it helps with debugging and systems work. Some people share their own projects using RISC-V, or suggest improvements for the emulator and examples.

Overall, the community sees this tutorial as a useful, friendly way to get started with RISC-V, and many plan to share it with students or colleagues. There is excitement about the growth of RISC-V and the value of open, simple hardware design, with some hope that more learning tools like this will appear in the future.

## Claude for Excel

- 原文链接: [Claude for Excel](https://www.claude.com/claude-for-excel)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45722639)

Claude for Excel is a new tool that brings the Claude AI assistant right into Microsoft Excel. It helps users understand, edit, and debug complex spreadsheets by answering questions, explaining formulas, and tracing errors.

Claude can look at your whole Excel workbook, including formulas and links across many tabs. If you have a question about a formula or how numbers are connected, you can ask Claude and get an answer with clear cell references. It can help you change values and see the effect across the whole sheet, without breaking the formulas. Claude also helps find and explain errors like #REF! or #VALUE!, showing you exactly where and why something went wrong. You can use Claude to build a new financial model or fill in an existing template, and it keeps all your formatting and structure safe.

The tool is in beta, so it’s only available for some users on higher-tier plans (Max, Team, or Enterprise) through a waitlist. Claude works inside your company’s security rules, but you should always double-check changes before using them for important work. Right now, it does not work with some advanced Excel features like pivot tables, conditional formatting, data validation, macros, or VBA, but the team is working on these. Claude understands common financial modeling rules and can open .xlsx and .xlsm files, but there are file size limits.

In the Hacker News comments, some people are excited about having an AI helper for Excel, saying it could save time and help people who are not Excel experts. Others are worried about trusting AI with important data, especially if it sometimes makes mistakes. A few users point out the risk of sending private business data to the cloud, even with promised security. Some say that not supporting pivot tables or macros makes the tool less useful for now. There are comments about how this could change how people use Excel at work, with less need for expert help. Others think it will be most helpful for checking or debugging spreadsheets, not building them from scratch. People also discuss the cost, saying it may only make sense for big companies. Several users hope future updates will add more features, and some wonder if other AI tools will do the same for Google Sheets and other apps.

## Study finds growing social circles may fuel polarization

- 原文链接: [Study finds growing social circles may fuel polarization](https://phys.org/news/2025-10-friends-division-social-circles-fuel.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45725009)

A new study says that as people get more close friends, society becomes more divided. The researchers found that between 2008 and 2010, the average number of close friends jumped from two to about four or five, and at the same time, political polarization also rose quickly. For many years, people had about two close friends who could influence their opinions, but this changed suddenly. The scientists used surveys and a model to show that when people have more connections, groups form that are more tightly knit but disagree more with other groups. These groups become “bubbles” with strong ideas and little contact between them. The study says this is like a phase change in physics—once people have more than three or four close friends, polarization rises fast. This shift happened when smartphones and social media became popular, which made it easier to connect but also easier to break off friendships. With more friends, people feel less need to be tolerant, because if one friend leaves, there are others. This can reduce overall tolerance in society and make it harder for people with different ideas to talk. The researchers warn that this can be bad for democracy, because democracy needs people to talk and understand each other.

On Hacker News, some people agree that social media and smartphones changed how friendships work and made it easier to join groups with the same ideas. Others think the study is interesting but say that having more friends should help people see more points of view, not less. Some users point out that “close friends” might not really be close—maybe people are just counting more online contacts. There is debate about whether the problem is too many friends or the kind of friends people have. One comment says the main problem is the algorithms that show us what we already like, not the number of friends. Another user wonders if the real reason for more division is that people spend more time online and less time in face-to-face groups like sports or church. Some say that being able to drop friends easily makes people less patient, while others say that social media just shows us problems that were always there. A few think that polarization is not new, but now we can see it more because of new technology. Others believe that the study is too simple and that politics and news also play a big part. Overall, people are interested in the idea but question if having more friends is really the main cause of division.

- 原文链接: [10M people watched a YouTuber shim a lock; the lock company sued him – bad idea](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/suing-a-popular-youtuber-who-shimmed-a-130-lock-what-could-possibly-go-wrong/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45720376)

A popular YouTuber made a video showing how to open a common lock using a simple tool. Over 10 million people watched the video, so the lock company decided to sue the YouTuber.

In the video, the YouTuber showed how easy it is to open the lock using a thin piece of plastic, called a shim. He explained that many locks like this are not very secure. He wanted to teach people about lock safety, not help criminals. The YouTuber often makes videos like this to show problems with products and help companies improve. After the video got popular, the lock company blamed him for showing their lock was weak. They said he was teaching people how to break in. The company sued him, hoping to stop the video and protect their business. But their plan did not work well. More people talked about the video and the lawsuit. News sites and bloggers wrote stories about it. People started to question the company’s actions. Some experts said the real problem was the poor lock design, not the video. They said the company should fix their product instead of attacking the YouTuber.

In the comments, many people agreed with the YouTuber. They said his video was helpful and made them think about their own home safety. Some joked that the lawsuit made the problem more famous, calling it the “Streisand effect.” Others said the company looked bad for suing instead of improving their product. A few people worried that showing lock flaws could help criminals, but most agreed that security problems should be public. Some commenters shared their own stories about weak locks. Others talked about how important it is to learn from experts, even if the truth is uncomfortable. A few suggested that companies should work with hackers and testers to make better products. Many people said the lawsuit was a bad idea and would likely fail. Overall, most thought open information helps everyone be safer.

## Pyrex catalog from from 1938 with hand-drawn lab glassware [pdf]

- 原文链接: [Pyrex catalog from from 1938 with hand-drawn lab glassware [pdf]](https://exhibitdb.cmog.org/opacimages/Images/Pyrex/Rakow_1000132877.pdf)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45721801)

This article is a 1938 catalog from Corning Glass Works showing Pyrex laboratory glassware, with hand-drawn pictures and detailed technical info. It explains how Pyrex glassware became important for labs, especially during World War I, when getting good glass from Europe was hard.

The catalog describes why Pyrex glass is special. Pyrex is a type of borosilicate glass. It has low thermal expansion, so it doesn’t break easily when heated or cooled fast. It’s very strong and doesn’t react with most chemicals, which means it doesn’t change the things you put inside. The glass can be sterilized many times without getting cloudy or weak. Pyrex also has high clarity, so you can easily see what’s inside.

The catalog gives lots of numbers showing how little Pyrex glass dissolves in acids and bases, and how it stays strong even at high temperatures. It talks about how each piece of Pyrex lab glass is marked with a special trademark, which means it passed strict quality checks. There are also details about the different types of glassware: beakers, bottles, flasks, tubes, and more. Each item has size, price, and packaging info. The drawings help people see what each shape looks like and how it’s used.

There’s advice for how to order, with discounts for larger orders, and rules about getting special glassware made for unique needs. The catalog even lists labels for reagent bottles, like "Acetic Acid," "Alcohol," and other chemicals, showing the wide range of lab work Pyrex supported. The catalog is not just a product list—it’s a record of how labs worked in the 1930s and how Pyrex helped science move forward.

Hacker News commenters found the hand-drawn pictures charming and admired the care taken in the catalog’s design. Some talked about using similar glassware in school or work, and how Pyrex is still trusted for lab and kitchen use today. Others pointed out how technical the catalog is, with lots of data and precise measurements—something rare in modern catalogs.

Several people discussed how the switch from European to American glassware changed science in the US, making it more independent. Some mentioned that modern glassware catalogs are less detailed, and that old catalogs like this are useful for learning about history and glassmaking. A few noted how Pyrex for kitchens is now often made from a different type of glass, which can break more easily, while lab Pyrex still uses borosilicate.

Others reflected on the price lists and how affordable lab glassware was, comparing it to today’s costs. Some users were nostalgic about the look and feel of old paper catalogs, saying they seem more personal than online stores. One or two commenters wished more modern products had this level of technical data and transparency. Some also joked about the strange or funny shapes of some glassware, and how some items haven’t changed much in almost 100 years.

## Simplify Your Code: Functional Core, Imperative Shell

- 原文链接: [Simplify Your Code: Functional Core, Imperative Shell](https://testing.googleblog.com/2025/10/simplify-your-code-functional-core.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45701901)

The article explains how to make your code easier to test and understand by using a “functional core, imperative shell” style. It shows that mixing business rules with things like database or email calls makes code hard to work with. 

In the old way, one function does everything: it checks users, filters them, and sends emails, all mixed together. The article says to split this up. The “functional core” is a group of pure functions that only work with data and do not touch the outside world. For example, one function picks which users’ accounts expired, and another builds the email messages for them. These functions do not send emails or read from the database; they just use the data you give them and return results. The “imperative shell” is responsible for things like talking to the database and sending emails. It calls the core functions to get the results it needs, then does the real-world actions. The article shows code samples before and after this change, making it clear how much cleaner the new version looks. The new way also makes it easy to add new features, like sending a reminder email, by just writing a new pure function and calling it from the shell. The article links to Gary Bernhardt’s talk, where this pattern first became well-known.

In the comments, many people like this pattern and say it helps with testing, because pure functions are easy to check. Some share that using pure functions means fewer bugs, since there are no hidden changes or surprises. Others note that this pattern is not new, but it is a good reminder, and they use it in their daily work. A few people say it can be hard to keep things pure in large programs, or with things like time and random numbers. Some think that it’s not always worth the extra work to split up the code for small projects. One person warns that too much splitting can make code harder to follow. There’s also talk about how this style fits well with functional programming languages, but you can use it in any language. Some say it helps with scaling teams and codebases, while others think it can be overkill for simple scripts. Finally, many agree that even a little separation between logic and side effects makes code easier to read and fix.

## Why Busy Beaver hunters fear the Antihydra

- 原文链接: [Why Busy Beaver hunters fear the Antihydra](https://benbrubaker.com/why-busy-beaver-hunters-fear-the-antihydra/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45723359)

This article talks about the “busy beaver” problem in computer science and why researchers are now stuck because of a special Turing machine called Antihydra. The busy beaver problem is about finding out how long the most complex simple computer programs (Turing machines) can run before they stop, given a certain number of rules.

For a Turing machine with five rules, called BB(5), people found the answer: it runs for 47,176,870 steps before stopping. Now, researchers want to find BB(6) (the version with six rules), but they can’t, because they don’t know if a machine called Antihydra ever stops. Deciding this is very hard, like solving a famous math problem called the Collatz conjecture.

Turing machines work by following simple rules to change numbers on a tape. To find the busy beaver number, you list all possible machines, check which ones stop, and see which takes the longest. But figuring out if a machine halts is sometimes impossible—even for computers—because some machines just go on forever in strange ways.

Some Turing machines, like the known BB(5), act like simple number games: you start with a number, do certain steps, and stop if you hit a special value. The Collatz conjecture works like this: take a number, if it’s even, halve it; if it’s odd, triple it and add one; repeat. No one knows if every starting number will always reach 1.

Antihydra acts in a similar way: start with 8, and depending on whether the number is even or odd, you do one of two calculations and keep track of how many times each happens. You stop only if a very special condition is met, which simulations show almost never happens. Antihydra has run for over 270 billion steps without stopping, and experts think it never will—but they can’t prove it.

Researchers call these kinds of machines “cryptids” since they’re mysterious and hard to catch, like Bigfoot. There are now many such cryptids, making it even harder to find more busy beaver numbers. Famous mathematicians have said that math might not be ready to solve these puzzles yet.

In the comments, some readers say the busy beaver problem shows the real limits of what math and computers can do—some answers are just too hard to find. Others are excited by how amateur researchers are making progress, and that the problem is now more approachable thanks to online communities. Some users debate whether finding high-level patterns (like the Collatz link) is always useful, since some machines might just act randomly. A few people suggest that problems like this are important because they show why certain questions in math may never have answers. There’s also discussion about how “probviously” (probably obvious) results, like with Antihydra, challenge our ideas about proof and certainty. Others enjoy the playful naming of machines (like Hydra and Bigfoot), saying it brings fun into serious math. Some hope for new tools or ideas that might one day crack these mysteries. Finally, a few comments reflect on how chasing unsolved problems like busy beaver and Collatz keeps math lively and full of surprises.

## MCP-Scanner – Scan MCP Servers for vulnerabilities

- 原文链接: [MCP-Scanner – Scan MCP Servers for vulnerabilities](https://github.com/cisco-ai-defense/mcp-scanner)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45723699)

This article is about MCP-Scanner, a Python tool from Cisco for checking MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for security problems. MCP-Scanner finds weaknesses in AI server tools by combining three engines: Cisco’s own AI Defense API, YARA rules, and LLM-based analysis.

The scanner works both as a command-line tool and as a REST API server. It can scan not just servers, but also prompts and resources, looking for signs of danger. You can use all three engines at once or pick just one. Authentication is flexible, with support for OAuth and custom API endpoints. You can add your own YARA rules to look for special patterns. The scanner makes detailed reports about what it finds. 

To install, you need Python 3.11 or higher and the uv package manager. You can install it with pip from PyPI or build it from source on GitHub. It works with different LLM providers like OpenAI and AWS Bedrock, and you can set it up using environment variables for your API keys and model choices. 

You can quickly start scanning using a CLI command, for local configs or remote servers, or even run the scanner as an API server to use in web apps or CI/CD pipelines. The CLI has many subcommands to scan different things: remote servers, local configs, specific prompts, or resources. You can use different output formats, like summary, detailed, table, by severity, or raw JSON.

For developers, there is an SDK that lets you run scans from your Python code. The API server exposes endpoints for scanning tools, prompts, and resources. The documentation is detailed and covers everything from architecture to authentication and output formats.

In the comment section, some users say this tool is important because AI integrations can open up new security risks. A few people like the use of YARA and LLMs together, saying it could catch more types of threats. Others are worried about depending too much on AI to judge what is safe, since LLMs can make mistakes. Some users mention it is good that the scanner works with many authentication methods, but they wish there were more free or open-source alternatives to Cisco’s API. There is also a discussion about how easy it is to add custom rules and how well it fits into existing security setups. A few commenters think the tool is a bit complex for new users, but others point out that security is always a bit tricky. Some are happy about the detailed documentation and various output formats, while others suggest making the setup process simpler. Finally, some users ask for real-world examples or reports from people who have already used the tool.

## The new calculus of AI-based coding

- 原文链接: [The new calculus of AI-based coding](https://blog.joemag.dev/2025/10/the-new-calculus-of-ai-based-coding.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45723686)

This article talks about how a team at Amazon is writing most of their code with help from AI coding agents, like Amazon Q or Kiro. They work in a way where humans and AI work together, but a real engineer always checks and approves the code before it is used.

The team uses Rust, a language known for catching mistakes early, which helps both humans and AI avoid bugs. The author calls this “agentic coding” instead of “vibe coding,” meaning the AI is used carefully, not just for fun. The writer says about 80% of their code is now written by AI, but they still review and sometimes finish the code themselves. They break tasks into small parts, use AI to try ideas, and never accept AI code without checking every line.

The team is now working much faster—10 times faster than before, based on their own data. But when you move this fast, small bugs can happen more often. If you used to have a big bug once a year, now you might see one each week. Even if you catch most bugs in testing, they still slow down the team. So, the author says, with higher speed, we must also reduce the number of mistakes by much more.

To stop bugs, the team uses strong testing, including fake versions of outside services for local, full-system tests. With AI’s help, making these tests is much quicker and easier now. Before, this kind of testing was too hard or expensive for most teams. Now, AI can build and update these tests and fake services, making it possible for more teams to use them.

The author also talks about faster build and test systems. When many commits happen each hour, finding and fixing problems must be much quicker—minutes, not hours or days. If testing is slow, changes pile up and it’s hard to know which one broke things.

Communication is another challenge. When teams work faster, they also make more decisions each day. Old ways of talking, like waiting for a Slack reply, can slow everything down. The team found that being in the same office helps a lot—they can talk in person, solve problems quickly, and keep moving. But this is still hard for remote teams.

The article ends by saying that just adding AI to old ways of writing software will not work well. The whole process—testing, deployment, team communication—must change to keep up with faster coding. AI can now help not only to write code, but also to build better testing and teamwork tools.

In the comment section, many readers are interested in the claim of “10x throughput.” Some people are excited and want more data or examples to see if it could work for smaller teams or open-source projects. Others are more skeptical, saying that writing code is not always the hard part—understanding problems and designing good systems is harder, and AI does not always help there.

A few commenters warn about hidden bugs and the risk of moving too fast. They share stories where too many quick changes made systems unstable, even with testing. Some people say that testing fake versions of services is useful, but still cannot catch every real-world issue.

Others talk about the problem of communication for remote or global teams. Some suggest using better tools or more clear documentation, while others think being in the same office is still best for fast teamwork. A few ask if the same results can be done with other languages, not just Rust.

Finally, some readers are hopeful that AI can help small teams do what only big teams could do before, but they agree with the article: teams must also change their habits and systems, not just use AI on top of old ways.
