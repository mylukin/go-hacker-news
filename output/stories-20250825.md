## Google's Liquid Cooling

- 原文链接: [Google's Liquid Cooling](https://chipsandcheese.com/p/googles-liquid-cooling-at-hot-chips)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45016720)

Google is using liquid cooling in its data centers to handle the extra heat from powerful AI chips. The article explains how Google’s TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) servers now use water-based cooling instead of just air.

Water is much better at moving heat than air—about 4000 times better, according to Google. This is important because machine learning chips use a lot of electricity and get very hot. Google’s liquid cooling system uses racks of Coolant Distribution Units (CDUs). These CDUs are like big pumps and radiators for the servers. The coolant from the CDUs moves through hoses to each server, cooling the chips, and then passes the collected heat to the building’s water supply. The coolant and building water never mix; the CDUs only transfer heat between the two.

The chips are cooled in a series, so the last chip in the loop gets the hottest water. Google plans the cooling to make sure every chip, even the last one, stays cool enough. They also use a special “split-flow cold plate” to make cooling more even. For their newer TPU chips (TPUv4), Google removed the chip’s lid (like “delidding” in PC building) so the coolant can touch the chip directly. This is necessary because the newer chips use much more power than before.

Liquid cooling also uses less electricity for cooling than air fans—Google says their pumps need less than 5% of the power that air fans use. In personal computers, this isn’t a big deal, but in huge data centers, saving power means saving money and reducing heat.

Maintenance is a big challenge. Liquid cooling can leak or grow microbes, just like in water-cooled PCs. Google uses quick disconnects for easy fixes and keeps an extra CDU in each rack so they can do repairs without stopping the servers. They test everything for leaks, have alarms for problems, and use scheduled maintenance. This is very different from how PC builders usually handle their cooling, which often means turning the system off.

The article points out that other companies like Nvidia and Rebellions AI are also showing off liquid cooling at tech shows. Some use a mix of fans and water blocks, or fancy setups with chillers.

Hacker News readers had lots of thoughts. Some said that liquid cooling is not new; it has been used in big computers for decades and even in old mainframes. Others pointed out that the AI boom is making better cooling more urgent than ever. A few people worried about leaks and the risk of water damage, but others said Google’s scale and protocols make it safer. Some liked the energy savings, while a few asked if this could work in normal offices or homes. There were also comments about how home PC enthusiasts have done similar things for years, but Google’s systems are much bigger and more complex. Some users wondered if air cooling will ever come back, or if future chips will need even more advanced cooling, like immersion in special liquids. Finally, several readers were curious to see if these cooling ideas will become more common in other industries as chip power keeps rising.

## Google to require developer verification to install and sideload Android apps

- 原文链接: [Google to require developer verification to install and sideload Android apps](https://9to5google.com/2025/08/25/android-apps-developer-verification/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45017028)

Google is planning to make it harder to install or sideload Android apps without extra checks. The company will soon require developers to verify their identity before users can install their apps outside the Play Store.

This means if you want to put an app on your phone that is not from the official store, the developer must prove who they are first. Google says this will help to block malware and keep users safer. Developers will need to send documents like a government ID to Google. Only after Google checks and approves, can the app be installed by others, even if it is downloaded from outside the Play Store. Google says this rule will start soon, but has not set an exact date yet.

The article explains that sideloading is when you install an app from another website or store, not from Google Play. Many people do this for special apps or to avoid Google’s rules. But sometimes, this is how viruses and bad apps get on your phone. Google wants to make it less risky by knowing who made every app. Some developers worry this will make it harder for new or small app makers. Others think it is good because it may reduce scams and dangerous apps.

In the comments, some people say this is Google trying to control Android, making it more closed like Apple’s iPhone. They think Android should stay open, and users should be free to put any app they want on their phone. Others argue safety is important, and too many people get tricked by fake apps. Some are worried that developers in some countries may not have the right documents to get verified, so they could be blocked. A few mention that users who know what they’re doing will find ways around these rules anyway. One commenter points out this could hurt open-source apps, which often don’t have big companies behind them. Another says Google is just trying to avoid bad headlines about malware. Some hope Google will make the process easy and fair, while others think this is just the start of making Android less open. Most agree it is a big change for Android users and developers.

- 原文链接: [Llama Fund: Crowdfund AI Models](https://llama.fund)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45018708)

This article is about Llama Fund, a new platform that helps people and groups crowdfund the training of large AI models. The main idea is to let anyone help pay for AI research, not just big tech companies.

Llama Fund works in three steps. First, an AI researcher or group writes a proposal for a new AI model. This proposal explains what kind of model it is, what data it uses, and what they hope to achieve. Next, the community can give money through the website, like a Kickstarter for AI. When enough money is collected, the team trains the model using computers from many places. They keep everyone updated on the progress. After the model is finished, it is shared as open-source. This means anyone who helped pay can use it, and the whole community can benefit. Llama Fund wants to speed up new ideas in AI and make sure the benefits go to everyone, not just a few companies.

People who like the idea say it can make AI more open and fair. They think sharing the costs can help smaller teams and universities build big models. Supporters also like that the models will be open-source, so anyone can study or use them.

Some commenters have concerns. A few worry about how to check if the money is spent well, or if the models will really be useful. Others ask if there are enough people who care to fund these expensive projects. There are questions about handling big datasets and keeping things safe and private. Some think large companies might just copy the models, making it hard for the community to get value. A few users are excited about the idea of following the training process and learning more about how big AI models are made. Others suggest adding more ways for people to get involved, like helping with data or sharing computer power. Overall, many people see promise in the idea, but they also see some big challenges that Llama Fund will need to solve.

## Social media's next evolution: decentralized, open-source, and scalable

- 原文链接: [Social media's next evolution: decentralized, open-source, and scalable](https://newpublic.substack.com/p/how-blacksky-grew-to-millions-of)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45018773)

This article talks about Blacksky, a new social media app built on decentralized and open-source technology. Blacksky is part of the Bluesky network, but it focuses on building a safe, inclusive space for Black users and communities.

Blacksky uses the AT Protocol, which lets different apps and servers connect and work together, like how an Allen wrench fits many types of furniture. This protocol makes it easy for users to move between apps, keep their data, and interact across the network, not just within one company’s platform. Blacksky started as a small project to highlight Black voices and keep the community safe, growing to two million users without spending money on ads. All growth was natural, showing strong community interest.

Most social media today is owned by big companies, and users have little control. Blacksky and similar projects want to change that by letting users and communities own their space and set their own rules. Blacksky built its own moderation tools to deal with harassment, hate speech, and harmful content, giving users the power to choose what they see and how they are protected. The moderation team comes from the community, and their work aims to protect users, not just follow company policy.

The article explains how Blacksky’s technology stack helps keep the platform safe and running smoothly. It includes tools for finding and blocking toxic content, automated alerts, and easy ways for users to manage their own experience. The team also built a global data relay to make the network stronger and less dependent on any one company. Blacksky shares its open-source tools so other groups can build their own communities, too.

Commenters on Hacker News have mixed opinions. Some love the open-source, decentralized model and think it’s the future of social media. They like that Blacksky gives control to users and makes it easy to build new communities. Others worry about moderation—if every group controls its own rules, some fear more hate or echo chambers could form. A few people question if decentralization really solves the big problems of social media, like spam and misinformation, or just makes them harder to manage.

Many commenters are interested in the technical side, asking how AT Protocol works, how moderation is handled, and how data moves between apps. Some point out that email is also decentralized, but big companies still control most accounts, so power can still become centralized over time. Others share hope that open protocols will allow more innovation and better user choice, even if it’s not a perfect solution.

Some worry that building safe spaces for specific groups may lead to more division, while others say it’s important for people to have control over their own online spaces. A few bring up the challenge of getting enough people to run servers and keep them safe, especially if moderation is hard work. Overall, the comments show excitement for new ideas, but also lots of questions about how they will work in the real world.

## A visual introduction to big O notation

- 原文链接: [A visual introduction to big O notation](https://samwho.dev/big-o/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45002182)

This article explains what big O notation is and why it matters for programmers. Big O helps describe how fast or slow a function is as the input gets bigger, without needing to run the code and time it.

The author starts by looking at a simple function that sums numbers from 1 to n using a loop. When n gets bigger, the time it takes grows in a straight line—this is called linear time, or O(n). Next, they show a faster way to sum numbers using a formula. This new function is very quick, no matter how big n is. This is constant time, or O(1).

Big O notation uses the smallest term, so O(n) is used instead of O(2n) or O(n + 1). The article then explains bubble sort, which is a sorting method. Bubble sort checks every pair of numbers many times. In the worst case, it takes n times n steps, or O(n^2), called quadratic time. For searching, the article explains binary search, where you guess the middle and cut your choices in half each time. This is much faster than checking each number one by one. Binary search is O(log n), which grows very slowly as n gets bigger.

The article gives examples of how to write faster code by choosing better data structures. For example, using a Set for checking if an item is in a list can be O(1), but building the Set in the first place is O(n). It also points out mistakes like using indexOf inside a loop, which makes code much slower—O(n^2) instead of O(n). The article finishes by talking about caching results to speed up repeated calculations, like with the factorial function. Even though caching does not always improve the worst case, it helps in practice.

In the comment section, some readers say the article is a clear and friendly introduction to big O. Others like the visual examples and think they help beginners understand. A few mention that real-world performance can depend on things besides big O, like cache and hardware. Some commenters remind others that O(1) does not always mean instant—sometimes a constant-time function is just a slow step that does not change with input. There are also comments pointing out that for small inputs, a slower algorithm might still run faster. A few people discuss how big O is about worst-case growth, and that average or best-case can matter in practice. Some suggest adding more on space complexity or other types of time complexities. Others share their own favorite resources for learning big O. Several thank the author for making a tricky topic easier to understand.

- 原文链接: [Launch HN: April (YC S25) – Voice AI to manage your email and calendar](item?id=45015230)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45015230)

A new company called April, from Y Combinator’s Summer 2025 batch, has launched a voice AI assistant that helps people manage email and calendar tasks. The main idea is to let users talk to April like a real person, so they can handle work faster and easier.

April connects to your email and calendar accounts. You can ask it to read your emails out loud, find important messages, or summarize long threads. It can also help you schedule meetings, send replies, or set reminders, all using your voice. The founders say this saves time, especially for busy people who get lots of emails each day. They also talk about privacy and say your data stays safe and private. April works on both desktop and mobile, and it uses the latest AI voice and language models. The team is testing April with early users, like salespeople and executives, who need to manage many emails and appointments every day. They hope to make the tool better by learning from user feedback.

In the Hacker News comments, some people are excited about April. They say it could help them save time and reduce stress from email overload. Others are happy to see more voice AI tools coming to market. Some users worry about privacy, asking if April stores or reads their private emails. A few people wonder if the AI can really understand complex email threads or pick out important details. Some say they would only use it if it works quickly and does not make mistakes. Others are interested in using April for people with disabilities or those who struggle with typing. A few comment that voice assistants have not worked well in the past, but they are curious if new AI models can do better now. Some users ask about pricing and if April will work with different email providers. Others suggest features, like smart filters or connecting to other productivity apps. Overall, the community is hopeful but wants to see real-world results.

## How RubyGems.org protects OSS infrastructure

- 原文链接: [How RubyGems.org protects OSS infrastructure](https://blog.rubygems.org/2025/08/25/rubygems-security-response.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45016794)

RubyGems.org shared how they protect the open-source Ruby community from harmful software, after recent news about fake Ruby gems stealing credentials. The article explains their security system and how they handled a case of malicious packages found by Socket.dev.

RubyGems.org uses several steps to find dangerous gems. First, every new gem is checked automatically—both by reading the code and running tests to see what it does. They use special security tools for this. Each gem gets a risk score, and gems with high scores are looked at by a real person. They also go back and scan old gems as their detection tools get better, which helps find threats from the past. RubyGems also listens to warnings from security groups and works with other software registries to spot problems.

Most bad gems are caught by RubyGems before anyone else reports them. When a gem is marked as suspicious, a security engineer checks if it’s really dangerous. If they’re not sure, another team member helps. Confirmed bad gems are removed, and every action is written down for records. Sometimes, they also block names that could be used to trick people.

In the case reported by Socket.dev, RubyGems found and removed almost all the bad gems before the public report. They deleted the accounts that uploaded them. After Socket.dev reported some more, RubyGems took those out too. Trusted, popular gems were not affected. RubyGems encourages the community to send in any reports of problems by email or Slack and promises to reply quickly.

Handling these threats is hard work and needs both sponsors and unpaid volunteers. Most of the security team has been doing this for years out of dedication. RubyGems asks companies using their service to help fund it, so they can keep protecting the community.

From the comments, many users praised RubyGems for their fast response and careful work, especially compared to larger ecosystems like npm, where security problems can be bigger. Some people noted that the number of bad gems was small, which made them feel safer. Others worried that all ecosystems are at risk and suggested more automation and funding is needed for these projects. A few comments said it’s hard to trust any code from the internet and asked for even more transparency. Some praised the volunteers for their years of effort, saying this invisible work is what keeps open source running. Others shared ideas about better ways to catch bad packages, like more community reporting or stricter upload rules. Finally, there were calls for big tech companies who rely on RubyGems to give more support and for users to check what code they use.

## What are OKLCH colors?

- 原文链接: [What are OKLCH colors?](https://jakub.kr/components/oklch-colors)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45010876)

OKLCH is a new way to describe colors that matches how people actually see them. The article explains how OKLCH helps make colors look more even and predictable, especially in web design.

Most people know about RGB and HSL color models, but OKLCH is based on lightness, chroma (color strength), and hue (color type). This system uses the OKLab color space, which means if you change only hue, your colors will have the same brightness and strength, just different colors. This is not true for HSL—if you try to make buttons with the same HSL values but different hues, some will look darker or lighter than others. OKLCH fixes this, so your designs look more balanced.

The article also explains "gamut," which is the range of colors a screen can show. Modern screens can show more colors (like Display-P3), and OKLCH can use these, but if your screen does not support them, the browser will show the closest possible color. Sometimes, you can write color values that no screen can show, so you have to be careful or the color will be “clipped” and look wrong.

Gradients in OKLCH are smoother and more even than in RGB, but sometimes they can create colors you did not expect. Some tools use a slightly different method (OKLab) to make gradients more predictable.

OKLCH colors now work in most modern browsers, but not all old ones. The article shows how to use CSS fallbacks, so your site still works everywhere. There’s also a tool called oklch.fyi, where you can try making your own OKLCH colors and palettes.

In the Hacker News comments, many people liked OKLCH for its predictability and even colors. Some said it made their designs look more professional, especially for buttons and color palettes. Others talked about trouble with gradients—sometimes the colors in between look strange. A few users worried about writing colors that don’t work on all screens, and some pointed out that browser support, while good, is not perfect yet.

Some developers shared tips on using OKLCH with CSS frameworks, and others asked if OKLCH would become the new standard in web design. There were also comments about accessibility: several readers said OKLCH made it easier to check if color contrast was good for people with low vision. A few people felt that RGB was still easier for simple projects, but most agreed that OKLCH is a big step forward. Overall, the comment section showed excitement but also some caution as people try out OKLCH in their own work.

## Turning a Decommissioned iPhone into a UniFi Protect Camera

- 原文链接: [Turning a Decommissioned iPhone into a UniFi Protect Camera](https://www.caseyliss.com/2025/8/15/a-rube-goldberg-camera)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45001815)

This article talks about turning an old iPhone into a UniFi Protect camera. The author wanted to use an old phone as a security camera with the UniFi system, which normally only works with its own cameras.

The author explains that UniFi Protect can work with some third-party cameras if they support ONVIF, but iPhones do not support this out of the box. The author looked for an iPhone app that could stream video using ONVIF but did not find one. He learned that ONVIF is mainly for connecting the camera, while RTSP is used for the actual video stream.

He found an app called "IP Camera Lite" that can send an RTSP video stream from the iPhone. To check if it worked, he used a tool called ffplay to watch the stream on his computer, and it worked fine.

Next, he needed to make the RTSP video stream look like an ONVIF camera for UniFi to find it. He found a Docker program called "rtsp-to-onvif" that can do this job. He ran it on his Synology server and changed some settings: the network interface, the iPhone’s stream address, and the video size. He got the needed numbers by looking at the output from ffplay.

After setting up everything, he turned on the “Discover 3rd-Party Cameras” option in UniFi Protect. The system found the new camera, and he added it using the default username and password. It did not work at first, but after fixing the settings, the camera showed up in UniFi Protect. Now, he can use the iPhone as a security camera and stop using his old surveillance software.

In the comments, many people liked the creative use of old devices. Some said it is a smart way to recycle old iPhones and save money. Others pointed out that this setup is a bit complicated and might break if the apps or software update. A few users shared that they also use old phones as cameras with different apps or systems. Some worried about the security of using default usernames and passwords or running extra software like Docker containers. Others said that the video quality might not be as good as real security cameras, but for simple needs, it works fine. Some commenters were impressed by the troubleshooting and detailed guide, while a few wondered if it is worth the effort compared to just buying a new camera. Overall, most people found the project fun and useful, and they liked learning about connecting old hardware to new systems.
