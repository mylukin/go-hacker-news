Hello everyone, this is the 2025-06-26 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have stories on using RAM for fast file storage, DeepMind’s new AI for genetics, an AI language practice app, creative text layout scripts, a major DHCP server update, native web templating debates, one-shot learning robots, memory access speed tests, a new AI browser automation tool, and the latest Matrix protocol release. Let’s get started.

First, we look at an article about using /dev/shm to write files directly into your computer’s RAM instead of the disk. This method is helpful if you want to save the life of your hard drives or SD cards by reducing write cycles. /dev/shm is a special folder on most Unix systems. Files saved here are kept only in memory and are lost after a reboot. The author shows that working with files in RAM is much faster than on disk. For example, opening and editing small text files—like Wiktionary word lists—happens almost instantly. Even larger files, up to a few gigabytes, can be handled easily if you have enough RAM. Thousands of small files can fit in just 1 GB. The main warning is that all files in /dev/shm disappear when you restart, so use it only for temporary work. Command-line tools like grep also work faster in RAM.

In the comments, some users say the speed boost is not big for small files, and that /tmp is usually fast enough because Linux caches files in memory. Others point out you can mount /tmp as a RAM disk, and some Linux systems do this already. There are warnings that copying huge files into /dev/shm can fill up your RAM and cause problems for other programs. Some people say /dev/shm may not always be supported, so sticking to /tmp is safer. The author replies that /dev/shm is usually world-writable and simple to use. There are also stories about using RAM disks on old computers, and one person likes using Jupyter notebooks to keep data in memory. Most people agree: writing files to RAM is fast but risky, and you need to know the trade-offs.

Next, AlphaGenome is a new AI tool from DeepMind that helps scientists understand how DNA changes affect gene regulation and disease. AlphaGenome can look at very long DNA sequences—up to one million letters—and predict thousands of features like gene start and end points, splicing, and RNA levels in different cell types. It uses advanced neural networks, like convolutional layers and transformers, to find patterns and make precise predictions. The model is trained on large datasets from projects like ENCODE and GTEx.

Compared to older models, AlphaGenome can handle longer sequences, predict more gene regulation types, and score genetic variants faster. It is the first to predict RNA splicing directly from DNA, which helps study diseases caused by splicing problems. AlphaGenome outperforms other models in most tests. It can help study disease mechanisms, design synthetic DNA, and map important genome parts. For example, it has explained how a mutation can activate a cancer gene in leukemia. But it has limits: it struggles with distant DNA interactions and can’t be used for personal health predictions yet.

In the comments, some users are excited and see this as good progress, though others say bigger breakthroughs, like full cell simulations, are needed. Some mention similar work has been around for years, but agree AlphaGenome is a strong step. There is discussion about the challenge of moving from AI predictions to understanding which DNA changes actually cause disease. People also talk about DeepMind’s strong team and resources. Some debate if black-box AI models are enough, or if science needs more transparent models. Overall, the community welcomes AlphaGenome but hopes for even more powerful and transparent AI in biology, and sees its value as genome sequencing gets cheaper.

Moving on, Issen is a new AI-powered app to help people practice speaking foreign languages using voice conversations. The app aims to give a real-tutor feel at a lower cost. It uses AI to turn speech into text, understand it, and reply in the target language. Issen supports many languages and lets you adjust lesson speed, topics, and formality. It focuses on real conversations, not just games, to help you learn faster. It remembers new words and gives you practice with flashcards. The creators say it works best for people who already know some of the language. Making speech recognition work well with different accents and noise was a challenge. For quality, they combine several AI models and use different voices for each language.

Users can try Issen free for 20 minutes, then pay a monthly fee. The app is available on web, iOS, and Android. The team wants feedback and knows that some languages are better supported than others.

In the comments, many people like the focus on real conversations. Some say Issen feels more helpful than ChatGPT or Gemini for voice learning, but beginners can get lost because the AI does not guide or simplify enough. There are reports of the app giving long or hard sentences, ignoring struggles, or not correcting pronunciation well. Advanced users wish for more interesting topics, like news or debates. Some compare Issen to Duolingo, Memrise, or LingQ, saying those apps are too focused on streaks or not personal enough. There are also comments about pronunciation errors, bugs, and suggestions for features like better corrections, visuals, or integration with Anki. Some think the app should focus on fewer languages for quality, while others value support for rare languages. Overall, many agree Issen is promising, but needs better support for beginners, improved corrections, and more engaging content.

Next, we have a story about creative text layout scripts inspired by old manuscripts and special design needs. These scripts are for layout tools like InDesign. One script, “Same Sizer,” makes every word take up the same space, like a monospaced font but for words. “Wiggle Out” moves long words into the margin, curving them if needed. “Fill the Space” fills empty line space with marks or repeated letters, copying old text styles. “Hyphen Out” puts the second part of a hyphenated word outside the frame. “Hyphenator” shrinks the last part of a long word so it fits. “Last is First” previews the first word on the next line, a trick from Hebrew manuscripts. “Ext. Word & Letter” stretches the last letter or word to fill the line. “Variable Gradient” lets you fade between two styles or colors in a text block.

In the comments, one person wants to change the “Hyphenator” to fit more words by shrinking text, as students do with notes. Another thinks “Same Sizer” looks odd and suggests looking at Vietnamese calligraphy for better style. Someone asks why Hebrew manuscripts use these tricks so much. Some say these layout ideas are creative and could look good in titles or body text if done right. One person dislikes the style, joking it slows down reading, like the “Dotsies” font. Overall, commenters are split—some love the creativity, others find the styles hard to read or strange, and there is interest in the history and connection to old writing systems.

Now to software updates: Kea 3.0 is a new version of a DHCP server, and it is the first to get long-term support for three years. This means users get more stable updates and don’t have to upgrade often. Most of Kea’s “hook” plugins are now open source, except for two paid ones. The way Kea is installed has changed, so users should read the notes before upgrading. Security is better, but users must update passwords and protect remote management. Kea no longer needs a Control Agent for remote access; it now uses HTTP and HTTPS APIs. Client management is more flexible, which helps those moving from old ISC DHCP servers. The build system now uses Meson, making builds faster and easier. Database tools for MySQL and PostgreSQL are now separate, so you only install what you need. There are new guides and manuals to help with upgrading and using the new features.

In the comments, people explain that Kea is replacing the old ISC DHCP server, which is now end-of-life. Some discuss how firewall systems like pfSense and OPNsense are handling the switch to Kea. A few say the change has been messy, but recent updates have fixed bugs. OPNsense now uses Dnsmasq by default for DHCP, but Kea is also available. One user shares that Kea worked better than Dnsmasq for a big project with 20,000 devices. Some people didn’t know what Kea was and had to look it up, while others explain it is a modern DHCP server with strong IPv6 support. There are also memories of debates about other network tools like BIND and djbdns. Overall, comments show some confusion, some praise for Kea’s performance, and some worries about the switch, but most agree this is an important update for DHCP users.

Next up, the article says the web is missing a native way to safely and easily turn data into dynamic HTML, like all popular frameworks do. The author explains that a native DOM templating API could make web apps faster, safer, and easier to build by letting developers update pages with new data without writing lots of code or depending on big libraries. Today, every major framework—React, Vue, Svelte—has its own way to do templates, but the web itself has nothing standard. This means extra code for each project, slower sites, and more security risks.

The time is right to fix this, since the community now agrees on what good templating looks like—mostly using JavaScript template literals or JSX-style syntax. The author suggests a JavaScript-based API would be easiest to add, and could help build more complex features later. The article also explains how frameworks handle updates and says a mix of these ideas would work best for a native API. Previous attempts to add templating to the web failed, but now, lessons from frameworks show a clear path forward. A new API could help both vanilla JS developers and framework authors, making apps load faster and code safer.

In the comments, some developers agree that native templating is needed and would save CPU and bandwidth now wasted on big libraries. Others remember older technologies like XSLT and XUL, saying they had strong features but were too hard to use. Many debate what kind of API would help most—some want a built-in virtual DOM, others a more visual system, and some want flexible syntax from other languages. Some worry that any new standard will quickly get outdated, as needs change. There’s also talk about how features like <template> and <slot> are not reactive, so reactivity is still a hard problem. Some discuss React’s approach, differences in event handling, and how Web Components could benefit from native templating. Finally, some dream of a future where HTML, CSS, and JS are unified into one simple syntax.

Onto robotics, there’s an article about robots that can learn a new task just by watching it once. OpenAI has built a robot system that learns in simulation and then works in the real world. The robot’s vision is trained only with simulated images, using many different colors, backgrounds, and lighting. The main new idea is “one-shot imitation learning”—a person does the task one time in virtual reality, and the robot copies it from any starting point. The system uses two neural networks: one for vision and one for imitation. They train these with many examples, showing different ways to do tasks like stacking blocks. The imitation network uses “soft attention” to handle different numbers of blocks or steps. Noise is added to training, so the robot learns to recover from mistakes.

In the comments, some users note this work is from 2017 and wish for more recent robotics news. Others say they were excited at first, but then felt let down when they saw the date. There are jokes about robots folding laundry and how far we are from real household robots. Some discuss why startups avoid automating chores, and how hard tasks like folding laundry are for robots. A few talk about the robot’s old hardware, and whether we really need general intelligent robots now. There are also concerns about military use and links to more recent research, showing the field keeps moving.

Next, an article discusses how much slower random memory access is compared to sequential access when reading large arrays. The author wrote code in Rust to sum arrays two ways: first-to-last and random order. For small arrays, both are fast, since everything fits in the CPU cache. As arrays get bigger, random access becomes up to 8–16 times slower on some systems. When arrays are bigger than RAM, things slow down a lot, especially for random access. The author also tested memory-mapped files, but results were mostly the same, except on macOS. The main bottleneck is memory bandwidth, not CPU speed.

In the comments, one reader notes this is not true random access, since the index array is still linear and can be prefetched. Another says this is why arrays and linked lists perform differently—linked lists are even slower. Someone mentions the GUPS benchmark from high-performance computing, which measures random memory access. One person was surprised random access was only 4 times slower, not worse, and liked the analysis. Another shares a blog post but disagrees with using “time per element” as the main metric. Overall, the post gives real numbers for random vs. sequential access, and commenters add context from computer science and high-performance computing.

Now to browser automation: Magnitude is a new open-source framework that automates browsers using AI. It uses a “vision-first” method, working more like a human by looking at the page. Magnitude can handle complex tasks, like drag-and-drop or working with graphics-heavy sites. It is not just for testing; you can use it to collect data, connect apps without APIs, or build browser agents. Magnitude uses smart models to decide what to do, then acts by clicking or moving the mouse like a person. The suggested model is Claude Sonnet 4, but you can use Qwen, which is cheaper but less reliable. You get a lot of control, from high-level tasks to detailed actions, and can mix its actions with your own code.

In the comments, some people say Magnitude is easy to set up and works well for simple tasks, but worry about cost and reliability for big jobs. One user points out that, since every step can fail, long tasks may not finish often and could get expensive. Others ask if it’s better than older tools like Playwright, since using AI makes it slower and pricier. The makers say it can save time, especially for messy sites where old tools break. You can use cheaper AI models if needed. Some suggest just using AI to write scripts, but the team says scripts break when websites change, so their tool adjusts itself. There are also comments about working with graphics-heavy sites and a side discussion about tone.

Finally, Matrix v1.15 is out, bringing new features to the Matrix messaging protocol, especially for logging in, seeing room info, and using rich text in topics. The update adds OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication, making Matrix safer and closer to Matrix 2.0. There’s a new room summary API, so clients can show more room details before joining, and rooms can now have bold text, lists, and links in descriptions. Other technical changes include new endpoints, better security, more options for room properties, and many small fixes.

In the comments, many users wish Matrix would add features like Discord’s detailed permissions and voice channels. Some are disappointed, blaming funding and focus on enterprise needs. Matrix developers say the current focus is on organizations, not on competing with Discord, but Matrix does have detailed permissions using “power levels.” Some find this confusing and want simple role-based permissions. Others argue that people are just used to Discord’s way, but agree role-based permissions are easier. Some like that Matrix lets you run your own server and care about privacy, but note that most people just want something simple like Discord or WhatsApp. A few mention the official client Element used to be slow, though the new Element X is faster but missing features. Problems with bridging to IRC, heavy servers, and confusing encryption keys are also raised. Some users say Matrix is mostly used by privacy-focused people. There’s talk about Matrix’s focus on government and enterprise, and worries about funding. Still, some are hopeful that as Matrix grows, it will become a better choice for everyone.

That’s all for today’s episode. Thank you for listening to Hacker News Daily Podcast. We’ll see you tomorrow.
