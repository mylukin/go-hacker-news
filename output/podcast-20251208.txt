Hello everyone, this is the 2025-12-08 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have a packed show with stories about distributed systems, earthquakes, GPUs, VPNs on Kindles, North Korean fiber networks, big tech deals, AI hardware, coding agents, and tiny code demos. Let’s get started.

First, Jepsen has released a deep analysis of NATS JetStream 2.12.1, which is a popular system for sending and storing messages across clusters. Jepsen tested how well NATS JetStream keeps data safe during failures like power loss or file corruption. While NATS promises that messages are safe after you get an acknowledgment, Jepsen found this is not always true. If data files get damaged or partly deleted on just a few nodes, many messages can disappear—even if they were already acknowledged. The same happens if several nodes lose power at the same time: you can lose lots of recent messages, even though the system said they were saved.

The main reason is NATS’s “lazy fsync” policy. By default, it does not write messages to disk right away. It saves up messages and writes them every two minutes. If a crash happens before the next disk write, all recent messages can be lost. Some other systems, like MongoDB or Zookeeper, flush to disk before confirming a message is saved. NATS does let you change this, but it slows things down.

Jepsen also found that a single node crash, mixed with network delays, can cause “split-brain.” That’s when parts of the cluster disagree about what messages exist, which leads to more data loss.

An older NATS version had a bug where a crash could erase whole data streams. That was fixed, but Jepsen found other issues still open, where NATS loses data after certain faults. The article also points out that NATS cannot be always available and fully consistent, because of the CAP theorem. In reality, it behaves like other Raft-based systems: it works if a majority of nodes are up, but can lose data in rare cases.

The comments show many users are surprised and concerned about these data loss risks. Some thank Jepsen for clear testing and reporting. People note that users may not realize they need to change the disk flush setting to protect data, and that the docs should warn more clearly. Some say “lazy fsync” is common for speed, but users must know the risks. Others say no distributed system is perfect, and trade-offs between speed and safety are normal. There is discussion about how other systems like Kafka or etcd handle similar problems. People agree that strong defaults and clear warnings are very important. Some defend NATS, saying with careful setup, the risks can be managed. Others wish for safer settings out of the box. Overall, there is a mix of concern, respect for Jepsen, and a reminder that all distributed systems have complex trade-offs.

Next, a strong earthquake hit northern Japan late Monday night, with a magnitude of 7.5. The center was near Aomori Prefecture, about 54 kilometers deep. People in Hachinohe city felt strong shaking, and six people were hurt. Tsunami warnings were issued for parts of Iwate, Hokkaido, and Aomori. The largest tsunami was 70 centimeters at Kuji Port. The warning was lifted after three hours, and all was clear by the next morning.

The earthquake caused long-period ground motions, which can be dangerous for high-rise buildings because they shake for a long time. In Rokkasho, people in tall buildings had trouble standing. Officials warned that a much bigger “mega quake” could happen soon in the area. People were asked to check evacuation routes and supplies, and to stay alert for a week. Some towns ordered evacuations right after the quake.

Train lines, including the Shinkansen, stopped between Fukushima and Shin-Aomori while tracks were checked. Some highways and airports paused or checked service, but most traffic was normal by Tuesday. Nuclear power plants were checked and found safe. Treated water releases at Fukushima Daiichi were paused, but there was no danger.

The government quickly set up a crisis team and made rescue and relief a top priority. Experts said the quake was big and happened at a plate boundary. People were told to stay away from the coast.

On Hacker News, many were worried about aftershocks or a bigger quake. Some praised Japan’s warning systems and strict building rules, saying these saved lives. Others remembered the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, sharing concern for nuclear safety. Some talked about the impact on travel and business, and how Japanese cities prepare for disasters. There was relief that the tsunami was small, and stories of living through earthquakes in Japan. People also talked about how quickly trains and services stopped, showing Japan’s focus on safety. A few questioned if mega quake warnings cause too much fear, but others said it’s better to be safe.

Now, to GPU debugging. A new article explains how to build a real debugger for AMD GPUs, similar to those for CPUs. GPU debugging is hard because GPUs run many threads at once, and there are few tools for stopping and checking what’s going on.

The author started by talking directly to the GPU using low-level Linux libraries. They set up memory for code and commands, loaded compiled shader code, and sent commands in a special PM4 packet format. To make the GPU stop and let the CPU inspect things, they used TBA and TMA registers to set up a “trap handler.” This handler runs when the GPU hits a breakpoint. But writing to these registers is tricky, so the author used debugfs and set values for all possible VMIDs.

The trap handler saves the GPU’s state, signals the CPU, and waits for the CPU to say it can continue. The CPU can pause, read the state, and control the GPU. Restoring the state is complex, but the article shows how to do it step by step. For compiling real code, the author used RADV’s “null_winsys” mode, which lets you compile SPIR-V shaders without running them. The article also explains how to add real debugger features, like stepping, breakpoints, memory watch, and mapping code to source lines. There are plans to make variable names and types better, and maybe to work with Vulkan for easier debugging. Bonus code for walking GPU memory pages is included.

Comments are full of praise. Many say GPU debugging is a huge pain point and hope this becomes a real tool. People admire the author’s persistence, since AMD’s stack is very complex. Some ask if this could work on Nvidia or Intel GPUs, and discuss hardware support for debugging. There are warnings that this kind of work is risky and can crash your system, but it’s great for learning. Some wish GPU vendors made these features easier to use, and share stories about how hard it is to debug shaders today. Others ask about breakpoints or safety of trap handlers. Some wonder if this could become a plugin for existing tools, or discuss security risks. Overall, the tone is positive, with many thanking the author for such detailed knowledge.

Next, an article explains how to run Tailscale, a VPN tool, on a jailbroken Kindle. Jailbreaking removes Amazon’s software limits, letting you use custom apps, change screensavers, and read more ebook types. The process depends on your Kindle’s version and can be risky.

Tailscale is not required, but it makes using a jailbroken Kindle much better. With Tailscale, your Kindle gets a fixed IP address. You can connect using SSH, and send files to it with Taildrop, moving ebooks or documents without a USB cable.

To start, check your Kindle’s version and find the right jailbreak method. After jailbreaking, install a launcher and tools to run other apps. Then, add Tailscale by copying files, getting a key from Tailscale, and setting up where files should go. Once set up, you can manage files, install more apps, and even use a Bluetooth keyboard. The biggest benefit is sending files from any device straight to your Kindle.

On Hacker News, some people love the idea of running Tailscale on odd devices and making Kindles more open. Others share their own jailbreaking stories. Some warn about risks like bricking devices or losing access after updates. A few wish Amazon would make Kindles more open. Some say the process is too technical for most, but like having guides. Others talk about the ethics of jailbreaking, saying owners should have more control. Some worry about security with custom software. People also ask if it’s really worth the trouble, or if a different e-reader is better. The thread is split between tinkerers and those who want easier solutions, but many agree that opening up devices can be a lot of fun.

Switching gears, another article looks at how fiber optic cables are set up inside North Korea, using clues from reports, photos, and network tests. It started with a North Korean PowerPoint showing a fiber line across the country. There is little public information, but some outside sources help. In 2017, a Russian company connected a fiber cable to North Korea over the Friendship Bridge. Old reports say the first lines were built in the 1990s, joining major cities. North Korea’s “Kwangmyong” network, their national intranet, also uses fiber.

Maps and cell tower data suggest main fiber lines follow big roads and railways, mostly on the east coast. In some places, photos show utility boxes and paths along tracks, hinting at buried cables. Where the railway goes through mountains, it’s guessed the cables use highways instead. North Korea also gets internet from China, entering at Sinuiju. Tests show the Russian connection has low delay near the border, while the Chinese path takes longer. Servers are likely in Pyongyang, but it’s not clear.

The main lesson is that North Korea’s fiber network probably follows railways and highways, with connections from Russia and China, but many details are guesses.

Comments show people are impressed by the open source detective work. Others note the article relies on many assumptions, and things may have changed. Some wonder why North Korea invests in fiber if most citizens can’t access the global internet. Others add that a closed network is still useful for government and military. Some think the author should be careful sharing this research. There is also talk about cable tapping or protections. A few wish for more technical details, and some thank the author for sharing rare information.

Next, IBM will buy Confluent, the real-time data streaming company built on Apache Kafka, for $31 per share in cash. Confluent will keep its own brand inside IBM. The deal aims to help IBM and Confluent offer better tools for companies using data in the cloud and for AI. Confluent’s CEO says their mission will not change, and working with IBM will help their technology reach more users. IBM has bought open-source companies before, like Red Hat and HashiCorp. The deal could finish by mid-2026. Employees are told their jobs and pay will stay the same until the deal is done.

In the comments, many worry IBM will slow Confluent’s growth or make it less exciting. Some say when IBM bought Red Hat, things changed, and fear the same for Confluent. Others think Confluent’s technology will become harder or more expensive for small companies. Some say it’s a smart move for IBM, as streaming data is key for AI and modern business. Some are happy for the Confluent team, saying they deserve the reward. Others are cautious, remembering IBM has a mixed record with past tech buys. Some hope Confluent will build better tools with more resources. There is also talk about how this deal shows real-time data streaming is a big business now. Overall, the comments are split between worry and hope.

Now, let’s talk about Nvidia’s recent big profits. The article questions if their growth is as solid as it seems. Nvidia’s revenue is way up from selling AI chips, but there are worries: cash flow is lower than income, inventory has doubled, and it’s taking longer to get paid. Nvidia is betting big on its new chip, Blackwell.

There’s also talk of “circular funding.” Nvidia invests in OpenAI, OpenAI signs a huge cloud deal with Oracle, and Oracle buys billions of dollars of Nvidia chips. Some think this means Nvidia’s sales may not be as strong as they look. If Nvidia stopped investing, would the other deals still happen?

OpenAI is also trying to depend less on Nvidia. They are buying memory chips directly, hiring chip experts, and working with Broadcom on custom hardware. This could let OpenAI run AI on its own chips. There’s a suggestion that Oracle should buy Groq, a startup making faster, cheaper chips, to solve supply problems and help profits. But it’s unclear if Nvidia would allow this, as it could break the loop of deals.

The article finishes by saying all three companies—Nvidia, OpenAI, and Oracle—are tightly linked, but each is trying to get an edge. The future of AI hardware is very competitive.

In the comments, some agree Nvidia’s growth is risky and may not last if OpenAI or Oracle switch to new chips. Others think Nvidia’s tech lead is real and their chips will be in demand for years. Some are skeptical about the “circular funding” claims, saying these deals are common. Some worry about too much power in one company’s hands, while others say that’s how tech works. There are comments about how hard it is to make new chips, and how long it will take OpenAI or Groq to catch up. Someone points out that even if OpenAI uses its own chips, many others still need Nvidia hardware. Overall, readers are curious but cautious, watching to see if Nvidia can keep its lead as rivals appear.

Now, on to new AI coding tools. The article says these tools can make building software much cheaper and faster. The writer, with 20 years of experience, thinks 2026 will surprise many people because of these new AI agents.

Before, making software was slow, needed many people, and had big costs for things like tests, dashboards, and connecting services. Open source and the cloud helped a bit, but not much. Now, AI coding agents can do a big part of the work very quickly. For example, an AI can write hundreds of tests in hours, something that would take a person days. AI tools can turn business ideas into working APIs fast. Projects that took a month now take a week, with fewer people and less wasted time.

This does not mean fewer jobs, but more demand. Cheaper software means more people want software. Many businesses have old Excel sheets that could become apps if it was cheaper to build them. The writer thinks domain knowledge—knowing the business and technical choices—matters more than ever. Developers who know the business and use AI well can work much faster. Teams can be much smaller, making it easy to try ideas and start again quickly.

AI tools are getting better fast, but many developers are still unsure. Some say AI makes mistakes or can’t handle old code. The writer says these problems are going away fast, and that learning AI tools now will give a big advantage.

In the comments, many agree that AI tools make things faster, but real projects are still hard. Some worry AI can’t handle complex needs or messy code. Others say the biggest savings are for simple, new projects, but big companies may not see benefits soon. Some say even with AI, you need good planning. Others are excited, saying small teams can now do what big teams did before. Some warn there may soon be lots of low-quality apps. Some ask if the cost will really drop 90% everywhere or just for some work. Overall, there is hope and excitement, but also some doubt. Many agree AI will change software, but not everyone thinks it will be easy or fast for every company.

Next, a new startup called Nia, part of Y Combinator’s Summer 2025 group, wants to help AI coding agents by giving them more context about the codebase. Coding agents often make mistakes because they don’t understand the whole project or its history. Nia gives agents extra info, like how parts of the code are used, why changes were made, or what bugs were fixed. It connects to tools like GitHub, documentation, and bug trackers, and gives this info to coding agents in a way they can use.

Nia can scan big codebases, keep track of updates, and works with different languages. You can control what information is shared, and there is a focus on privacy.

On Hacker News, some like the idea and say coding agents need better context. Others are careful, worrying about security risks, especially with private code. Some say they tried similar tools, but AI still made silly mistakes. There are questions about how well Nia works with very large or messy codebases. Some are excited to try it, while others want more demos or case studies. Overall, people think this is a problem worth solving, but it will take more work to get it right.

Finally, an article talks about writing tiny code “demos” in GLSL, a graphics language. The author shares tricks from making four demos, each about 512 characters. The “Moonlight” demo uses a simple “1/distance” trick for glowing effects. The “Entrance 3” demo builds all shapes from cubes, uses real lighting, and has fixes for phone graphics drivers. The “Archipelago” demo creates endless islands with special noise formulas and domain warping. The “Cutie” demo builds a character from rounded shapes, using smooth min functions for blending and simple math for animation.

The author likes the small code size because it forces focus, helps finish projects, and turns code into art. The 512 character limit comes from Mastodon’s post size.

Comments are full of praise. Some ask how the author keeps the code so short, or how to learn these tricks. People share stories about making tiny shaders, and talk about the fun and frustration of fitting ideas into small spaces. Some discuss the beauty of small, well-made programs, and how constraints drive creativity. Others say more people should try making tiny demos as a way to learn graphics programming. There are also questions about math for isometric views and the “1/distance” trick. Overall, people agree that these tiny GLSL demos are both fun and impressive, and thank the author for sharing.

That’s all for today’s episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Thanks for listening, and see you next time.
