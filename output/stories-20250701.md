- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44437316)

Figma has announced that it is planning to go public and has filed official papers with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The company wants to list its Class A stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "FIG." 

The blog post says the number of shares and the price are not set yet, and the IPO will only happen if market conditions are good. Figma started in 2012 as a design tool but has grown into a platform for teams to work together on building digital products. The company says it uses AI and is focused on making design and development easier and more fun for teams of all sizes. Big banks like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs will help manage the IPO process. The post also includes legal notes explaining that this is not an offer to sell shares yet, and more details will come in the official prospectus.

In the Hacker News comments, some people are excited, saying Figma is a great tool that changed how teams design together. Others are cautious, wondering if going public will make the product worse, like what happened to other tools after IPOs. Some users worry about possible price increases or changes to free features after Figma becomes a public company. A few people mention Adobe’s past attempt to buy Figma and wonder if this IPO is a move to stay independent. There are questions about Figma’s future growth—can it keep adding enough new users, or is the market now crowded? Some commenters point out that Figma’s strong community and plugin system help it stand out. Others say investors may push Figma to focus more on profits, which could change the company’s culture or roadmap. There’s also talk about the design tool market as a whole and how Figma competes with Sketch, Adobe XD, and others. A few developers share tips for using Figma in engineering teams, saying it’s not just for designers. Lastly, some people are interested in the technical side of Figma, asking about its web-based architecture and how it handles so many users at once.

This article looks at how planting more street trees in Las Vegas can help reduce heat in the city, especially for people walking outside. The study uses detailed computer models to test different tree-planting strategies and measure their effect on air temperature, humidity, and how hot it feels for people.

The study tested five scenarios: current tree cover, more trees spread everywhere, and more trees only in areas where people are most at risk from heat. The models showed that adding trees can lower air temperature, but most of the cooling happens at night. During the day, the air temperature does not get much cooler, and sometimes can even be a bit warmer because of how trees interact with sunlight and wind.

The trees help most by giving shade. This shade can lower the "mean radiant temperature" (the heat people feel from the sun and hot surfaces) by up to 16°C, which makes walking outside much more comfortable. The study also found that the type of tree matters. Trees that transpire (release water) more, like Cherry trees, can cool the air more during the day, but they need more water, which is a problem in a desert city like Las Vegas.

The models also showed that more trees can increase humidity, but this did not make the heat feel worse because the shade and lower air temperatures helped more. The benefit of planting trees was bigger at night, as the ground releases less heat, helping people sleep better and reducing health risks.

In the comment section, some people pointed out that planting trees in deserts uses a lot of water, which is already scarce in Las Vegas. Others said that trees still make a big difference in how hot it feels, even if they do not lower the air temperature much. A few users noted that picking the right tree species is very important, so they give shade but do not use too much water. Some developers and urban planners were interested in how these findings could help design better city streets and public spaces. Others worried about maintenance costs and the fact that trees take years to grow big enough to help. There were also comments about using other cooling methods, like reflective surfaces or shade structures, instead of trees. Some people shared personal stories about how walking on tree-lined streets is much nicer than on streets without any trees. Overall, the discussion showed that while street trees are not a simple fix, they are an important part of making cities safer and more comfortable in hot climates.

- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44437758)

This website is about the Roman Roads Research Association, a group in England that studies and shares information about old Roman roads. They host many online talks about Roman roads, Roman history, and archaeology, and they invite people to join, send in photos, or attend lectures.

The group offers a program of free and paid online lectures with experts discussing topics like Roman road building, Roman Britain, ancient temples, and new discoveries found with modern tools like LiDAR. They also publish a yearly journal called Itinera, which first is for members only but later becomes free for everyone. The website is planning an update to make it better and easier to use. They encourage both members and non-members to send in good pictures of Roman roads for their records and website.

They have special events, like joining fundraising walks along Hadrian’s Wall to help with the Ukraine crisis. The group is excited when more people join as members, and they thank everyone for their support. Their website includes a big list (gazetteer) of Roman roads in Britain, with new research and updates from experts. They also work with other organizations to protect and show important road sites, for example, the Roman road at Holtye.

Much of their work is about sharing new findings, using new technology, and making research open to everyone. Many lectures are recorded and put on YouTube, and they keep adding new content. The group is open to people who want to write articles, share photos, or help with projects.

Hacker News commenters liked how much information is available on the site and the group’s effort to make talks and research open to the public. Some users shared their own interest in Roman roads and told stories about finding or walking on them. Others talked about how LiDAR and modern tools help find new Roman roads that people did not know about before. Some wondered how accurate the old maps are, or how much of the Roman road network is still hidden. A few people thought the website could be easier to use and welcomed the news about a new version coming soon.

There was praise for the group’s journal and for making it open access after some time. Some users said they wished there were similar groups in their own countries. Others asked about how to get involved, donate, or attend a talk from outside the UK. Some were surprised at how much is still being found and learned about Roman roads today. A few people shared links to other resources, books, or videos about Roman history. Overall, the comments showed a lot of support for this kind of open, community-led research.

## Code⇄GUI bidirectional editing via LSP

- 原文链接: [Code⇄GUI bidirectional editing via LSP](https://jamesbvaughan.com/bidirectional-editing/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44435716)

This article talks about a small project that lets you edit code and a GUI at the same time, using the Language Server Protocol (LSP). The author wanted to work on CAD projects using their favorite code editor, but also wanted to make quick changes in a graphical interface.

The main idea is simple: if you move an object in the GUI, the code changes right away; if you change the code, the GUI updates instantly. The author tried other code-based CAD tools, but none allowed real-time, two-way editing with their own editor of choice. Some tools, like Fusion 360, have limited features, while OpenSCAD only updates the GUI from code, not the other way around. Other apps, like Zoo, require their special editor, and Arcol is made for architects, not programmers.

To test if this idea works, the author built a proof-of-concept. They set up a small server that talks to the code editor through LSP and to a web GUI using WebSockets. This allowed both views to stay in sync. They shared the code online so others can try it.

What’s new here is not just editing in both directions, but doing it with the text editor you like best, such as Emacs or Neovim, with all your settings and tools. The author finds this very exciting, because it could help make better code-based CAD tools. Still, building a real, full-featured version would be a lot of work: you’d need to handle things like comments, pretty-printing, and making sure the editor and GUI don’t overwrite each other’s changes.

The author does not plan to keep working on this project for now but hopes others will be inspired to use LSP for creative projects. They think OpenSCAD, which already has an LSP server, could be a good place to test more ideas.

In the comments, some readers love the idea and say they have wanted this feature for years, especially for design or CAD work. Others point out the technical challenges, like keeping code and GUI in sync, handling conflicts, and making sure text formatting and comments are not lost. Some people worry that it might be hard to make this work well for big, complex files, or for languages that are hard to parse.

A few commenters share stories about using file watchers to reload GUIs, but say it’s not as smooth as real-time, two-way editing. Some suggest that the LSP approach could work for other tools, like music or data visualization editors. Others think that for many people, the built-in editors in these programs are “good enough,” but agree that power users want more control.

One person says this could help bridge the gap between programmers and designers, letting both groups work in the way they like best. Another notes that making a “perfect” sync system might be impossible, but even a simple version would be useful. Several readers ask about edge cases, like what happens if you edit two things at once, or if the code has errors.

Overall, many are excited by the demo, see lots of possible uses, and hope more tools will try this idea in the future.

## Feasibility study of a mission to Sedna - Nuclear propulsion and solar sailing

- 原文链接: [Feasibility study of a mission to Sedna - Nuclear propulsion and solar sailing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17732)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44434062)

This article looks at how we could send a spacecraft to Sedna, a faraway object in our Solar System, using new types of engines. The study compares two main ideas: a rocket powered by nuclear fusion and a spacecraft pushed by a big, thin sail that uses heat from the Sun.

The nuclear engine, called Direct Fusion Drive (DFD), would use special fuel and could give steady power for a long time. With this, the ship could slow down and enter orbit around Sedna. The solar sail would work differently. It would be coated with a material that bursts off when heated by the Sun, giving it a quick push. The sail would also use Jupiter's gravity to get more speed, but it could only fly by Sedna, not stop there. 

The study splits the mission into four steps: leaving Earth, speeding up, coasting through space, and finally meeting Sedna. The DFD rocket could reach Sedna in about 10 years, spending one and a half years burning fuel. The solar sail, with help from Jupiter, could get there faster—in about 7 years. Both ideas are much quicker than regular engines, which would need 30 years or more.

The authors also think about how much science gear the ship can carry, if it will have enough power far from the Sun, and how it will talk to Earth. They say a mission to Sedna should launch soon, because after 2076, Sedna will move even farther away from the Sun.

In the Hacker News comments, some people are excited about new ways to explore deep space and like the detailed numbers in the study. Others point out that fusion engines are still not ready to use in real life; they are more of a dream for now. Some say solar sails are simple and proven, but it is hard to control them so far from the Sun, where sunlight is weak. A few users ask if we can really build and launch a sail big enough for this job. There is debate about the cost—some think it is too expensive, while others say we need to try bold missions like this to keep learning. One person wonders if we should just wait for better tech, but another says waiting means missing our chance, since Sedna will be gone for centuries. Some users share ideas for other engine types, and a few talk about the science we could do at Sedna. Overall, people like the idea, but see big technical and money problems.

## Fakespot shuts down today after 9 years of detecting fake product reviews

- 原文链接: [Fakespot shuts down today after 9 years of detecting fake product reviews](https://blog.truestar.pro/fakespot-shuts-down/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44437712)

Fakespot, a tool that helped people spot fake product reviews online, shut down today after nine years. Mozilla, which bought Fakespot in 2023, has ended the service because it could not make it sustainable.

Fakespot began in 2016 when its founder, Saoud Khalifah, was tricked by fake Amazon reviews. Instead of just leaving a bad review, he built software to find fake ones. Fakespot used AI to look for strange patterns in reviews, such as similar wording or odd reviewer profiles, across big sites like Amazon, eBay, and Walmart. Studies using Fakespot found that almost half of Amazon’s top product reviews might be fake, and in some categories, like clothing and jewelry, up to 88% of reviews were not trustworthy.

As Fakespot grew, it raised millions in funding and was seen as a key tool for honest shopping. Mozilla added Fakespot’s tech to Firefox, making it easier for users to check reviews. Many thought this was a great move, as both companies cared about privacy and trust.

But in May 2025, Mozilla said it would stop Fakespot (and another service, Pocket) because it wanted to focus on Firefox’s main features and new AI tools. Mozilla could not make Fakespot work as a business, even though many people liked it. Now, people are worried that shopping online will be harder and less safe, as fake reviews are still a big problem.

Some users are looking for other tools, like ReviewMeta or The Review Index, but the market is still searching for a good, lasting solution. The article’s author says they are now building a new tool, TrueStar, to try to fill the gap left by Fakespot.

Many Hacker News commenters shared their thoughts. Some are very sad about Fakespot closing, saying it was one of the few tools that helped them trust online reviews. Others point out that fake reviews are getting smarter, and wonder if any tool can really keep up. A few people say they never fully trusted Fakespot’s results, as it sometimes marked real reviews as fake or missed obvious problems. Some think Mozilla made a mistake by shutting it down, while others understand that running these services costs money and is hard to keep up. There are also comments about how Amazon and other big sites do not do enough to fight fake reviews themselves. A few users hope new tools will come soon, but others are not sure if anything will be as good as Fakespot was. Some developers talk about making their own simple scripts to spot review spam, but agree it is a tough job. Overall, people feel online shopping is now a bit riskier and miss having a way to check if reviews are real.

## Show HN: Spegel, a Terminal Browser That Uses LLMs to Rewrite Webpages

- 原文链接: [Show HN: Spegel, a Terminal Browser That Uses LLMs to Rewrite Webpages](https://simedw.com/2025/06/23/introducing-spegel/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44433409)

Spegel is a new tool: a web browser for your terminal that uses AI (LLMs) to change webpages into simple markdown text. The creator built it as a weekend project, and it became better when Google launched a faster AI model. Spegel lets you set up your own prompts, so you can see websites in the way you want—like getting only the important parts of a recipe. You use a config file to choose different views, such as “just show me the steps and ingredients” for recipes. The browser grabs the HTML from the site, sends it to an AI with your prompt, and shows the clean result in your terminal. It uses the Textual library to display everything. The project is still new, so not everything works perfectly. For example, it only does GET requests, not POST, so you can’t use forms yet. The creator compares it to old browsers like Lynx, but says Spegel is not meant to replace them—just to experiment and make web pages easier to read in a terminal, without extra clutter from CSS and JavaScript. You can install Spegel with pip, run it with any website, and edit your config file to set up different ways to view pages.

In the comments, many people are excited about the idea of using AI to make the web easier to use in a terminal. Some say it could help people who want less distraction, or who use slow internet. Others worry about privacy, since your browsing is sent to an AI model. A few users mention that LLMs sometimes make mistakes or “hallucinate,” so the rewritten content might not always be accurate. Some compare Spegel to tools that summarize web pages, and ask if it could be used for other tasks, like translating or simplifying text for language learners. There are also comments about the technical side—people discuss the use of Textual, and whether the streaming markdown approach could break with certain websites. Some wish for more features, like support for logging in or filling forms. Others wonder if this could make the web more accessible to blind users, if combined with screen readers. A few remind everyone that some web content, like interactive apps or videos, won’t work in this format. Overall, the community thinks it’s a creative use of AI, and they look forward to seeing where it goes next.

## I built something that changed my friend group's social fabric

- 原文链接: [I built something that changed my friend group's social fabric](https://blog.danpetrolito.xyz/i-built-something-that-changed-my-friend-gro-social-fabric/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44403988)

This article is about a person who made a Discord bot to help their friend group stay connected and hang out online. The group had moved to different countries and found it hard to organize gaming sessions and chats, especially during COVID.

The main problem was that their group chat in Signal was full of messages, so game invites got lost. People missed out on joining games or didn’t know others were online. To fix this, the author built a Discord bot using Python and the discord.py library. The bot sends a notification in Discord when someone joins a voice channel. It only posts the message for a short time to avoid clutter, and also saves who joined and when in a database.

At first, not everyone liked the idea. Some friends thought it was helpful, others thought it was annoying or useless. Many didn’t want to install the Discord app on their phones. But after some time, even people who didn’t like it started to use it. One friend said it made it easy to drop in for a chat, not just for games. The bot became a kind of signal for everyone to hang out, just like calling friends in the old days.

The bot also kept data about how often people joined voice channels. Over the years, the group met up thousands of times online, and even busy new parents could join for a few minutes. The author now shares fun stats at the group’s Christmas party, showing who joined most and other trends.

Some plans for the future include adding achievements, tracking time spent, and even making a hardware device with lights to show which friends are online.

In the comments, some people really liked the idea and wanted to use it for their own friends. Others suggested using existing Discord features or bots, saying similar tools already exist but maybe not with the same custom stats. A few thought it was too many notifications or worried it could be annoying in bigger groups. Some praised the personal touch and how it helped friends feel closer, especially during tough times. Others liked the idea of the hardware device and asked for more details. A few discussed technical parts, like how to improve the bot or use other hosting solutions. Many agreed that small tools like this can have a big effect on social life, and some shared their own stories of building things for friends. Overall, people saw it as a fun, meaningful way to use code to bring people together.
