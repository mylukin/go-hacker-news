A small plane crashed in Gloucestershire because a 3D-printed plastic part failed. The accident report says the part was an air induction elbow, made of plastic, and it collapsed after getting too hot from the engine.

The part was bought at an air show in North America and used in a light aircraft called the Cozy Mk IV. On March 18, during landing, the pilot tried to add power, but the engine lost power because the 3D-printed part had softened and collapsed. The plane hit a landing aid system but, luckily, the only person on board only had minor injuries.

The Air Accidents Investigation Branch found that the 3D-printed part was made from the wrong kind of material. After the crash, the Light Aircraft Association said it would send out a safety alert about using 3D-printed parts in planes. The report explained that the part was installed as a modification to the fuel system but was not able to handle the engine's heat.

The main point is that 3D-printed parts, if made from unsuitable plastic, can melt or fail in high temperatures, which is dangerous in planes. Safety groups now plan to warn other pilots and inspectors about these risks.

Many people in the comments say this crash shows why material choice is critical for aircraft parts. Some point out that 3D printing is not always bad, but you have to use the right materials, like special heat-resistant plastics or metals. Others think 3D-printed parts should never be used in important systems on planes unless tested well.

Some users say this is a problem with homemade or experimental aircraft, where rules can be less strict. One comment explains that plastic parts close to engines will always be risky because engines get very hot. A few people defend 3D printing, saying it is safe if used correctly and with proper engineering checks.

Others share stories about similar problems in cars and machines, showing this is not just an aviation issue. Some also discuss how easy it is now to buy and install parts that have not been fully tested. Finally, a few commenters hope this accident will lead to better safety rules and more education for pilots who want to use 3D-printed parts.

## CUDA-L2: Surpassing cuBLAS Performance for Matrix Multiplication Through RL

- 原文链接: [CUDA-L2: Surpassing cuBLAS Performance for Matrix Multiplication Through RL](https://github.com/deepreinforce-ai/CUDA-L2)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46153058)

CUDA-L2 is a new system that uses AI and reinforcement learning to make matrix multiplication on GPUs faster than NVIDIA’s cuBLAS library. The project focuses on optimizing half-precision matrix multiplication (called HGEMM) for the A100 GPU, and claims to beat not only torch.matmul but also NVIDIA’s best closed-source libraries.

The main idea is to let large language models and reinforcement learning explore many ways to write CUDA kernels for matrix multiply, then pick the fastest ones. CUDA-L2 has tested its code on 1,000 different matrix sizes and shows clear speedup over cuBLAS in its benchmarks. The code is open source and includes tools to test, compare, and use these new kernels. The project uses NVIDIA’s CUTLASS library (version 4.2.1), and you must set some environment variables to get it running. You can run tests in two ways: offline (batch processing) or server mode (like handling real-time requests), and you can pick problem sizes and GPU IDs. If you need a matrix size not in their list, you can pad your matrix or ask the authors to add support.

CUDA-L2 only guarantees speedup on the A100 GPU for now, but the team plans to support more GPUs soon. The setup is for Python and needs PyTorch 2.6.0 or newer. The README and scripts help you run benchmarks and check correctness. For questions or requests, you can open a GitHub issue or email the authors.

In the Hacker News comments, some users are excited about beating cuBLAS, which is known to be very fast and hard to improve. They wonder if the speedup is real for all matrix sizes or just some special cases. Others ask if this approach can be used for other operations besides matrix multiply, or if it will work well on other GPUs. Some people are careful, saying that cuBLAS is so well-tuned by NVIDIA engineers that any speedup should be checked for correctness and not just raw speed. A few mention that reinforcement learning for code optimization is a hot topic now, and this project is a good example. There are also comments about how hard it is to set up CUDA projects, and some appreciate the clear instructions in the README. Some users hope for more open benchmarks and comparisons, while others worry that the gains may not hold for all real-world tasks. Overall, people like the progress but want to see more data and tests before trusting it fully.

## Multivox: Volumetric Display

- 原文链接: [Multivox: Volumetric Display](https://github.com/AncientJames/multivox)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46149813)

This article is about Multivox, a project for making your own volumetric display using spinning LED panels and a Raspberry Pi. The code and hardware plans are open source, and you can use them to build two different devices: Rotovox, which has better vertical resolution, and Vortex, which is brighter and refreshes faster.

The display works by spinning two LED panels around a vertical axis. A photodiode helps the software know the position as it spins. The whole system runs on a Raspberry Pi 4, and you use a Bluetooth gamepad (like an Xbox controller) to control the demos and games. Audio can go out over Bluetooth, but only at basic quality.

The software has two main parts: a driver that keeps track of the 3D pixels (or “voxels”) and updates the panels as they spin, and client code that creates the 3D content. You can run everything on the Pi inside the spinning device, or send 3D data from a PC over WiFi. There are little demo games and visualizations included, like a tesseract, fireworks, and a multiplayer light cycles game.

If you don’t have the hardware, there’s a simulator that shows the 3D effects on your computer using OpenGL. You can tweak many settings, like panel type, brightness, and how the scan works. The project uses CMake to build, and you can set it all up to start automatically when you turn on the Pi.

To use it, you start the driver, then run a demo or toy. The system has a simple menu system, called Multivox, that lets you pick which “cartridge” (demo or app) to run, and it saves a preview of each one.

In the Hacker News comments, many readers were impressed by the engineering and creativity. Some people loved the open source nature and the fact that all the plans and code are public. Others pointed out how hard it is to make these displays work well, especially keeping everything synced as the panels spin so fast. A few wondered about the safety of spinning parts at high speeds, and how to avoid accidents.

Some users liked the idea of using a Raspberry Pi for real-time tasks, but others worried about its limits—especially with the timing needed for the display. There was discussion about how the Bluetooth audio quality is low, and some suggested using a wired connection instead. Others were excited about the simulator, since most people can’t build the hardware themselves but still want to play with the 3D effects.

A few commenters remembered past projects like this, saying it’s fun to see the idea come back with modern parts and software. Some suggested improvements for the software, like making the menu easier to use or supporting more types of controllers. Overall, people were impressed with the project and happy to see such a detailed, hands-on open source build.

## Transparent leadership beats servant leadership

- 原文链接: [Transparent leadership beats servant leadership](https://entropicthoughts.com/transparent-leadership-beats-servant-leadership)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46147540)

This article compares two styles of leadership: servant leadership and what the author calls “transparent leadership.” The author managed a team and tried servant leadership but found problems with it.

Servant leadership is like “curling parenting,” where the leader tries to clear away all problems for their team. At first, this feels nice for the team, but it can make the leader tired and overworked. If the leader leaves, the team may not know how to solve problems on their own. Sometimes, the team becomes disconnected from the rest of the company and does not understand their purpose.

The author suggests transparent leadership as a better way. A transparent leader coaches and connects team members. They teach people how to solve problems and explain the company’s values. They help team members make their own decisions. Transparent leaders make sure everyone knows what is happening and why. They let team members grow by giving them more responsibility. The leader also trains others to take their place, making themselves less important over time.

If a leader becomes “useless” because the team works well without them, that is not bad. The mistake is when leaders, after this, create extra work or unnecessary rules to stay important. Instead, a good leader should return to hands-on work, like coding or technical tasks. This keeps their skills sharp and earns respect from the team. The manager becomes a strong extra worker, not just someone who pushes paper.

In the comments, many people agreed that servant leadership can cause problems by making teams too dependent on the leader. Some said they have seen this in real life, where teams fall apart when the leader leaves. Others liked the idea of transparent leadership and said it helps teams learn and grow stronger.

A few commenters argued that servant leadership can still work if the leader also teaches team members and does not just solve problems for them. Some pointed out that different teams may need different leadership styles. There were comments about how managers should not try to make themselves look busy by creating fake work.

Some people liked the idea of managers returning to technical work, but others warned that this does not fit every company. A few shared stories about good managers who made themselves “redundant” and moved on to new teams or projects. There was also a discussion about how good leadership means making the team strong, even if that means the leader is not always needed. Overall, most commenters liked the idea of transparency, teaching, and letting teams grow.

## Why are 38 percent of Stanford students saying they're disabled?

- 原文链接: [Why are 38 percent of Stanford students saying they're disabled?](https://reason.com/2025/12/04/why-are-38-percent-of-stanford-students-saying-theyre-disabled/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46150715)

Stanford says that 38 percent of its students are disabled, which is a much higher number than anyone expects for such a top school. The article explains that most of these students are claiming mental health or learning disabilities, like anxiety, depression, or ADHD, and many are getting special help for schoolwork, such as more time on tests.

The writer argues that this rise in reported disabilities is strange. Elite schools like Stanford usually only admit students who do very well in school and on tests. It seems unlikely that so many of these high achievers really have serious learning problems. The article shares that, at community colleges, where you’d expect to see more students with real learning struggles, only three or four percent get accommodations.

One reason for this jump may be that it’s now very easy to get extra help; students just need a doctor’s note. The culture around mental health and learning disabilities has also changed. Many young people today see these problems as part of their identity, not just as medical issues. Social media, especially TikTok, spreads broad ideas about what counts as a disability. For example, being bored or doodling in class is sometimes called a sign of ADHD online.

Because of this, many students may think normal struggles are signs of a disorder. The definition for things like ADHD has also become much wider, making it even easier to get a diagnosis. The article suggests that risk-aversion—being very afraid of failure—pushes students to look for reasons why they are struggling, instead of seeing hard work and stress as normal parts of college life. The writer warns that getting extra help when you don’t truly need it might hurt students in the long run, because they miss chances to grow and learn to handle tough situations.

In the Hacker News comments, some readers agree with the article. They say that the number is too high and that the system is being abused. A few people share that they know students who got diagnoses mainly to get better grades or more time on tests. Others point out that mental health problems are rising in general, so maybe the high number is not so strange.

Some users think the focus on labels and accommodations can be harmful, making students too dependent on extra help. Others argue that society is just better now at recognizing and supporting people with invisible disabilities, so more students are asking for help that was always needed. A few commenters say that elite schools are very stressful, and that could be causing more students to struggle, even if they did well before.

There are also voices saying that the system should be careful not to make it too easy or too hard to get help, because both real and fake cases exist. Some people call for better mental health support in general, rather than just academic accommodations. Finally, a few readers share personal stories about struggling with school, showing that the issue is complex and personal for many.

## It’s time to free JavaScript (2024)

- 原文链接: [It’s time to free JavaScript (2024)](https://javascript.tm/letter)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46145365)

This article says Oracle still owns the trademark for the word “JavaScript,” even though almost everyone uses the name freely, and Oracle never really used it for their own product. The author argues that the trademark is abandoned and should be released to the public.

The article explains that JavaScript, the language used on almost all websites, got its name from a deal between Netscape and Sun Microsystems in the 1990s. When Oracle bought Sun in 2009, they got the JavaScript trademark. Oracle keeps renewing the trademark, but the author says they do not use it for any real product, and most people at Oracle may not even know they own it.

The law says a trademark can be lost if it is not used in normal business, or if it becomes a generic term used by everyone. The article claims both are true here: Oracle has no main product called JavaScript, and the name is now used by millions of people to mean the general language, not something from Oracle.

The author points out that Oracle sometimes lists tools, like JET (a set of JavaScript libraries) or GraalVM (a virtual machine that can run JavaScript), but these are not main JavaScript products. Node.js, a popular JavaScript runtime, is not even connected to Oracle. The standards group that defines JavaScript, called TC39, uses the name ECMAScript instead because of the trademark problem. This leads to confusion, and even conferences have to use names like “JSConf” rather than “JavaScript Conference” to avoid legal risks.

The author says this causes trouble and confusion for the developer community. Oracle has not tried to stop others from using the name, likely because they know they would lose in court. Because of this, the trademark should be canceled and the name “JavaScript” should become public property. The letter calls for lawyers to help challenge Oracle’s ownership and encourages readers to sign the open letter.

In the comments, many people agree that the trademark is outdated and that Oracle is not using it in a meaningful way. Some say the name “JavaScript” is so common now that it is just like “email” or “internet”—no one company should own it. Others point out that the legal process to remove a trademark can be slow and expensive, but they support the idea.

A few commenters recall the history—how the name JavaScript was meant to ride on the popularity of Java, even though the two languages are quite different. Some people think it’s odd that we still call it JavaScript at all, and wish the name had been ECMAScript from the start, but they admit that “JavaScript” is what everyone knows.

Some worry about what would happen if Oracle suddenly tried to enforce the trademark, and say that the risk, even if small, is a problem for the community. Others argue that Oracle probably does not care, but legal teams always renew old trademarks just in case. A few commenters are not sure if the legal argument for abandonment is strong, but they agree that the name should belong to everyone.

One person notes that this is not the only tech trademark with confusing ownership, and that clearing up the status of JavaScript could help other open projects. Another commenter says that taking legal action is important, because simply asking Oracle to give up the trademark has not worked. Overall, most people support freeing the name “JavaScript” and want to see it become truly open.

## Hammersmith Bridge – Where did 25,000 vehicles go?

- 原文链接: [Hammersmith Bridge – Where did 25,000 vehicles go?](https://nickmaini.substack.com/p/hammersmith-bridge)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46151335)

The article talks about Hammersmith Bridge in London, which has been closed to cars for six years after engineers found it was unsafe. The story compares how fast big repairs happened in the past—like rebuilding Notre-Dame in Paris and replacing the bridge in the 1800s—to how slowly things move now.

The bridge once carried 25,000 vehicles each day. When it closed, people thought other roads would get too busy and local shops would lose money. But after six years, traffic did not get worse on nearby bridges—in fact, it got lighter. About 9,000 daily car journeys just vanished instead of shifting elsewhere. Many people switched to walking, cycling, or using public transport. Local spending actually increased in some areas, and air pollution dropped. The area’s economy changed: small local shops did well, but some stores that needed car customers from farther away lost business. 

Fixing the bridge to its old state is now estimated to cost £250 million and could take 10 years. Much of the cost today comes from safety rules, heritage laws, and the need for many experts and approvals—very different from Victorian times when building was faster, cheaper, and less safe for workers. There have been many ideas for what to do next: a new bridge, a toll road, rickshaws, or even letting a Chinese company rebuild it quickly (but with lower standards). The article says the real problem is not lack of money or skill, but that too many groups have the power to block plans, and nobody can force a decision.

One new idea is to use lightweight electric pods to move people across the bridge. This would cost only £10 million and fit within the bridge’s new weight limits. The pods would run every few minutes, carry people who cannot walk or cycle, and work with London’s ticket system. But local leaders refused to try this, so nothing changed.

The article says doing nothing is what is really happening. Some people are hurt by the closure—especially older, disabled, and low-income residents, plus shops needing car access. But for many, daily life has improved. The area is quieter, cleaner, and less crowded by cars. Emergency service times did not get worse. The writer says instead of spending huge sums to restore car traffic, the city should focus on better, cheaper transport for those who need help.

In the comment section, some people agree and say this is a good example of how cities can adapt when cars are removed. Others share that similar things happened in their towns: when a road or bridge closed, people found new ways to travel, and local life improved. Some readers point out that the drop in traffic is not just because of the bridge—it’s also from COVID, new bike lanes, and changes in work habits. A few worry about people who lost out, like older or disabled folks, and ask for solutions that help everyone. There’s debate about the high costs of UK infrastructure, with some blaming red tape and others saying safety is worth the price. Several commenters like the pod idea and wish the city would test it. Others are skeptical, saying that new tech often faces delays and hidden costs. Many agree that the bigger problem is government gridlock, not engineering or money. Some suggest that the bridge staying for bikes and walkers only could be a model for other cities, but others say it’s unfair to people who really need to drive. Overall, the discussion is lively, with people sharing local stories, questioning government decisions, and debating how best to balance history, cost, and daily needs.

## Django 6

- 原文链接: [Django 6](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/releases/6.0/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46153116)

Django 6.0 is the latest release of the popular Python web framework, arriving with new features, changes, and deprecations. This version only works with Python 3.12 and newer, and drops support for older Python versions and MariaDB 10.5.

Some big new features include built-in Content Security Policy (CSP) support to help stop cross-site scripting attacks, and template partials for reusing pieces of templates more easily. Django now has a simple background tasks system, letting you run code outside the main request—like sending emails—using a new @task decorator, though you still need an external worker to process jobs. Django also moved to Python’s modern email API, which makes handling emails easier and more robust.

Other improvements: Django admin uses new icons, password hashing is a bit stronger, and there are new tools for working with GIS, Postgres, and static files. Async paginator classes have been added, and there are more ways to customize migrations, models, and template features. The default auto-increment field for models is now BigAutoField. Some small details also changed, like how querystrings are built in templates and how test runners work.

Breaking changes: You need to update any third-party database backends or custom email code, since some APIs and method names changed. Django dropped support for some old features and settings, so if you use them, your project may break unless you update your code. For example, positional arguments in mail APIs are now deprecated, and some old email classes and functions are removed or replaced.

In the comments, many people like the new CSP support—some say it’s been missing for years and are happy it’s now standard. Others are excited about template partials, saying it will help make templates easier to manage and reduce code duplication. A few users wish the background tasks system was more like Celery, with a built-in worker, but others are glad for a lightweight option for simple jobs.

There’s some frustration about dropped support for older Pythons and MariaDB, but most users understand it helps Django move forward. Some complain that deprecating positional mail arguments will break their old code, while others say it’s better for clarity and safety. A few developers worry about third-party library compatibility but appreciate the clear upgrade guide.

People also discuss the new admin icons; some love the fresh look, while others prefer the old style. The password hasher change is seen as a good security move. Some power users point out subtle changes in GIS and Postgres features that will help special use cases.

Overall, the community feels Django 6.0 is a solid upgrade with helpful new features, though there’s the usual mix of excitement, caution, and a few grumbles about breaking changes. Most agree it’s a step forward, especially for security and template improvements.

## How elites could shape mass preferences as AI reduces persuasion costs

- 原文链接: [How elites could shape mass preferences as AI reduces persuasion costs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04047)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46145180)

This article talks about how people in power (elites) can use AI to change what the public thinks, because AI makes it cheaper and easier to persuade large groups. The author builds a model to show how these elites might act when they want to shape public opinion for their own goals.

In the past, elites could only use things like schools or newspapers to influence people, which was slow and expensive. Now, AI can make messages that are very targeted and convincing, and can do it at a much lower cost. This means elites can shape what people believe much more quickly and directly. The model in the article shows that if only one group is in power, they have a strong reason to push society to be more divided (polarized), because it helps them keep control. Better AI tools make this polarization happen even faster.

If there are two groups that take turns in power, things get more complex. Sometimes both groups try to make society "stick" in the middle, because it is harder for the other side to undo their changes. This can sometimes make opinions less divided, but it depends on the situation. The main point is that AI-driven persuasion changes polarization from being just a side effect of politics to something that can be used as a tool by those in charge. This could have big effects on how stable democracy is as AI gets better.

People in the comments had many different thoughts. Some are worried that AI could make it too easy for people in power to control everyone’s beliefs, leading to less real debate and more manipulation. Others point out that people have always tried to persuade and control, and AI is just a new tool—what matters is how we set rules and limits. A few say that people are not so easy to fool, and that strong opinions often come from real problems, not just from clever messaging. Some think we need new laws to stop abuse of AI in politics, while others believe that open AI tools could help the public fight back and keep information clear. There is also talk about how social media already made persuasion easier, but AI could take it to a new level. Overall, many agree this is an important problem, but they do not all agree on how dangerous it will be or what to do about it.
