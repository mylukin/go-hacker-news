Hello everyone, this is the 2025-10-19 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we bring you stories from the worlds of medicine, education, retro computing, aviation, open hardware, app development, scientific software, open source security, computer history, and even a new way to look at the world map. Let’s get started.

First, in an unusual event in the pharmaceutical industry, Novo Nordisk, a major drug company, lost patent protection for its best-selling drug semaglutide—sold as Ozempic and Wegovy—in Canada. The reason? They simply forgot to pay a small yearly fee. Because of this mistake, the door is now open for other companies to sell cheaper, generic versions in Canada years before they can in the United States. Sandoz, a generic drug maker, already plans to launch their version in 2026. In the US, the patent lasts until at least 2032. This error is even more shocking because Canada is the second biggest market for this drug, and many Americans cross the border to buy medicine there. Once a Canadian patent lapses like this, the law says it cannot be brought back.

Hacker News users are amazed that such a big and rich company could forget such a simple, but important, payment—especially for a drug that makes so much money. Some wonder if Novo Nordisk let the patent expire on purpose, maybe because of Canada’s drug price controls. Others point out that the patent system is so complex, and a small payment mistake can cost billions. Many think this is good for Canadian patients because they will get cheaper medicine sooner, and some predict more Americans will seek drugs from Canada. There are jokes about this being the “cheapest billion-dollar mistake ever.” Some hope other companies will learn from this, while others discuss how aggressive the generic drug industry is, always watching for such mistakes. Many agree Novo Nordisk will now look hard at its patent management.

Next, we have some practical advice for students, shared by Andrej Karpathy, a well-known AI researcher. He talks about how to do well in university courses. His main points: don’t pull all-nighters—sleep is key for memory and problem-solving. Start studying early, go to review sessions, and make a plan by writing down everything you need to know. Look at old tests to know what to expect. Practice by writing things from memory, not just reading. Study alone first, then join group study for the final review—teaching others helps you too. Visit your professor during office hours, even if you have to invent a question. For math, doing exercises is more effective than just reading. Make a cheat sheet, even if you can’t use it—it helps you remember. Study in a quiet place, and before the test, eat and drink coffee about two hours ahead. On test day, use a pencil to erase mistakes, skim all questions first, do the easy ones, and never leave early—use all your time to check your work.

But Karpathy says don’t focus only on grades. Real-world experience, coding projects, internships, and strong letters from professors are even more important. In the comments, many agree sleep is more valuable than late-night study, and share stories of solving problems after a good rest. Looking at old tests and making cheat sheets are popular tips. Some like group study, while others find it distracting. Many note that grades matter mainly for the first job; after that, projects and experience are what count. Some wish they’d learned the value of real-world work and networking earlier.

Now, let’s talk about retro computing. Dosbian 3.0 is a new operating system for Raspberry Pi that boots straight into DOSBox, turning your Pi into an old-school DOS computer. The latest version supports more Raspberry Pi models and uses DOSBox Staging for better speed, especially on Pi 5 and 500. You can run classic DOS software, Windows 3.1, 95, and 98, play games, use ScummVM, and create virtual floppy disks or hard drives. There’s a GUI tool for mounting disks, but you need to add your own games or operating systems. Dosbian is donationware, works with Pi 3, 4, 400, 5, and 500, and comes with online guides.

In the comments, users thank the developer and share tips. Some help with USB drive issues, others want more support for different DOSBox versions or special hardware. Some say Dosbian is buggy or slow, while others have no problems. Feature requests include Bluetooth, network, and serial support. Some wish it worked on older Pi models, or supported other boards like Orange Pi. A few suggest other emulators for better Windows performance. Overall, users like Dosbian for making retro computing easy, but hope for more features and better hardware support.

In aviation news, a United Airlines 737 MAX was hit by a falling object, possibly space debris, while flying at 36,000 feet over Colorado. The object damaged the windshield and frame, slightly injuring one pilot, but the plane landed safely in Salt Lake City. The crew handled the incident well, descending to a safer altitude and getting passengers to their destination on another plane. The airline and FAA have not commented yet.

Commenters praise the crew for staying calm. Some joke about pilots needing helmets, and wonder how the pilot was cut if the windshield was not fully broken. There’s speculation about what hit the plane—space junk, a meteor, or maybe a balloon payload. Some link to photos and news stories, while others want more answers from the airline and regulators. Most people are amazed at how rare such an event is, and agree the crew did a great job.

Moving on to open hardware, there’s a new website for comparing single board computers (SBCs) like Raspberry Pi. You can search for boards by name, maker, memory, or processor, then compare up to three side by side. The tool shows specs, speed tests, and real-world performance, making it easy to find the right board for your project. The site is simple to use, with guides and popular boards ready for comparison.

Users like having a single place to compare SBCs, saying it’s helpful for both beginners and experts. Some wish for more info on software support and operating systems, or features like pricing and availability. Others stress the importance of power use and long-term reliability. One person suggests adding user reviews. Most people find the tool useful and hope it adds even more features.

Next, we have a story about a young developer, just 18 years old, who made their first iOS app called Recode: Screen Time Control. The app helps people block distracting apps on their iPhones. To unlock blocked apps, you must scan a QR code or barcode, making it harder to cheat and easier to stay focused. The developer built this because they struggled with phone addiction and found existing tools too easy to bypass. The app is free to try, with a paid version for more features, is small, and collects no data.

Users praise the developer for the clever QR code idea, saying it adds real friction for those trying to limit screen time. Some worry people will just keep the QR code nearby, and suggest more ways to unlock apps or features for parents. Others talk about how hard it is to block yourself from phone use, and some wish Apple allowed even deeper blocking. There’s interest in Android and desktop versions. Many share their own struggles with phone use and say they might try the app. Overall, people are impressed by both the idea and the developer’s age.

In scientific computing, GNU Octave, the free language similar to Matlab, now runs in your web browser thanks to JupyterLite and a new Xeus-Octave kernel. This means you can write and run Octave code anywhere, with no install. The team had to overcome big technical challenges to get Octave, which relies on Fortran, working in WebAssembly. They used special tools and even patched LLVM to make it all work. The browser version lacks a GUI and some features, but you can try it online now. The team wants to add more package support in the future.

Hacker News users are excited, saying this will help students and those who can’t install software. Many recall using Octave or Matlab in school. Some talk about the technical side, and are impressed by the cross-compiling work. Others wonder about browser speed and which features are supported, especially for plotting and packages. Some like that there’s no need to set up servers or deal with installs. There are requests for better package support and easier ways to share work. Most agree this is a big step for open science and education.

Now to open source security. The article discusses the XZ backdoor found earlier in 2024 and asks if better Git and Debian packaging practices could have caught it. The writer explains how Debian imports and checks software, and what tools can help with audits. The XZ backdoor was hidden in test files and build scripts, and was discovered by chance when someone noticed SSH was slower—not through any audit. The article shows how to check packages with tools like debsnap, uscan, and diffoscope, and how to review package history. But even with all this, the backdoor was so well hidden that it probably wouldn’t have been found without luck and expert eyes. The writer suggests Debian should make workflows more consistent, require more code reviews, and develop better tools.

In the comments, some agree that stronger policies and consistent workflows would help, while others say no system can stop a clever attacker. Some suggest moving away from complex build systems, or requiring Git for all packages. But most agree open source is still better than closed, because anyone can check for problems. Many thank Andres Freund for catching the XZ issue, and agree the community must keep improving security.

Let’s turn to computer history. The story of Tommy Flowers, a British engineer, is finally being told. Flowers built Colossus, the world’s first digital electronic computer, at Bletchley Park during World War II. While Alan Turing is famous for breaking the Enigma code, Flowers tackled the even harder Lorenz cipher. He built Colossus using thousands of vacuum tubes, finishing the machine in less than a year. Colossus helped the Allies read Hitler’s top messages. After the war, the machines were destroyed and Flowers’ work stayed secret for decades. Only later did historians uncover his role.

Many readers are surprised to learn about Flowers and his huge contribution. Some point out that history often forgets people from working-class backgrounds, or those who do practical work. Others discuss how government secrecy kept Flowers from getting credit, while American inventors became famous. There is praise for his technical skill, and debates about Colossus’s influence on later computers. Some share stories about visiting Bletchley Park and seeing the rebuilt Colossus. There’s also discussion about the many women who worked at Bletchley, and how teamwork, not just individual genius, won the war. Many feel Flowers deserves to be much better known.

Finally, we look at the world in a new way—with the Spilhaus Projection, a special map that puts the oceans at the center. Most maps focus on land, but this one shows the world’s oceans as one big, connected space, with Antarctica in the middle and the continents around the edge. The map was created by Dr. Spilhaus, an inventor and scientist. It reminds us that 71% of the Earth is water, and all the seas are linked. The map uses two triangles to show the Bering Strait, making it clear how close the oceans are.

Commenters thank the author for sharing the map, and some share memories of Dr. Spilhaus as a teacher and comic strip creator. There are ideas for what a map would look like if people could only travel by land, and a small debate about the words used to describe the map. Overall, people find the Spilhaus Projection a fresh way to think about our planet’s water.

That’s all for today’s episode. We hope you enjoyed these stories from Hacker News. Thank you for listening, and see you next time.
