- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45637744)

Novo Nordisk, a big drug company, lost patent protection for its important drug semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy) in Canada by forgetting to pay a small yearly fee. The article explains how this mistake could let other companies sell cheaper, generic versions of the drug in Canada years before they can in the US. In the world of generic drugs, companies watch for errors like this so they can copy drugs as soon as possible. Sandoz, a generic drug company, plans to launch their own version in Canada in 2026 because Novo Nordisk’s patent lapsed. The article describes how strange it is for a large company to overlook such a simple but important payment, especially for a drug that makes a lot of money. In the US, semaglutide is protected by patent until at least 2032, but now Canada’s market will be open to generics much sooner. The article points out that the Canadian market for semaglutide is very large—second only to the US—and some of this is probably due to people crossing the border for cheaper medicine. The author found proof that Novo Nordisk did have a Canadian patent, but let it expire by not paying the fee in time. Once a Canadian patent lapses like this, the law says it cannot be brought back.

In the top Hacker News comments, some people are shocked that a big company could make such a simple, expensive mistake. Others wonder if it was really an accident, or if Novo Nordisk decided not to pay on purpose because of Canadian price controls. A few comment that patent systems are overly complex, and missing a small payment can cost millions. Some users think this is good for Canadian patients, since it means cheaper drugs will come sooner. Others point out that US consumers may now try even harder to buy medicine from Canada. There are also jokes about how this was the “cheapest billion-dollar mistake ever.” Some wonder if other companies will learn from this and be more careful in the future. A few discuss how the generic drug business is very aggressive and always looking for these kinds of openings. Finally, some think this will cause Novo Nordisk to review its internal processes for handling patents and fees.

## Doing well in your courses: Andrej's advice for success (2013)

- 原文链接: [Doing well in your courses: Andrej's advice for success (2013)](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/advice.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45635533)

This article shares advice from Andrej Karpathy about how to do well in university courses. He talks about study habits, test strategies, and what really matters for your future.

Andrej says that pulling all-nighters is not helpful; sleep is important for memory and problem-solving. He suggests starting to study for tests early, so your brain has more nights to remember new things. Going to tutorials or review sessions is useful, even if they are boring, because they make you think about the material. When preparing for tests, write down everything you need to learn and make a plan. Look at old tests from your professor to understand what kinds of questions will come up. Andrej warns that understanding something while reading is not the same as being able to write it yourself, so practice by closing the book and writing things from memory. Study alone at first, but near the end, work with others—teaching weaker students helps you learn too. Visit your professor during office hours, even if you have to invent a question; sometimes they give helpful hints. For math, doing exercises is better than just reading. Make a cheat sheet, even if you cannot bring it to the exam; writing it helps you remember. Study in quiet places like libraries. On test day, eat and drink coffee about two hours before—never right before the test. Study hard just before the test to use your short-term memory.

During the test, use pencil so you can erase mistakes. Skim all questions quickly, and do the easy ones first. Be neat, box your answers, and never leave the test early—use all your time to check your work. If stuck, write notes for the marker to show what you know. If there are only a few minutes left, check all your answers instead of trying a hard question. Andrej’s final advice is not to focus only on grades. Good grades are fine, but real-world experience is more important. Work on real coding projects, get internships, do research, and build things outside of class. Letters from professors about your motivation will help more than grades alone.

In the comments, some people agreed that sleep was more valuable than late-night studying, sharing their own stories of solving problems after rest. Others liked the advice about looking at old tests and not relying only on reading textbooks. A few said that studying in groups helped them catch mistakes, while some felt group study was distracting. Several readers pointed out that grades matter more for first jobs, but after that, projects and experience matter most. Some people thought visiting professors for hints was a bit unfair, but others said building relationships with teachers is smart and normal. One commenter liked the idea of making cheat sheets for memory, even if not allowed in the exam. Others said they regretted leaving tests early and losing easy marks. Some disagreed about “studying right before the test,” saying it made them too nervous, while others found it helped. Many users agreed that real-world projects, internships, and open-source work opened more doors than just high grades. Lastly, a few wished they had understood the value of experience and networking earlier in their studies.

## Airliner hit by possible space debris

- 原文链接: [Airliner hit by possible space debris](https://avbrief.com/united-max-hit-by-falling-object-at-36000-feet/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45636285)

A United Airlines 737 MAX was hit by a falling object, possibly space debris, while flying at 36,000 feet over Colorado. The object damaged the windshield and frame, and one pilot got small cuts on his arm, but the plane landed safely in Salt Lake City.

The captain said the object might be “space debris,” which means it could have come from a rocket, satellite, or even a meteorite. This kind of event is very rare, and it might be the first time it has happened to a passenger plane. The plane was flying from Denver to Los Angeles when it happened. Only one layer of the windshield was damaged, so the cabin did not lose pressure. The crew decided to descend from 36,000 to 26,000 feet to make things safer for the rest of the flight. There were about 130 passengers on board, and they finished their trip on another plane. The airline and the FAA have not made any public comments yet.

One commenter praised the flight crew for staying calm and professional. Another person joked that pilots should start wearing helmets, and wondered how the pilot’s arm was hurt if the windshield did not break all the way. Someone else shared a link to more photos of the damage. Another commenter blamed “Elon,” hinting at Starlink satellites falling to Earth, and linked to an article about satellites re-entering the atmosphere. One person suggested the object could have been a balloon payload instead of space junk or a meteor. People in the comments seem both worried and amazed by how rare this event is, but most agree the crew handled it very well. Some are curious about what really hit the plane, while others are joking or making light of the situation. A few want more answers from the airline and the FAA about how such things can happen.

## Show HN: 18yo first iOS app: blocks distracting apps and unlocks with QR/barcode

- 原文链接: [Show HN: 18yo first iOS app: blocks distracting apps and unlocks with QR/barcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/recode-screen-time-control/id6752352978)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45638188)

This post is about an 18-year-old developer who made their first iOS app called Recode: Screen Time Control, which helps people block distracting apps on their phones. To unlock blocked apps, you must scan a QR code or barcode, making it harder to cheat and easier to stay focused.

The creator made this app because they found themselves spending too much time on their phone, scrolling endlessly, and not getting much done. Other screen time tools were too easy to bypass, so they wanted something stronger. With Recode, users choose which apps to block and set a QR or barcode—maybe one at home or in another room—as the only way to unlock them. The idea is that if you want to use those blocked apps, you have to physically go to the code and scan it, adding real friction. This makes it much harder to just “turn off” the blocker when you feel tempted. Over time, the creator says this helped them focus more, feel less tired at night, and be more productive.

The app is free to try, with a paid version for more features. It’s small (2.6 MB), collects no data, and works on iPhones with iOS 17.6 or newer. The developer says privacy is important, so no personal data is collected. The app is meant for anyone who wants help fighting phone addiction and creating better habits.

In the comments, many people praise the young developer for building something useful. Some say the QR code idea is smart because it adds a real barrier, unlike most blockers that are easy to turn off. Others wonder if people will just print the QR code and keep it next to them, making the block less effective. There are suggestions to improve the app, like adding more ways to unlock apps or making it work for parents who want to limit their kids’ screen time.

A few users talk about how hard it is to really block yourself from using your phone, and say that most solutions can be worked around if someone is determined. Some wish Apple would let developers block apps even more deeply, but note that Apple’s rules sometimes make this hard. Others ask about Android versions, or if something like this could be built for computers. Some users share their own struggles with phone addiction and say they might try the app.

Overall, people are impressed with the idea and the young age of the developer. There’s a mix of hope that this tool can help people focus, and healthy doubt about whether any app can really beat temptation if someone wants to cheat. Many agree that making distractions harder to reach, even just a little, can really help.

## GNU Octave Meets JupyterLite: Compute Anywhere, Anytime

- 原文链接: [GNU Octave Meets JupyterLite: Compute Anywhere, Anytime](https://blog.jupyter.org/gnu-octave-meets-jupyterlite-compute-anywhere-anytime-8b033afbbcdc)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45635069)

This article explains how GNU Octave, a free language for scientific computing and running Matlab code, now works in JupyterLite, which runs completely in your web browser. You can now write and run Octave code anywhere, without installing anything on your computer.

The main update is the new Xeus-Octave kernel for JupyterLite, which lets you use Octave in the browser thanks to WebAssembly. Bringing Octave to the web was not easy. The team had to cross-compile Octave, which uses a lot of Fortran code, to WebAssembly. They used special tools like LLVM Flang and Emscripten for this job. Octave also needs math libraries like BLAS and LAPACK. While OpenBLAS was first tried, Netlib LAPACK worked better for the build. A big problem came from Fortran’s “common blocks,” which WebAssembly did not support because of missing features in LLVM. To fix this, the team patched LLVM to make common blocks look like weak symbols, allowing the build to finish. They hope the next LLVM release will support this properly. They also had to disable Octave’s graphical user interface and make other small changes for the browser version. Once Octave worked with WebAssembly, adding it to JupyterLite was just a matter of packaging. You can try Xeus-Octave in JupyterLite right now online. The team wants to make it even better by supporting more Octave packages and making them easy to install. Many people and projects helped, like Emscripten-forge, JupyterLite, and the Xeus team.

In the Hacker News comments, many users are excited about running Octave in the browser. Some say this will help students and people who cannot install software on their computers. Others remember using Octave or Matlab in school, and think this is a great way to learn. A few users talk about the technical work needed to get Fortran and Octave running in WebAssembly, and they are impressed by the effort. Some wonder about the performance compared to native Octave or Matlab, and if it will be fast enough for big problems. There are questions about which Octave features work in the browser and which do not, especially for plotting or using extra packages. A few commenters like that you do not need to set up servers or deal with complicated installs. Some discuss possible issues with saving files or sharing code between local and browser versions. Others hope that more scientific tools will come to the browser, making it easier for everyone to try coding. There is also praise for the open-source work and for making scientific software more accessible. Some users suggest improvements, like better package support or easier ways to share work. Overall, most people see this as a big step for education and science on the web.

## Could the XZ backdoor been detected with better Git/Deb packaging practices?

- 原文链接: [Could the XZ backdoor been detected with better Git/Deb packaging practices?](https://optimizedbyotto.com/post/xz-backdoor-debian-git-detection/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45636116)

The article is about the XZ backdoor found in 2024, and asks if better Git and Debian packaging practices could have helped catch it. The writer explains how Debian imports software, how packages are checked, and what tools can be used for audits.

The XZ backdoor was hidden in two test files and a build script, which together put a backdoor into the final software. The discovery happened because someone noticed a slowdown in SSH, not because of any packaging audit. The article shows, step by step, how to download Debian source packages, check their signatures, and compare them with the original upstream sources using tools like debsnap, uscan, and diffoscope. It also explains how to review package history in git, check for differences between what’s in git and what’s actually in Debian, and even how to create synthetic git repositories from Debian source packages if the real git history doesn’t exist.

The writer points out that, although these tools help, the XZ backdoor was so well hidden that even careful use of Git and Debian best practices probably wouldn’t have found it. The attacker used normal-looking test files and build scripts common in many projects. Unless someone was very experienced and checked tiny details—like a version number being higher than usual—it was almost impossible to spot. The article says that Debian’s current policies are not strict, and different developers use different workflows, making audits harder. It suggests Debian should make workflows more consistent and use more code reviews.

Debian also lacks some tools to automatically check if the source packages match the real upstream code or if anything strange has been added. The writer warns that, because of these gaps, there could be other backdoors hiding in Debian packages now. More audits and better tools are needed to improve trust and security.

In the comments, some people agree that stronger policies and standard workflows would help. Others say that no amount of process can fully protect against such a clever attack, and that open source depends on trust and careful review, not just tools. Some suggest that moving away from complicated build systems like Autotools could lower risk. There are calls to make all package changes go through code review and for Debian to require git for all packages. But a few remind everyone that even with all this, open source is still better than closed source, since at least anyone can try to check for problems.

A few commenters admit that they would not have spotted the XZ backdoor either, even with perfect tools. Some are worried about supply chain attacks in general, especially as packages become more complex and have more dependencies. Others think that investing in better reproducible builds and automated checks could help. But everyone agrees that credit goes to Andres Freund for catching the problem, and that the open source community must keep improving its security practices.

## The working-class hero of Bletchley Park you didn't see in the movies

- 原文链接: [The working-class hero of Bletchley Park you didn't see in the movies](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/12/move-over-alan-turing-meet-the-working-class-hero-of-bletchley-park-you-didnt-see-in-the-movies)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45557596)

This article tells the story of Tommy Flowers, a British engineer who built Colossus, the first digital electronic computer, at Bletchley Park during World War II. While most people know Alan Turing as the famous codebreaker, the article shows how Flowers, from a working-class background, played a key but lesser-known role in breaking Nazi codes.

Turing helped solve the Enigma code and designed the Bombe machine, but the even tougher Lorenz cipher—used for Hitler’s top messages—needed something new. Flowers, who worked for the Post Office and had no university degree, was asked to help when an earlier machine called Heath Robinson was too slow and unreliable. Drawing on his experience with electronic switches, Flowers designed Colossus, which used thousands of vacuum tubes to perform fast calculations. People doubted his ideas, thinking valves would fail, but Flowers knew they could work if used right.

Flowers’ team worked long hours, building Colossus in less than a year. The machine was huge, filled a room, and allowed codebreakers to quickly find the settings needed to read secret German messages. By the end of the war, ten Colossus machines ran at Bletchley Park, helping the Allies win. After the war, most Colossi were destroyed and Flowers’ work stayed secret for decades. Later, others like Turing and American computer pioneers got most of the credit for inventing computers, while Flowers was left out and even doubted by his own managers.

Only much later was his role made public, thanks to historians and family. Flowers himself stayed humble, saying big discoveries are rarely made by one person alone. His niece remembers him as kind and proud of his working-class roots, and now a mural and foundation honor his legacy.

In the Hacker News comments, many readers were surprised to learn about Tommy Flowers and how much he contributed. Some said they had only heard about Turing and Enigma in school or from movies. Others pointed out that history often leaves out people from less privileged backgrounds, especially if they do practical work instead of theory. A few commenters discussed how secrecy laws kept Flowers from getting recognition or money, while American inventors became famous.

Several readers praised Flowers’ technical skills, noting that building a reliable machine with so many vacuum tubes was incredibly difficult at the time. Some debated how much influence Colossus had on later computers, since its existence was kept secret for so long. Others shared personal stories about visiting Bletchley Park and seeing the rebuilt Colossus, saying it was inspiring. There was also discussion about how many people, especially women, worked at Bletchley Park, and how teamwork—not just individual genius—helped win the war. In the end, many agreed that Tommy Flowers deserves to be better known as a true hero of computing history.

## The Spilhaus Projection: A world map according to fish

- 原文链接: [The Spilhaus Projection: A world map according to fish](https://southernwoodenboatsailing.com/news/the-spilhaus-projection-a-world-map-according-to-fish)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45556911)

The article talks about the Spilhaus Projection, a special world map that shows the oceans as one big, connected space. Most maps focus on land, but this map puts the oceans in the center and shows Antarctica in the middle, breaking up Asia and the Americas around the edges. The Spilhaus Projection was made by Dr. Spilhaus, who was an inventor and scientist known for many things, including weather balloons and city designs. This map helps people see how much of the Earth is water—about 71%—and connects all the seas into one body. The map uses two triangles to show the same place, the Bering Strait, which reminds us that the world’s oceans are all linked. The article says most maps ignore the oceans, but this one makes them important, which could help us think differently about our planet.

In the comments, some readers thank the author for sharing the map and say it’s a great idea. One person remembers Dr. Spilhaus as a teacher and comic strip creator, still hoping to see his ideas for domed cities. Another person wonders what kind of map would exist if people could only travel on land or a little way into the sea—they think the map would look very different and miss out many islands. The article’s author replies, suggesting this could be a good topic for another story. Someone else calls the map idea logical but surprising. There’s also a small debate about the use of the word “bits” to describe the oceans, with one person asking for better vocabulary and another saying it fits the article’s style. Overall, people find the map interesting and like the fresh point of view it gives about the world’s water.
