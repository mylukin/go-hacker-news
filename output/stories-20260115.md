## Apple is fighting for TSMC capacity as Nvidia takes center stage

- 原文链接: [Apple is fighting for TSMC capacity as Nvidia takes center stage](https://www.culpium.com/p/exclusiveapple-is-fighting-for-tsmc)

Apple and Nvidia are now both big customers of TSMC, the world’s leading chip maker, but for the first time, Apple must compete for space in TSMC’s factories. The article explains how Apple once dominated TSMC’s orders, but Nvidia’s demand for AI chips is now growing much faster.

TSMC recently raised prices, and Apple has to pay more for its chips. But the bigger problem is that Nvidia and other AI companies—like AMD, Google, and Amazon—are ordering so many chips that TSMC’s factories are simply full. Nvidia may have even passed Apple as TSMC’s largest customer for some months. This shows a big change: while Apple’s growth in device sales is slow, Nvidia’s sales are jumping because of the AI boom.

TSMC’s business is shifting. High-performance computing (HPC), which includes AI chips, is now a bigger part of TSMC’s revenue than smartphone chips. TSMC is still making new chip factories for advanced technology, but it keeps old factories running too, so it can serve both new and old customers. Apple still buys a wide mix of chips from TSMC for iPhones, Macs, and other devices, but Nvidia’s orders are huge and focused on the latest technology.

TSMC is careful not to build too many new factories too quickly, even though some people—like analyst Benedict Evans—say it should expand faster to meet Nvidia’s needs. TSMC’s CEO says this is risky, because if AI demand drops, TSMC could be stuck with empty factories. Building a new chip factory is expensive and takes years, so TSMC must plan ahead.

Apple’s orders are steady and spread across many factories, while Nvidia’s are big but focused. The AI boom may slow in the future, and then Apple’s stable business will still be important for TSMC. For now, though, Nvidia is becoming the key driver of TSMC’s growth.

In the Hacker News comments, some people think this shift is normal and shows how the tech industry is changing fast. Others worry about what happens if the AI bubble bursts—will TSMC be left with too much capacity? Some point out that Apple is still important because it brings steady business, while Nvidia’s big orders might not last forever. A few commenters discuss how TSMC’s careful planning is smart, since building factories is risky and expensive. Others debate if TSMC should actually expand faster to capture all of Nvidia’s business.

Some users compare TSMC’s approach to other companies, like Intel, and note that TSMC’s business model—building new factories for each chip generation—is unusual but effective. People also wonder how the fight for chip supply will affect prices and innovation in the tech world. There’s talk about how chip shortages could impact both AI companies and phone makers, leading to higher prices for everyone. A few commenters say that in the end, TSMC holds a lot of power because everyone needs its chips, and whoever controls the best factories can shape the whole tech industry.

## Inside The Internet Archive's Infrastructure

- 原文链接: [Inside The Internet Archive's Infrastructure](https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46613324)

This article looks at the Internet Archive and how it saves so much of the web’s history. The Archive runs out of an old church in San Francisco and tries to collect, store, and protect digital content, even as the web keeps growing and changing.

The main storage system is called the PetaBox. It uses normal computer parts, not expensive enterprise gear, to save lots of data for less money and energy. The Archive has about 20,000 hard drives and over 200 petabytes of data, with more added all the time. The system does not use air conditioning—San Francisco’s cool air and the heat from the drives keep the building warm. When drives break, staff replace them only when needed, not right away.

To collect web pages, the Archive started with a tool called Heritrix. This crawler works well for simple web pages but struggles with modern sites that use lots of JavaScript, like social media. The Archive later added tools like Brozzler and Umbra, which act more like real browsers and can save content that loads after the first page. Anyone can also use "Save Page Now" to quickly add a web page to the Archive. At first, a company called Alexa Internet helped by giving the Archive its web crawls, but now the Archive relies more on its own tools.

Money is always a challenge. The Archive’s budget is small compared to big tech companies. Most money comes from donations and grants. Extra income comes from services like Archive-It, which lets libraries and schools make their own web archives, and from digitizing books for other groups. By building its own hardware and using open-source software, the Archive keeps costs low.

Legal problems are a big risk. The Archive got sued by book publishers for letting people borrow scanned books during Covid, and lost in court. It also got in trouble with music companies for digitizing old records. After settling, the Archive had to remove many books and limit access to some music. But in 2025, the Archive became a Federal Depository Library, giving it special protection for saving US government documents.

To protect against disasters or shutdowns, the Archive is moving toward decentralization. This means making many copies of its data and sharing them around the world using tools like IPFS and Filecoin, so no single event can destroy the Archive’s collection. The Archive is also using AI to help organize and scan its content, and it wants to keep the web open for everyone.

In the Hacker News comments, many people praised the Archive’s technical creativity, especially the custom PetaBox and the use of natural cooling. Some discussed the big legal risks, saying they worry about the Archive’s future if lawsuits keep coming. Others debated the balance between copyright and public access, with some feeling the Archive should be more careful, while others think it should fight harder for free information. A few commenters shared their own stories of rescuing lost web pages thanks to the Archive, calling it a vital tool for history. Some developers wanted to help with decentralization or support the Archive with donations. Still, a few worried that decentralization might bring new problems, like low quality copies or copyright abuse. Many agreed that without the Archive, much of the internet’s history would be lost, and they hoped more people would support it.

## CVEs affecting the Svelte ecosystem

- 原文链接: [CVEs affecting the Svelte ecosystem](https://svelte.dev/blog/cves-affecting-the-svelte-ecosystem)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46636387)

The Svelte team shared news about five security problems (CVEs) found in popular Svelte tools and libraries. These issues affect packages like devalue, svelte, @sveltejs/kit, and @sveltejs/adapter-node, and users are told to update to safe versions right away.

The post lists each problem and who is at risk. Two CVEs affect the devalue library, where a user can send bad data to use up all memory and crash the app. This mostly matters if your app lets users send their own data to devalue.parse, especially with SvelteKit remote functions. Another CVE affects @sveltejs/kit, where a bug in remote functions can let someone send a form that uses up lots of memory and stops the app. There’s also a serious problem with the @sveltejs/kit and @sveltejs/adapter-node packages: if your app uses prerendered pages and is not set up correctly, hackers could make your server crash (DoS) or even access private resources (SSRF). The last CVE is about XSS in svelte when using the hydratable option with unsanitized user keys, which could let attackers send harmful code to users.

The Svelte team thanks security researchers and the community for helping make fixes fast. They say there have been many recent bugs in web tools, but it’s good to see everyone working together. They promise to make their process better so bugs can be caught before they go live. If someone finds a new security issue, the team asks them to report it privately through GitHub.

In the comments, many people thank the Svelte team for acting quickly and being open about the problems. Some users say it’s a reminder to always update dependencies and watch for advisories. Others talk about how tricky it is to avoid bugs like these, especially with features that allow user input. A few commenters discuss how Svelte’s response compares to other frameworks; some say this level of care builds trust. Some developers are surprised at how even small packages like devalue can affect whole systems. Others ask for more tools to help check for risky settings, like remote functions or missing environment variables. A few mention they wish updating was easier, especially for larger projects. There are also comments from people who think every project should have a better process for handling reports and patching fast. Finally, some note that security issues are common in all frameworks, and what matters most is how teams respond and help users stay safe.

## JuiceFS is a distributed POSIX file system built on top of Redis and S3

- 原文链接: [JuiceFS is a distributed POSIX file system built on top of Redis and S3](https://github.com/juicedata/juicefs)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46637165)

JuiceFS is an open-source, distributed file system that lets you use cloud storage like S3 as if it were a regular local disk. It keeps your files’ data in object storage services (like Amazon S3), while it stores metadata in fast databases such as Redis or MySQL.

JuiceFS works with POSIX, so you can use it with most Linux programs and tools without changing anything. It is also compatible with Hadoop and Kubernetes, making it useful for big data and cloud setups. You can share JuiceFS between many servers. It offers strong consistency—so if you change a file, everyone sees the change right away. JuiceFS is fast: latency can be just a few milliseconds, and throughput can grow very large as you add more storage. Your data is safe with encryption during transfer and at rest. JuiceFS splits files into chunks and blocks, which it stores in object storage, while the metadata (like file names and permissions) stays in the database. This setup keeps things fast and reliable. It supports many storage backends, including S3, Google Cloud, Azure Blob, and even local disks. JuiceFS passes all standard POSIX tests and supports extra features like file locks, mmap, and compression. There’s a Kubernetes driver, S3 gateway, and the format is stable across releases.

From the Hacker News comments, some users are impressed by how easy JuiceFS is to set up and how well it works with cloud tools. People like that you don’t need to change your apps to use it. Some say JuiceFS is much faster than S3FS or EFS for many use cases. Others warn that using Redis for metadata means you need to handle Redis carefully, or risk losing file system information. A few readers are unsure about using a cloud file system for very high-performance needs, saying local disks or NFS might still be faster. Some mention that JuiceFS is good for machine learning and sharing data between many compute jobs. One commenter worries about the cost of cloud object storage at scale. Another says they like that JuiceFS is open source and has a friendly community. There are also questions about security, backup, and the best ways to use JuiceFS with Kubernetes. Overall, the community sees JuiceFS as a strong choice for cloud-native storage, but with some points to consider for very special workloads.

## Ask HN: How can we solve the loneliness epidemic?

- 原文链接: [Ask HN: How can we solve the loneliness epidemic?](item?id=46635345)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46635345)

This post talks about people feeling lonely and asks how we can help fix this problem. The article explains that many people, even those with jobs or families, feel alone and want more real connections.

Some reasons for loneliness are working from home, spending too much time online, or moving away from family. The article says that in the past, people had more local activities, like church, sports, or clubs, where they could meet others. Now, many people do not have places like this. It suggests that just having more social media or talking online is not enough. Real, face-to-face meetings are important for feeling close to others.

The article gives some ideas to help. It says people should try to join local clubs, go to community events, or even talk to neighbors. Volunteering is also a good way to meet people and feel needed. The article also says that workplaces could help by planning social activities. It suggests cities could make more parks or spaces for people to meet. The main message is that fighting loneliness takes effort from both people and the community.

In the comments, some people agree and share their own stories about feeling lonely. A few say that moving to a new city made it hard to make friends. Others think technology is the problem, because people spend more time on their phones than talking face-to-face. Some suggest forming small groups based on hobbies or interests, like board games or coding meetups.

Others say that it’s not only about meeting people, but also about building deeper friendships. A few think that social skills should be taught in schools. Some comment that it can be scary to talk to strangers, but it gets easier with practice. There are also people who say that loneliness is a normal feeling sometimes, and that it’s okay to be alone for a while. At the end, many agree that everyone should try, even in small ways, to reach out and help others feel welcome.

## Claude is good at assembling blocks, but still falls apart at creating them

- 原文链接: [Claude is good at assembling blocks, but still falls apart at creating them](https://www.approachwithalacrity.com/claude-ne/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46618042)

This article looks at how well Claude, an AI tool, can help with real software engineering tasks. The author says Claude is very good at putting together existing parts or "blocks," but not so good at making new ones from scratch.

First, the author shares a success story: Claude ran a debugging loop with Sentry and Playwright and fixed a problem by itself in about 90 minutes. In another example, Claude did a cloud migration from Modal to AWS ECS using Terraform and Docker. It finished the job in just a few hours, which saved the author a lot of time. These tasks worked well because Claude had clear instructions and used strong tools or abstractions.

But the author then gives a counterexample. When asked to improve messy React code, Claude suggested a simple but bad solution: doing a slow search through a list instead of fixing the root data flow problem. This would have made the codebase worse, not better. The author explains that good engineers don’t just patch things—they look for better, cleaner solutions, even if it takes more time.

The key point is that Claude works best when you give it good, well-designed building blocks. It can’t make these blocks by itself. If the code or the problem is messy, Claude often gets confused or makes things worse. The author compares Claude to a smart child who loves building with legos, but can’t invent new legos.

The article ends by saying that Claude—and AI tools like it—don’t have the creative drive or understanding that great engineers do. This means human engineers are still very important, especially for hard or new problems. AI can save time on boring or repetitive work, but it’s not ready to replace experienced developers.

In the comments, many readers agree that Claude is impressive for automating routine tasks. Some say it’s like having a helpful junior engineer who can follow instructions but needs guidance. Others warn that trusting AI too much can lead to bad code if you don’t review its work. A few people feel that AI will improve very quickly, so we shouldn’t get too comfortable. Some share their own stories of AI tools doing great with clear rules but failing in messy real-world code. There’s a debate about whether AI will ever be able to design new abstractions or if it will always need humans for that. Some think the real value of AI is in helping humans work faster, not in replacing them. Others worry that companies might try to cut corners and let AI do more than it should, creating problems later. Overall, most agree that, for now, senior engineers are safe and still needed.

## Aviator (YC S21) is hiring to build multiplayer AI coding platform

- 原文链接: [Aviator (YC S21) is hiring to build multiplayer AI coding platform](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/aviator/jobs)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46639248)

Aviator is a startup from Y Combinator that is hiring engineers to help build a multiplayer AI coding platform. The company is focused on making tools that help software teams work faster and better by using AI.

Aviator’s platform is already used by big names like Slack, Figma, and DoorDash. They offer tools such as MergeQueue, which stops code merge problems, and FlexReview, which helps send code reviews to the right people. Their newest tool, Runbooks, is an AI agent that teams can use together to automate hard tasks just by writing what they want in plain language.

Aviator believes that AI will not replace engineers, but will help them do much more with smaller teams. They think jobs that used to need many people and a lot of time will soon be done by small groups in just minutes, thanks to AI. The company is based in San Francisco, has a small team, and is looking for both senior and fullstack engineers.

In the Hacker News comments, some people like the idea of AI making teams more productive, and think Aviator’s tools look useful for big companies. Others are worried about AI taking over too many parts of coding, saying it could make jobs less creative or even take away jobs. A few developers say they like the focus on helping teams, not just single users.

There are questions about how well the tools work for real teams, and if they fit with different ways people write code. A few people mention concerns about privacy and control, since AI tools often handle sensitive code. Some are excited that Aviator is still small and hiring, seeing it as a chance to join early and help shape the company.

Others ask about the company’s plans for growth, and if they can compete with big tech firms making their own AI tools. Some commenters wish there was more info on how the AI works, and wonder if it will be easy for new engineers to use. A few people point out that changing how teams work is hard, and not everyone will want to switch to new tools. Overall, the discussion is a mix of excitement, questions, and some caution about the future of AI in coding.

## Show HN: OpenWork – an open-source alternative to Claude Cowork

- 原文链接: [Show HN: OpenWork – an open-source alternative to Claude Cowork](https://github.com/different-ai/openwork)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46612494)

OpenWork is a new open-source app that works like Claude Cowork, but you can use it for free and even change the code. It is made for people who work with knowledge and want to use AI agents in their daily jobs. OpenWork gives you a desktop app where you pick a workspace, start a project, see the agent's plan, and approve actions if needed. You can save useful workflows as templates and use “skills” to add new features. The app is built on top of OpenCode, and it makes using AI agents feel more like using a real product instead of a command line tool. You can run OpenWork on your own computer or connect it to a server. It shows live updates, keeps a timeline of what the agent does, and asks for your permission before running important actions. You can install new skills through a simple manager, and all workflows are easy to see and repeat. The app is open-source (MIT license), so you can check the code and change it if you want. Requirements include Node.js, Rust, and the OpenCode CLI. The project is still new (version 0.1), but it already supports local and remote work, templates, plugins, and live updates.

In the Hacker News comments, some users are excited to see a free and open alternative to Claude Cowork. They like that the project is not just a copy, but adds its own ideas. A few people ask how easy it is to set up and if it works on Windows or Linux, not just Mac. Some are worried about needing Rust and Node.js together, saying that can be hard for beginners. There are questions about what “agentic work” really means in practice and how safe it is to let AI agents change files. One commenter points out that asking for permissions before actions is a good feature. Another person wonders if it will support more AI models or only OpenCode. A few users suggest that making a web version would help more people try it. Some say open-source tools like this are needed because commercial AI agents can be expensive or closed. Others think the project is still very new and want to wait for more updates before using it for real work. Overall, people see promise but want to see how the project grows.

## Go-legacy-winxp: Compile Golang 1.24 code for Windows XP

- 原文链接: [Go-legacy-winxp: Compile Golang 1.24 code for Windows XP](https://github.com/syncguy/go-legacy-winxp/tree/winxp-compat)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46588243)

This project lets you compile Go 1.24 code for Windows XP, even though the normal Go release no longer supports XP or Windows 7. It’s a special version of Go, forked from another project that keeps Go working on Windows 7, and adds more changes to help it run on XP. Some main changes include bringing back old Windows system calls, fixing problems with libraries, and restoring the classic way to use `go get` without modules. The project tries to keep Go updated with the latest bug fixes, but also adds special code to work around missing functions on old Windows.

You can use this fork by downloading pre-built files or by building it from the source. The instructions show how to set up Go on Windows, macOS, or Linux, and explain how to set your system path and environment variables, so your programs can use this version of Go. The project welcomes feedback and code contributions, but asks that big bug reports go to the main Go tracker.

In the comments, people have different opinions. Some users think it’s amazing that anyone still wants to support Windows XP, since it is very old and not secure. A few say that, in some countries or businesses, XP is still used because of old hardware or important software that only runs on XP. Others warn that using XP is risky, and that keeping up old code is a lot of work. Some people are happy to see the classic `go get` mode return, since they find Go modules confusing. A few users share stories about supporting old systems at work, and say it’s helpful to have tools like this fork. There are also questions about how much work it takes to keep Go running on XP, and if it makes sense to do so. Some suggest that if you need to run code on XP, it might be better to use an older version of Go instead of patching the latest one. Overall, the project gets respect for the effort, even if many think it’s not practical for most people.
