## Show HN: I was curious about spherical helix, ended up making this visualization

- 原文链接: [Show HN: I was curious about spherical helix, ended up making this visualization](https://visualrambling.space/moving-objects-in-3d/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44962066)

This article is about how to move objects along a spherical helix path in 3D space using math. The author got curious about spherical helices and decided to make a web visualization to show how these paths work.

First, the article explains basic 3D movement by introducing the x, y, and z axes. Moving an object means changing its position along these three lines. The author uses math functions like cosine and sine to change the position over time. For example, using a cosine function moves a cube back and forth along the x-axis. If you use both sine and cosine for x and y, you get a circle. By making the radius grow over time, you turn the circle into a spiral.

The next step is moving into 3D with a spherical helix. Here, the z-value changes over time, so the path is not flat. The x and y positions are also changed by multiplying them with another sine function, so the path grows and shrinks instead of going out forever. This makes the shape wrap around a sphere. All these movements are created using parametric equations—math formulas that say where the object should be at every moment.

The author finishes by saying that once you know how to use these equations, you can make all kinds of interesting paths, from circles to spirals to very complex shapes. The article aims to make 3D math fun and creative, not just technical.

In the comments, many people said they liked the clear, step-by-step visuals and explanations. Some mentioned how hard 3D math can be at first, but this article made it seem simple and fun. A few users pointed out ways to make the code even smoother, like using quaternions or more advanced math libraries. Others shared their own experiments with 3D paths, such as using Three.js or Blender. There was discussion about how these ideas could help in games or simulations.

One commenter asked about the real-world uses for spherical helices. Another person explained they’re found in nature, like in DNA or antenna designs. Some people wished for more interactive controls, like changing the equations live. A few users liked that the article didn’t assume much math knowledge and thought it could help beginners learn parametric equations. Overall, readers agreed that visual, hands-on learning is the best way to understand tricky math ideas like these.

## Introduction to AT Protocol

- 原文链接: [Introduction to AT Protocol](https://mackuba.eu/2025/08/20/introduction-to-atproto/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44965233)

This article explains how the AT Protocol (ATProto) works, which is the technology behind Bluesky, a new social network. ATProto is made to allow many different apps and services to connect and work together, not just Bluesky itself.

The main part of ATProto is the idea of “records”—these are pieces of data like posts, follows, likes, and profiles. Each user owns their own records, and only they can change them. Images and videos are stored as “blobs,” which are kept on the same server as records but are different types of data. Every type of record has a “lexicon”—a kind of schema that says what data it holds and how it’s structured. Users are identified by something called a DID (Decentralized Identifier), which never changes, even if the user changes their handle (username). Handles are like domain names, and you can change them easily without breaking links, because all important references use the DID.

All user data is kept in a “repository” (repo), grouped by type. Data is shared between servers using special URIs called AT URIs. The protocol uses APIs called XRPC, with endpoints for different actions. For rich text, ATProto uses “facets”—these are markings that tell apps how to show hashtags, mentions, and links.

There are several types of servers in ATProto:  
- PDS (Personal Data Server), which stores all your records and blobs.  
- Relay, which combines data streams from many PDSes and makes it easier for other services to get all network data.  
- AppView, which processes data from relays and provides API endpoints for client apps. It also handles things like search, threads, and showing likes or followers.  

Other parts include labellers (for moderation), feed generators (for custom feeds), and client apps (the software users interact with). ATProto allows users to move their accounts between servers without losing data, because everything is tied to the permanent DID. Most parts of the system are open source, but some, like AppView’s data handling for big scale, are not fully public.

In the comment section, many users liked how clear the article is, saying it helps them understand Bluesky and ATProto better. Some people compared it to ActivityPub (used by Mastodon), noting ATProto’s unique data ownership and account migration features. Others questioned if ATProto’s server setup will really enable true decentralization, or if most users will just use Bluesky’s own servers. There was discussion about the technical choices, like using CBOR for records and Merkle trees for data storage, with some users liking the modern approach and others worried about complexity.

A few commenters wondered about privacy and moderation, asking if users can truly control their data and what happens if a server goes down. Some developers were excited about the custom feed system, seeing it as a big step forward for social media. Others asked about the closed parts of the code, worrying this might limit trust or slow down third-party development. Lastly, people shared links to SDKs and tools, and gave advice for new developers wanting to try ATProto, saying the community is friendly and helpful.

## Zedless: Zed fork focused on privacy and being local-first

- 原文链接: [Zedless: Zed fork focused on privacy and being local-first](https://github.com/zedless-editor/zed)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44964916)

Zedless is a new fork of the Zed code editor, made to protect user privacy and work fully offline. The project removes all parts of Zed that need cloud services you cannot run yourself, and it turns off telemetry and crash reports. Zedless plans to let users pick their own network services if they want, but these features will be off by default and have no built-in providers. The fork also says it will never require contributors to sign over their copyright, so there is less risk for open source people.

All the software and its dependencies must have clear, open licenses; the project uses “cargo-about” tools to help with this. If a dependency is missing license info, or its license is not accepted, contributors are asked to fix it before the code is merged. The README says Zedless is a work-in-progress and welcomes help from others. It is licensed under the AGPL, a strong open source license.

In the comments, some people are excited to see a local-first, privacy-focused editor and want to try it. Others are happy about the removal of telemetry and closed cloud features, which they see as a problem in many modern tools. Some users point out that keeping everything local can make it harder to use advanced features like AI code assistants or real-time collaboration, but others reply that privacy is more important. There are questions about how easy it will be to keep up-to-date with upstream Zed changes, and if the fork can get enough support.

A few commenters worry that removing crash reporting might make it hard to fix bugs, but others say open source users can report issues themselves. Some people want to know if the project will support Windows, Linux, and macOS equally well. Others mention they would like local-only plugins and extensions, not just the editor itself. A few express hope that Zedless can inspire more open source software to respect privacy and user control. Finally, some users say they will wait until Zedless is more finished before switching, but they are watching the project closely.

## Gemma 3 270M re-implemented in pure PyTorch for local tinkering

- 原文链接: [Gemma 3 270M re-implemented in pure PyTorch for local tinkering](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/tree/main/ch05/12_gemma3)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44962059)

This project shows how to build the Gemma 3 270M language model from scratch using only PyTorch, so you can run and change it on your own computer. The code is given as Jupyter notebooks and needs about 2 GB of RAM, so most laptops can handle it. There are two main notebooks: one for the basic model, and another that adds a “KV cache” to make it run much faster by saving past results. The author also links to another article that explains how KV caching works in detail.

The README gives speed test results for different hardware. For example, on a Mac Mini M4 CPU, the regular model gets about 8 tokens per second, but with KV cache and some extra code tricks, it jumps up to 224 tokens per second. On an Nvidia A100 GPU, speeds can go up to 128 tokens per second for the regular compiled model, and 99 tokens per second with KV cache and compiling.

The project also compares Gemma 3 270M to another model, Qwen3 0.6B, showing how these small models perform differently. There are links to articles where you can read more about how these models are built and how they compare to others, like DeepSeek-V3 and Kimi K2.

In the Hacker News comments, some people are happy to see a simple, readable PyTorch implementation instead of only using big, hard-to-read frameworks. They say it helps them learn how language models work inside. Others like that the model is small enough to run on normal hardware, making it easy to tinker and experiment. A few users discuss how useful KV caching is for making models much faster, but they note it adds some code complexity.

Some developers say these kinds of “from scratch” projects are great for teaching and make the field more open to everyone, not just big companies. However, a few point out that, while fun for learning, these mini-models are not useful for real tasks compared to giant models. There’s also talk about how PyTorch is still a favorite for research, even as more production code moves to other systems. Finally, people share ideas for making the code even faster or smaller, and some ask about trying it on other hardware, like older laptops or single-board computers.

- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44966170)

PlutoPrint is a Python tool that lets you turn HTML or XML into PDF files or images, like PNG. It uses another project called PlutoBook to handle the rendering. The library is made for tasks like creating reports, invoices, or even snapshots of web content.

You can install PlutoPrint easily with pip, but for a faster setup, the authors suggest installing PlutoBook and its parts first. On Windows and Linux 64-bit, prebuilt binaries are available, so installation is simple. To use it, you can run a command to convert HTML to PDF, or you can use Python code to load HTML and save it as a PDF or PNG. There are examples showing how to center text, set page sizes, and even create images from dynamic data.

One interesting feature is that you can use PlutoPrint with Matplotlib to generate charts inside your documents. The code sample shows how to make bar charts and embed them as SVG images in the output. You can also style your documents with CSS rules for layout and appearance. The project provides links to docs and sample files to help new users. PlutoPrint is open source under the MIT license, so you can use it for free, even in business projects.

Now, looking at the Hacker News comments, some users are happy to see a new HTML-to-PDF tool, since many old ones (like wkhtmltopdf or WeasyPrint) have problems or are hard to install. People like that PlutoPrint has prebuilt binaries, which means less setup and fewer errors. Others talk about the need for good CSS and SVG support, asking if PlutoPrint handles tricky layouts, fonts, or complex charts. Some users ask about speed and memory use compared to older tools.

A few developers share their issues with other PDF tools, like missing fonts or trouble with JavaScript in HTML. One person wonders if PlutoPrint can render modern web pages that use lots of CSS features. Another user mentions that open source tools like this are important, so we do not have to rely on closed, paid products. Some users wish for easy Docker support or a REST API for cloud use. Others are waiting to see if the project will keep getting updates and bug fixes. Overall, most commenters are hopeful and want to try PlutoPrint, but they also ask for more details about features and future plans.

## An Update on Pytype

- 原文链接: [An Update on Pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44963724)

Pytype is a tool from Google that checks Python code for type errors before you run it. The main news is that Pytype will only support Python up to version 3.12, and Google will not add support for future Python versions. 

Pytype started back in 2012 to help Google engineers catch bugs early. At first, it used its own way to guess types and used interface files. Later, as Python’s type hints became more popular, Pytype switched to using inline type hints but kept its guessing engine. The team also worked with mypy and Python’s creator to build "typeshed," which is a big library of type definitions for Python. 

One of the main reasons for stopping Pytype updates is that it works by reading Python bytecode, but Python’s bytecode changes often. This makes it hard to keep Pytype up to date with new Python features and typing ideas. So, Google wants to try new ways to check types, which might work better for big codebases like Google’s. They say the Python typing world is now strong and has many other good tools, so users should look at other options. 

The team thanks all the people who worked on Pytype, especially the main developers. They mention Rebecca Chen, who worked on Pytype for ten years and helped Python’s type system grow. Pytype is open source, with almost 5,000 stars on GitHub, and it has helped many developers and projects.

In the comments, some people say Pytype was useful for catching bugs but agree with Google’s decision because bytecode is hard to work with. Others mention that there are now many good type checkers for Python, like mypy, Pyright, and Pyre, which don’t have the same problems as Pytype. Some users are sad to see it go, as it was a unique tool, especially for type inference (guessing types without hints). A few say they liked Pytype for checking untyped code, while others found it hard to set up or too slow for big projects. There is talk about how Python’s type system keeps changing, and tools need lots of work to keep up. A few people wonder what new ideas Google will try next and hope they share them with the community. Some thank the team for being open about their plans and for all their past work. There are also wishes for Pytype to keep working as long as possible for those who still need it.

You’d also create datasets and tests to make sure models can keep up with new fraud tricks. For backend work, you’d build and manage Python/Django services, handle large amounts of data from payment platforms, and make sure everything runs fast and reliably. They want someone with at least three years of experience working in production systems, especially with language models and fraud or anomaly detection. Experience with imbalanced data and compliance rules is a plus. The job promises a high-impact, fast-paced environment and expects employees to be highly motivated and ready to work beyond standard hours. Compensation is between $125K and $160K plus equity.

In the top comments, people discuss the challenge of finding skilled AI engineers, especially ones who know both machine learning and backend work. Some say the job description asks for a lot—expecting expertise in both ML and large-scale backend systems. Others wonder if the salary is enough for the Bay Area, given the required skills and long hours. A few think that working on real fraud problems is interesting and rewarding, but warn it can be stressful and fast-changing. There is debate about whether requiring four days in the office is reasonable for such a technical role. Some like the idea of working at a small, high-growth startup, while others point out that work-life balance might be hard with the high expectations. A few mention that working with real payment data and fighting fraud sounds meaningful. Some users suggest that the job might be a good fit for people who want to have a big impact and learn quickly, but not for everyone. Others ask about technology choices, such as using Django for high-speed APIs. There is also interest in how Coris handles model updates and adapts to new fraud patterns.

## Visualizing GPT-OSS-20B embeddings

- 原文链接: [Visualizing GPT-OSS-20B embeddings](https://melonmars.github.io/LatentExplorer/embedding_viewer.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44932509)

A new tool lets you look at the embeddings from a big language model called GPT-OSS-20B. The tool shows these embeddings as points in a 3D space that you can move around and zoom in or out.

Embeddings are special numbers that help the model understand the meaning of words and sentences. Each word or phrase gets its own spot in this space. If two words are close together, the model thinks they are similar. The viewer is made to handle many points at once, so you can see patterns in how the model groups words. You can drag the view with your mouse, use your scroll wheel to zoom, and hover over points to get more details. If you get lost in the view, a quick double-click or pressing the spacebar will reset everything. This makes it easy to explore big sets of data and understand how the model “thinks.” The tool is open for everyone and works in your web browser.

People in the comments liked seeing embeddings in a simple, clear way. Some users said it helped them understand what language models are doing inside. Others pointed out that with so many points, things can get slow on old computers. A few wanted more features, like searching for words or grouping points by meaning. Some people discussed how these visualizations can show hidden biases in the model. One user said it would be great for teaching students about AI. Another person wondered if it could work with other models too. A few warned that the 3D view can be confusing if you are not used to it. Most agreed that tools like this make AI less mysterious and easier to talk about.

## Gouach wants you to insert and pluck the cells from its Infinite e-bike battery

- 原文链接: [Gouach wants you to insert and pluck the cells from its Infinite e-bike battery](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/gouach-wants-you-to-insert-and-pluck-the-cells-from-its-infinite-e-bike-battery/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44936535)

Gouach, a small French company, has made a new e-bike battery where you can easily remove and replace the small battery cells inside. Most e-bike batteries today are hard to fix, even if only a few cells are broken, because they are welded shut and need special tools to open. Gouach wants to change that with its "Infinite Battery," which uses a tough, fireproof case and lets you swap out 18650 battery cells using just a screwdriver. The battery shows cell health and temperature in a phone app, and it is made to fit most common e-bikes. To make this work safely, Gouach designed special circuit boards to hold the cells in place, so they don’t shake loose while riding. They also built a strong, waterproof case after early versions broke from water getting in during bike-share use. Gouach is planning to sell the battery to e-bike companies, repair shops, and people building their own bikes. The battery comes in different sizes and should work with many e-bike brands, even some that use special encrypted systems like Bosch. Gouach funded its work through crowdfunding and investors, and plans to start shipping in Europe soon, then the US, though high tariffs are causing some problems.

In the comments, many people liked the idea and said it could help reduce waste, since you don’t have to throw away the whole battery when only a few cells go bad. Some users pointed out that replacing cells is common with laptop batteries or flashlights, but rare in e-bikes. Others worried about safety, since not everyone knows how to handle batteries correctly, and mistakes can cause fires. A few commenters wondered if e-bike makers will support these batteries, or if companies will try to block third-party repairs. Some users shared stories about trying to fix their own e-bike batteries and liked that Gouach makes it simpler. Others asked about the cost and if the battery would really last longer than normal ones. There was also talk about how tariffs and rules in different countries might make it hard to buy or ship these batteries. Overall, people agreed that making batteries easier to repair is a good step, but there are still many details and problems to solve before it becomes common.
