## Flock cameras gifted by Horowitz Foundation, avoiding public oversight

- 原文链接: [Flock cameras gifted by Horowitz Foundation, avoiding public oversight](https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/vegas-police-are-big-users-of-license-plate-readers-public-has-little-input-because-its-a-gift)

Las Vegas police are using Flock license plate reader cameras, but the public did not get to vote or give input because the cameras were donated by the Horowitz Family Foundation, not paid for with taxpayer money. Flock cameras scan cars and collect data, which police can use to track vehicles across the country. 

Normally, if police want to buy this kind of surveillance tech with public funds, there are public meetings and people can share their thoughts. But because these cameras were a gift, the police skipped public discussion and oversight. Many people are worried this avoids democracy—residents did not get a chance to agree or disagree about the cameras watching them. The cameras gather lots of information, like car color and model, and add it to a big database that hundreds of law enforcement agencies can access.

The agreement with Flock also lets the company use the data for any purpose they want, and they keep the recordings for up to 30 days. The police say they will not target people based on things like race or political views, and that misuse of data will lead to discipline. Still, some officers and privacy experts are afraid there is not enough transparency. For example, the rules about how Metro police use Flock are not online for the public, unlike some other cities.

There have been cases in the U.S. where police misused Flock cameras to track ex-partners or people they know. Some experts say these cameras could be used to find undocumented immigrants, political protesters, or people seeking abortions. Even though Flock says it does not work directly with immigration enforcement, it must follow subpoenas and legal requests, so data can still end up in federal hands. Critics also point out that knowing you are being watched can make people afraid to go to certain places, like clinics or support meetings.

The Horowitz Foundation gave almost $2 million for the cameras and more for supporting software. They also donated other tech, like drones and Cybertrucks, to the police. Supporters of these gifts say they help police fight crime and keep the community safe without using public money. The foundation’s leader says she wants to make Las Vegas the best community by fighting crime. 

Some people in the comments think private funding is dangerous because it avoids public checks and could lead to misuse or abuse. Others say if the cameras help catch criminals, it’s a good thing, especially if it saves tax dollars. A few worry that when the donation money ends, taxpayers might have to pay for ongoing costs. Some people comment that giving police so much surveillance power without asking the public is a big risk, especially if the technology spreads to other cities. Others suggest that better rules and more transparency are needed, no matter who pays for the cameras. Some developers in the thread think tech like Flock could be useful, but only if there are strong protections against abuse, and clear ways for the public to push back. A few also point out that once this kind of tracking becomes normal, it is hard to go back, and privacy will be lost for everyone, not just criminals.

## UNIX99, a UNIX-like OS for the TI-99/4A

- 原文链接: [UNIX99, a UNIX-like OS for the TI-99/4A](https://forums.atariage.com/topic/380883-unix99-a-unix-like-os-for-the-ti-994a/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47127986)

This article talks about UNIX99, a new UNIX-like operating system made for the old TI-99/4A home computer. The TI-99/4A was a popular computer from the 1980s, and this project brings a modern OS experience to it.

The main idea is that UNIX99 lets you use UNIX-like commands and file systems on very old and limited hardware. The creator wanted to see if it was possible to put a small UNIX system on the TI-99/4A, which has only 16KB of RAM and a slow CPU. They had to write almost everything from scratch, including a basic shell, simple commands, and ways to manage files. The OS can run programs, read and write files, and even has user permissions, just like “real” UNIX. Many features had to be trimmed or rewritten to fit in memory. The author explains problems like getting the keyboard and screen to work, and how they solved them with clever code tricks. UNIX99 does not have multitasking because of hardware limits, but it still feels quite like UNIX.

In the Hacker News comments, some readers are amazed by the technical achievement and praise the author’s creativity. Others remember using the TI-99/4A as kids and feel nostalgic. Some people compare UNIX99 to other retro-computing projects that bring UNIX or Linux to old machines. A few commenters ask about the real use for UNIX99 and wonder if it’s just for fun or if it can teach us something new about computers. One person notes that working within strict limits helps programmers learn good habits. Another commenter talks about how modern systems are so complex, and it’s refreshing to see simple, small systems working well. There are also people who share tips or links about similar projects, like running Minix or Tiny Core Linux on small devices. Some wish there were more open-source examples or code to learn from. A few skeptics question whether anyone will use UNIX99 for real work, but most agree it’s an impressive and fun project.

## The Age Verification Trap: Verifying age undermines everyone's data protection

- 原文链接: [The Age Verification Trap: Verifying age undermines everyone's data protection](https://spectrum.ieee.org/age-verification)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47122715)

The article talks about new laws that want websites to check a user’s age to keep kids safe online, like on social media. But, it says that real age checks often make everyone give up more personal data, which is bad for privacy.

To really check age, websites ask for things like government ID or use AI to guess your age from selfies or how you use the site. Many teens do not have IDs, and using selfies or behavior is not always right. Sometimes adults get blocked for looking too young, and kids learn how to cheat the system with fake IDs or VPNs. If you appeal, you have to give even more private data, like a copy of your ID or more selfies, and companies have to keep this data for a long time to show they followed the law.

Big companies like Meta, TikTok, Google, and Roblox already use systems that check age again and again, not just once. Every time your behavior looks different, or you get a new device, you might have to prove your age again. This means companies collect and store a lot of data about everyone, not just kids.

In places where few people have IDs, like in parts of Brazil or Nigeria, companies rely more on guessing your age with AI or watching how you use the service. This often means even more surveillance, as they track more behaviors to try to guess who you are.

The article says privacy laws usually say companies should only collect data needed for a clear reason and not keep it too long. But when age checks are forced, companies keep more data for longer, because they have to show proof if the government asks. This clash between privacy and age checks is not something voters chose—it happens because companies want to avoid legal trouble.

Some people hope privacy-friendly age checks (like with a trusted third party) could fix things, but the article says these still have the same problem: not everyone has an official ID, so some users get locked out or tracked even more.

In the comment section, many readers agree with the article’s main point: strict age verification ends up hurting privacy for everyone, not just kids. Some users say these laws sound good but don’t work in real life, and that kids will always find ways around them. Others are worried about data leaks and hacks, since companies will have to store so much sensitive information. A few people point out that lawmakers often don’t understand the technical side and make rules that are hard to follow or easy to abuse. Some readers think society should focus on helping parents and teaching kids, not forcing tech companies to do impossible things. Still, a few comments say that some kind of age check is needed to protect kids, even if it is hard, but they wish for better, privacy-friendly solutions. Many hope that new laws will at least be clearer about the risks and not pretend there is a perfect answer.

## Americans are destroying Flock surveillance cameras

- 原文链接: [Americans are destroying Flock surveillance cameras](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/23/americans-are-destroying-flock-surveillance-cameras/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47127081)

This story is about people in the US damaging or taking down Flock cameras, which are used by police to watch cars and license plates. The article explains that these cameras are spreading quickly in many cities and neighborhoods.

Flock cameras take pictures of cars and record license plate numbers. Police use this data to find stolen cars, track suspects, or check on cars coming into an area. The company, Flock Safety, says their cameras help keep neighborhoods safe. Many people like the cameras because they hope crime will go down. Some cities use Flock cameras to help solve crimes faster. The cameras often sit on poles or traffic lights, and they run all day and night. They store data for a few weeks or months, depending on local rules.

But not everyone is happy about these cameras. Some people worry about privacy and don’t want police watching every car. Others think the cameras can be wrong, or that they might be used in unfair ways. In some places, people have started breaking, covering, or stealing the cameras to stop them from working. The article mentions examples where cameras were found damaged or missing. Flock says they work with police to fix or replace broken cameras. Still, the debate about safety versus privacy continues.

In the comments, some readers support the cameras, saying they help solve crimes and make streets safer. Others are very worried about privacy, saying this is too much surveillance. Some people think it is wrong to destroy cameras, even if you don’t like them, because it’s illegal. Others feel breaking the cameras is a form of protest against too much police power. A few commenters say these cameras are not very useful and just make people feel watched. Some share stories about similar cameras in their own towns. There is also talk about how easy it is to break or hide these cameras. Many agree the topic is complex, and there is no simple answer that makes everyone happy.

## Ladybird adopts Rust

- 原文链接: [Ladybird adopts Rust](https://ladybird.org/posts/adopting-rust/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47120899)

Ladybird, an open-source web browser project, is moving parts of its codebase from C++ to Rust, using AI tools to help with the translation. The team wants better memory safety and believes Rust is now mature enough for systems programming, with good community support and experience from other browsers like Firefox and Chromium.

At first, Ladybird did not choose Rust because Rust’s model did not fit well with their object-oriented C++ code. After more time, though, they decided Rust’s safety and ecosystem were worth the change. Their first target was LibJS, Ladybird’s JavaScript engine. To port the code, they used AI coding assistants like Claude Code and Codex, but humans still made all the decisions on what to translate and how to do it. The translation process involved hundreds of small tasks and prompts. Once the initial code was done, they used other AI models to review the new Rust code for bugs and bad patterns.

The main requirement was that the Rust version should produce the exact same output as the old C++ version. The team ported around 25,000 lines of code in about two weeks, which would have taken much longer by hand. Testing showed that every JavaScript output and bytecode was identical between the two versions, with zero test failures or lost performance. The Rust code still looks a lot like the original C++ code because they want to keep both versions compatible for now. In the future, they plan to clean up the code and make it more “Rust-like.” For now, new Rust and old C++ code will work together, and the team will carefully choose which parts to port next.

People in the Hacker News comments had lots of opinions. Some were excited to see a real-world example of using AI to speed up big code translations, and they think this could change how we update old software. A few users pointed out that the Rust code is not idiomatic yet, but they understand why: it needs to match the C++ version for now. Some commenters praised the strict testing and focus on compatibility. Others are wary about mixing C++ and Rust, worrying it might add complexity or bugs at the boundaries.

A few people asked about the long-term plan and if the whole project will become Rust in the future. Some are happy Ladybird did not use Swift, since its support outside Apple is weak. There’s debate about how much AI really helped—some think it just sped up simple translation, while others hope AI will soon handle more complex work. A few developers are interested in joining the project now that Rust is used, while others wish the team luck with the big job ahead. Many agree that safety is important and see this move as a positive step for Ladybird and for browsers in general.

## Show HN: PgDog – Scale Postgres without changing the app

- 原文链接: [Show HN: PgDog – Scale Postgres without changing the app](https://github.com/pgdogdev/pgdog)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47123631)

PgDog is a tool that sits between your app and PostgreSQL to help scale your database without changing your code. It acts as a connection pooler, load balancer, and sharding proxy, and is written in Rust for speed and safety.

PgDog allows many clients to connect while using only a few real database connections, thanks to pooling. It can also split your database into shards, so your data is spread across many servers. PgDog can balance queries between a main server (primary) and read-only copies (replicas), sending writes to the primary and reads to replicas. If you use sharding, PgDog figures out which shard your request should go to, either using PostgreSQL’s partitioning logic or by schema. For cross-shard queries, PgDog collects results from all shards and combines them before sending them back to your app, as if you have one big database. It also has health checks: if a database fails, PgDog won’t send new queries to it. PgDog supports failover too—it can switch to a new primary if your main server goes down. With its Docker and Kubernetes support, it is easy to try or run in the cloud. All features are controlled by simple config files, and you don’t need to change your app’s code to use it.

In the comments, some users are excited about how PgDog combines connection pooling, load balancing, and sharding, which usually require separate tools. Others mention that sharding is hard to get right, and are curious about how PgDog handles complex queries or transactions that touch more than one shard. Some compare PgDog to PgBouncer and Citus, noting that PgDog has more features out of the box. People like that PgDog is open source and written in Rust, but a few wonder if the AGPL license might be a problem for some companies. There are questions about performance, especially for very large workloads, and some users want to know how easy it is to migrate an existing database to use sharding with PgDog. A few commenters are cautious, saying sharding often adds complexity and should only be used when really needed. Many agree that having a drop-in tool to help scale Postgres is useful, especially for startups and growing teams. Some also praise the good documentation and examples. Overall, the community sees PgDog as a promising project that could save time and effort for many developers.

## The challenges of porting Shufflepuck Cafe to the 8 bits Apple II

- 原文链接: [The challenges of porting Shufflepuck Cafe to the 8 bits Apple II](https://www.colino.net/wordpress/archives/2026/02/23/the-challenges-of-porting-shufflepuck-cafe-to-the-8-bits-apple-ii/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47128631)

This article is about bringing the game Shufflepuck Cafe, first made in 1989, to the much older Apple II computer from 1979. The author explains all the hard parts and clever tricks needed to make the game work well on such limited hardware.

At first, the author did not know how to show moving game pieces (sprites) or handle a mouse on the Apple II. They learned by first making a simpler game, Glider, and used those lessons for Shufflepuck Cafe. A big challenge was making the table look 3D. The author used math tricks to make sprites look like they move in a 3D space, with special lookup tables to keep the game fast because the Apple II’s processor cannot do multiplication or division quickly.

Sprites also needed to look bigger or smaller depending on where they are on the table. The author made many versions of each sprite, at different sizes and positions, to avoid slowing the game down with real-time resizing. Drawing on the Apple II is slow, so more tricks were used: for some sprites, the author used a fast drawing method called XOR, which is quick but can look strange, while for others, they used a slower but better-looking method.

Sound was another problem. There was not enough memory for all the different sounds, so the author made a sound player that could slow down or play parts of sounds to save space. Memory was very limited, so the game only loads what it needs at the moment, and uses tricks like compressing files and reusing parts of memory for different things at different times. Some sounds had to be cut short or played in pieces because of the small memory size.

The author also wanted to include a special animated hand, like in the original game, but memory was too tight, so they made the hand smaller and changed how it appears. For two-player mode, the author used the Apple II’s serial port to let two computers play together, sending a single byte each frame to share the paddle positions. More data is sent only when something big happens, like a player hitting the puck.

In the comments, many people praise the hard work and creativity needed for this port. Some say it is impressive how the author fit so much into the old hardware, and that the lookup tables and memory tricks are smart. Others remember playing the original Shufflepuck Cafe and like seeing it on the Apple II. Some point out that old computers forced programmers to be clever, and this project shows that well. There are comments about the “race against the CRT beam” and how making games for old systems is both fun and difficult. A few people wish more new games were made for retro computers. Others ask technical questions about the drawing methods and memory tricks. Some suggest small changes or improvements, while others just thank the author for sharing so much detail. Overall, most readers seem happy, amazed, and inspired by the project.

## SIM (YC X25) Is Hiring the Best Engineers in San Francisco

- 原文链接: [SIM (YC X25) Is Hiring the Best Engineers in San Francisco](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/sim/jobs/Rj8TVRM-software-engineer-platform)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47128740)

Sim is a startup in San Francisco looking for a software engineer to help build its open-source platform for AI agent workflows. The company has a small team, offers good pay, and is backed by well-known investors like Y Combinator and Paul Graham.

The main job is to own and build the drag-and-drop visual canvas that lets developers connect AI models, tools, and APIs into working systems—like Figma, but for AI agents. You will work mostly on the front-end, using React, TypeScript, and Next.js, but you’ll also touch the backend sometimes. The platform needs to be fast, easy to use, and able to handle complex tasks without slowing down. The engineer will set the standards for how the codebase is organized and how the product feels for developers. Real-time editing, strong UX, and performance are very important. Experience with real-time systems (like WebSockets or CRDTs), AWS, and open-source work is a plus.

Sim has grown quickly, with over 70,000 users and 26,000 GitHub stars in less than a year. The company believes AI agents will be a big part of the future, and wants this platform to be the main tool people use to create them. The role gives lots of ownership—you help decide what to build, not just how to build it.

Benefits include equity, health insurance, and visa sponsorship. The interview process is a behavioral chat, a technical test, and a short work trial.

In the comments, some people are impressed by Sim’s fast growth and strong backing, saying it looks like a good opportunity for ambitious engineers. Others are cautious about the high expectations and the pressure that might come from working at a very small, in-person startup. A few discuss the job’s focus on front-end skills and note that building real-time, collaborative interfaces is hard but interesting work. Some users ask about remote work, but the job is in-person only, which some think could limit the talent pool. There are also comments about the pay and equity being fair for San Francisco, but some wish for more details about day-to-day life at the company. Finally, a few people talk about the big trend of “no-code” or “low-code” AI tools, and wonder if this style of platform will become common in the future.

## AI-powered reverse-engineering of Rosetta 2 for Linux

- 原文链接: [AI-powered reverse-engineering of Rosetta 2 for Linux](https://github.com/Inokinoki/attesor)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47129415)

This article is about a GitHub project called "attesor," which uses AI to reverse-engineer parts of Apple’s Rosetta 2, but for Linux. The project tries to understand and re-create some key functions from Rosetta 2, which is the tool that lets Macs with ARM chips run old x86_64 programs.

The main focus of the project is on reverse-engineering two kinds of functions from Rosetta 2. The first group is about GF(2^8) multiplication, which is a type of math used in cryptography. The second group is about AES cryptographic extensions, which help speed up secure data handling. The files in the repository show lots of work—there are files for different parts of the code, including C and Python scripts, and even documentation about what still needs to be done.

In one update, the project added support for special hardware functions like SHA-1 and SHA-256 hashing, CRC32 checksums, and random number generation. These are important for both security and performance. The README says the project is a work in progress, and it lists how many functions have been completed so far. The code looks like it tries to be as close as possible to what Rosetta 2 does, but on Linux.

The project uses AI tools to help break down the original Rosetta 2 binary and write new code that works the same way. There is also a signal handler, which helps the program manage certain events safely. The files are organized so others can look at the code and maybe help out.

In the Hacker News comments, many people are impressed by the effort and skill needed to reverse-engineer Rosetta 2, especially since Apple makes it hard to study their code. Some users worry about the legal risks, because Rosetta 2 is proprietary and Apple may not like people copying it. Others think this could be very useful for Linux users who want to run older Mac or Windows software on ARM machines.

A few commenters doubt that the project can ever fully match Rosetta 2’s performance, since Apple’s engineers have spent years on it. Some people point out that reverse engineering can be slow and sometimes never finishes. Others are excited that AI is being used to make sense of complex binaries, and hope these tools will get even better.

One user asks if this could lead to a version of Rosetta for Windows or other systems. Another notes that the cryptography functions are only a small part of the whole translator, and the hardest parts are still ahead. Some people discuss how open source projects like this help everyone learn, even if they never become drop-in replacements.

Finally, a few warn that projects like this should be careful about copyright, but most agree it’s a cool technical challenge and an interesting use of AI.

## 'Viking' was a job description, not a matter of heredity: Ancient DNA study

- 原文链接: ['Viking' was a job description, not a matter of heredity: Ancient DNA study](https://www.science.org/content/article/viking-was-job-description-not-matter-heredity-massive-ancient-dna-study-shows)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47100612)

The article shares new research about Vikings, based on ancient DNA. It says that being a Viking was more about what you did than who your parents were.

Scientists studied DNA from many Viking-age skeletons found in different places. They discovered that Vikings were not all from one family or ethnic group. Many people who joined Viking groups came from different backgrounds and places, not just Scandinavia. Some Vikings had ancestors from southern Europe, the British Isles, and even Asia. This shows that the Viking world was very mixed and open.

The researchers learned that “Viking” was more like a job title. Anyone could become a Viking if they joined the group and took part in raids or trade. People traveled far and mixed with many cultures. The study also found that Viking ships carried both men and women. Some Viking leaders were not even from Scandinavia, but learned the language and customs. This means that Viking identity was flexible. Being a Viking was about action, not blood.

Commenters on Hacker News found this research very interesting. Some said it matches what we know about other ancient groups, like pirates or mercenaries, where people joined from many places. A few discussed how popular culture gets Vikings wrong, showing them as all tall, blond Scandinavians. Others pointed out that language and culture can spread without everyone being related by blood.

Some users wondered what the word “Viking” really meant back then, and if it was always used the same way. A few thought the findings make history more exciting, showing how mixed and global the past was. Others shared that this might change how we think about identity and belonging today. Some people asked about the science of ancient DNA, and how sure we can be about the results. A few questioned if the term “job description” is the best way to describe Viking life, but most agreed that the study gives us a new way to see the past.
