Someone asked for advice about leaving a job in a tech company funded by venture capital (VC). They want to know how to move into a different kind of work or industry.

The original post explains that working in VC-backed tech often feels stressful and fast. The person feels tired of chasing growth and always being pushed to do more with less. They want a job with better work-life balance and less pressure. The writer asks the community if anyone has made a similar change, and what kinds of jobs or companies might be better. They also wonder if skills from VC tech are useful in other industries.

Many people in the comments agree that VC-backed tech jobs can burn you out quickly. Some say that traditional companies, government jobs, or non-profits may offer a slower pace and more stable work. Others suggest looking at remote work, freelancing, or starting a small business. A few people warn that bigger companies or older industries can be boring or slow, with lots of meetings and less freedom to build new things. Some commenters say skills like coding, project management, and teamwork are very useful almost anywhere. Others mention that pay might go down if you leave VC-backed tech, but that work-life balance can improve. One person shares their experience moving to a government job, saying the change was positive, but the culture was very different. Another person says to be careful about leaving just because of stress, and to think about what you really want in a job. A few people recommend talking to friends or mentors who have made similar changes. There is also advice to try contract work first, so you can explore different industries before making a big move. Overall, the discussion shows there are many ways to leave VC-backed tech, but it helps to think about your values and goals before you decide.

## NFS at 40 – Remembering the Sun Microsystems Network File System

This article celebrates the 40th anniversary of the Network File System (NFS), which started at Sun Microsystems in 1983 and is still important for sharing files between computers. The website collects documents about NFS, including design papers, technical specifications, and even old marketing materials and photos.

NFS made it possible for many computers to share files over a network as if the files were on their own hard drives. This was a big step for computer networks, helping offices and companies work together. The website divides its collection into four parts: source code and specs, important documents, info about similar or competing systems, and photos showing NFS history. Most of these items can be downloaded for free.

The site also links to all the official RFCs for NFS, which are the documents that explain how NFS works. There is another website, nfsv4bat.org, for newer NFS information, but it is slow and not secure. The NFS at 40 website was made by a group of people, including some of the original NFS team, and they welcome more contributions.

In the comments, many people share memories of using NFS in the early days of networking. Some say NFS was simple and easy to use, which helped it become popular. Others point out that NFS had security problems, especially in older versions, and warn not to use it on the public internet. A few users remember problems with file locking and data loss in the past, while some say NFS is still fast and useful today, especially in trusted networks.

Some commenters compare NFS to other network file systems like SMB and AFS. There are debates about which system is more reliable or better for different situations. A few mention that setting up NFS can be tricky, but once it works, it is stable. Others feel surprised that NFS is still used after so many years, and they thank the original team for their work. Finally, some people ask for more stories and technical details about how NFS was made and used in real life.
