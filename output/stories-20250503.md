The article talks about a robot developed by Google DeepMind that's pretty good at playing table tennis. The goal was to make a robot that plays at an amateur human level. The robot uses a special system to choose the best moves during a game, and it can adapt to different human players. In tests, the robot played 29 matches and won 45% of them. It beat all beginner players, won against 55% of intermediate players, but lost to all advanced players. This shows that the robot is at an intermediate level.

The robot's design has two main parts: low-level controllers for specific skills like different kinds of shots, and a high-level controller that chooses which skills to use. The robot learns by playing games in a simulation and then tries these skills in real matches, improving over time.

On Hacker News, people had mixed feelings about the robot's performance. Some thought it was impressive for an amateur level, while others felt it wasn't truly at a "human level" since it's far from professional play. A few commenters mentioned that the robot's success might be overstated because the videos show it making mistakes against even intermediate players. Some users pointed out that the robot struggles with spin, which is a big part of real table tennis games.

Others discussed the broader implications of using AI in this way, saying that while the tech is interesting, it's not quite the breakthrough that DeepMind suggests. Some also noted that using a robot on a track isn't the same as a human playing since humans have to manage their whole body in the sport. Overall, the project is seen as a step forward but not yet a game-changer in robotics and AI.

The article talks about images of the Milky Way found in ancient Egyptian art. Dr. Or Graur from the University of Portsmouth studied pictures of the sky-goddess Nut on ancient Egyptian coffins. Nut is often shown as a woman covered in stars, symbolizing the sky. Dr. Graur noticed that some images have a black curve, like the Milky Way's Great Rift, on Nut's body. He thinks this shows how the Egyptians saw the Milky Way as part of the sky, but not the same as Nut herself. The study mixes astronomy with Egyptology to explore Nut's link to the Milky Way, suggesting that the Egyptians used the Milky Way to highlight Nut's role in their mythology.

Now, let's see what people are saying about this on Hacker News. Many comments focus on how bright the stars can be when away from light pollution. One person recalls seeing the Milky Way clearly on a road trip in the US. Another mentions the amazing star views in rural Australia. Some people talk about how city lights hide the stars, making it hard for city dwellers to see the Milky Way. There's also skepticism about the connection between ancient art and the Milky Way, with some saying ancient people might not have fully understood what they were depicting. Lastly, someone points out how different cultures have had various interpretations of the Milky Way, showing it's not just an Egyptian phenomenon.
