Obsidian has a new tool called "Bases" that lets you turn your notes into a kind of database. With Bases, you can better organize things like projects, travel plans, or reading lists inside Obsidian.

The plugin lets you create a "base," which is just a collection of notes you can manage together. You can make and see different kinds of views, like lists or tables, depending on what you need. Bases let you filter your notes, add special properties, and use different layouts to make your information easier to see. You can also write formulas to do things like add up numbers or sort your notes. The syntax for these features is simple, and there are help pages to guide you if you get stuck. There’s a roadmap that shows what new features are coming soon. Everything works inside Obsidian, so you do not need a new app or service. It’s made to be easy to use, even if you are not a programmer. You can quickly create a base, link it to other notes, and use filters to find what you need. This makes Bases good for anyone who wants to track or organize information in smart ways.

People in the comments are excited about having a database inside their notes. Some think this could replace other tools like Notion or Airtable for simple tasks. Others are happy because their notes stay private and local, not in the cloud. A few say this is a big step for Obsidian and makes it even better for managing projects or tasks. Some users worry about learning new syntax or wonder if it will be hard to set up. Others ask about how well it works with big sets of notes or if it will slow things down. A few mention that more advanced features would be nice, like relationships between different bases. Some people want better mobile support, while others are just glad the basics work well on desktop. Many thank the developers for listening to feedback and making note-taking more powerful. Overall, most people feel Bases is a solid new feature that will help them stay organized.

- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44943986)

A small team wanted to build a tool to help developers use AI, but their project changed and became a Sims-style game instead. In this game, you can move a character around a virtual office, interact with things, and complete tasks, much like in The Sims. Instead of coding in a normal way, you guide your character to do work, talk to AI coworkers, and manage projects by clicking and choosing actions.

The game has a playful look, with cartoon graphics and simple controls. You can see your character’s goals, pick up items, and even have meetings with AI teammates. The creators say this was not their plan—at first, they just wanted a smart dev tool, but having a game-like interface made things more fun and easy to use. It also helped them show how AI can help with everyday programming work.

Some parts of the game are like puzzles. For example, you need to figure out the best way to solve tasks or keep your virtual team happy. The video walkthrough shows how to move around, start projects, and use AI helpers. It looks different from normal developer tools, focusing on fun and quick feedback.

Hacker News commenters had mixed feelings. Some people liked the playful idea, saying it could help new developers learn or make boring work more interesting. Others were not sure if a game interface is good for real programming, worrying it might slow experts down or hide important details. A few users joked about “gamifying” everything and wondered if this tool is just a toy or could be useful at work.

Some comments pointed out that more people are making games for serious tasks, not just for fun. Others asked if the game could be made more open or let players change the rules. Many agreed it’s a creative twist, even if it won’t replace normal code editors soon. Overall, the discussion showed both excitement and doubt, with people interested to see where this idea goes next.

- 原文链接: [Show HN: Whispering – Open-source, local-first dictation you can trust](https://github.com/epicenter-so/epicenter/tree/main/apps/whispering)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44942731)

Whispering is an open-source app that lets you turn your speech into text, all on your own device. You can press a shortcut, speak, and your words are quickly transcribed and copied to your clipboard. The app is private by design: your data stays on your computer unless you choose to use a cloud service, and even then, you use your own API keys with no middleman. 

Whispering works on Mac, Windows, Linux, and even in your web browser. You can pick from many transcription providers, like Groq, OpenAI, ElevenLabs, or use a local provider for free offline use. There’s no vendor lock-in, and you can see exactly what the code does because it’s open source. The app is small (about 22MB), fast to start, and uses little memory. You can set up custom workflows to fix grammar, translate, summarize, or format your text using AI, and all your settings are stored locally.

You only pay for the cloud API you use (as little as $0.02 per hour with Groq), or nothing at all if you use local transcription. Whispering has features like voice-activated hands-free mode, custom keyboard shortcuts, and deep privacy controls. The app is built with Svelte, Tauri, and Rust, and the codebase is made to be easy to read and audit. It’s easy to install, and there is good support for fixing common issues, like microphone permissions or shortcut problems.

In the comments, many users said they liked the privacy focus and that you don’t need to trust a “black box.” Some are excited to use their own API keys and save money over paid tools. Others like that the app is cross-platform and fast. People who care about open-source software say this is the kind of tool they want to support, and some mention they have already switched from paid tools to Whispering.

A few commenters talked about wanting even more offline features and were happy that local transcription is supported. Some shared concerns about using cloud APIs for private data, but liked that you can choose full local mode. Users discussed adding more providers or features, like support for different languages or better voice detection. Some asked about using Whispering for long recordings, and the creator explained it’s best for short dictation, not hours-long audio.

There was praise for the clear install instructions and for making the app easy for non-technical people. A few users had technical questions about the codebase, and others shared ideas for making it even more private or efficient. Some developers mentioned wanting to help contribute, and liked that adding new providers or features is well-documented. Overall, people see Whispering as a strong, useful tool that gives them more control over their speech-to-text experience.

## A minimal tensor processing unit (TPU), inspired by Google's TPU

- 原文链接: [A minimal tensor processing unit (TPU), inspired by Google's TPU](https://github.com/tiny-tpu-v2/tiny-tpu)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44945008)

This project is about building a very simple version of a tensor processing unit (TPU), inspired by Google’s own TPU chips. The team wanted to learn about hardware by creating an open-source TPU design, making it easier for anyone to see how these chips work.

The core of their TPU is a “systolic array,” which is a grid of small units called processing elements. Each processing element multiplies and adds values—this is the main job when running neural networks. Data moves across the grid in a special way: inputs move sideways, partial results move down, and weights stay in place. Before starting, input and weight matrices are rotated and moved to line up with the math needed for the array. After the systolic array, a vector processing unit (VPU) does things like add biases, run activation functions (like leaky ReLU), and calculate losses. All the data is stored in a unified buffer, which can quickly read and write inputs, weights, and results. The control unit is the “brain” that runs everything, using a custom instruction set that is 94 bits wide. This instruction set controls data flow, memory reads and writes, activation settings, and more. The team also describes how to add new modules, run tests, and view results with tools like gtkwave. They hope to eventually build a compiler for their instruction set and make bigger TPUs, up to 256x256 or even 512x512 in size. All their work is open source, and they welcome contributions from others.

People in the comments had a lot of different opinions. Some were excited to see an open-source TPU and said it would help others learn hardware design, especially since Google’s real TPU details are secret. Others pointed out that while this project is great for learning, it’s still far from what commercial TPUs can do in speed and scale. A few asked if it could run real machine learning models or if it’s just for small experiments. Some were curious about how the instruction set works and if it’s easy to write programs for this TPU. Others liked the clear explanation and thought the project could be used in universities or hobby projects. A few commenters shared their own stories of learning hardware by building small chips like this. Some people asked technical questions—like how well the systolic array scales or if the memory setup is enough for bigger tasks. There was also talk about the value of seeing detailed, open hardware projects, and how much can be learned by building things from scratch. A few wished for more guides or videos showing how to use the TPU or run tests. Overall, most people agreed that making chip design simpler and open is a good thing for everyone interested in learning about hardware.

## Left to Right Programming

- 原文链接: [Left to Right Programming](https://graic.net/p/left-to-right-programming)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44942936)

This article talks about how some programming languages make it hard for your code editor to help you as you write code, because of the way their syntax works. The author shows this problem with Python’s list comprehensions, where you have to type a lot before your editor knows what each variable is, making autocomplete and hints less useful.

In Python, when you start typing a list comprehension like `[line.split() for line in text.splitlines()]`, your editor does not know what `line` is until you finish the whole expression. This means you don’t get helpful suggestions for methods or variable names until it’s too late. If you make a mistake or don’t remember the exact method name, you have to go back and fix things. The author says this makes writing code less enjoyable and less productive.

The article compares this to Rust, where you can write code like `text.lines().map(|line| line.split_whitespace())`. In this way, you introduce `line` as you go, and your editor knows what `line` is right away, so it can help you with autocompletion. The code can be built up step by step, and at each step, it is valid. This means your editor or tools can always give you advice and suggestions as you type.

The author also mentions that in C, you have to remember function names like `fread` or `fclose`, and you don’t get hints by typing `file.` like you would in other languages. This makes it harder to discover new functions or remember what to do next. The author thinks programming should be more like using a good user interface, where you only see the options you need at each step.

The article gives more examples with Python and JavaScript. In Python, you have to remember if a function is called `len`, `length`, or something else, and if it’s a global function or a method. In JavaScript, you can type `word.l` and immediately see `length` in the suggestions, making it easier to write correct code. The author shows that as your code gets more complex, writing it in a left-to-right style—like chaining methods in JavaScript—makes it easier to understand and write.

They finish by saying that code should be valid as you type it, so your editor and tools can always help you. This makes programming smoother and helps developers avoid mistakes.

Commenters on Hacker News had a lot of opinions. Some agree that left-to-right, method-chaining style is easier and helps with autocomplete. Others say that list comprehensions and similar syntax are very readable once you get used to them, and editors could improve to better handle these cases. A few think that the problem is not just with syntax, but with how editors and language tools work. Some people prefer functional programming styles, like in Haskell, where expressions are built from right to left, and say this is also very powerful if you learn it.

There are comments saying that every language has trade-offs: what is easy to type in one language might be hard in another. Some users argue that Python’s syntax is designed for readability, not for editor features, and that changing it might make code harder to read for humans. A few suggest that better tooling—for example, smarter editors—would solve most of these problems, letting people keep their favorite syntax but also get good suggestions.

Some developers like the explicitness of languages like C, even if it’s less “discoverable,” because it helps you understand exactly what’s happening. Others wish more languages would support method-chaining or fluent interfaces to make programming smoother. There are also jokes about how every programmer wishes their favorite language worked like their second favorite, and that you can’t please everyone. Overall, people agree that making code easier to write and read is a good goal, but there is no perfect solution for every programmer or language.

## Show HN: I built an app to block Shorts and Reels

- 原文链接: [Show HN: I built an app to block Shorts and Reels](https://scrollguard.app/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44923520)

This article is about a new app called ScrollGuard that helps people block short video content like YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels. The app also lets users set time limits for scrolling on any app to avoid wasting time.

ScrollGuard works by stopping you from seeing Shorts and Reels on popular apps like Instagram, Facebook, Reddit, and YouTube. It has a feature called "antiscroll mode," which lets you set a limit for how much you can scroll in any app. The app promises there are no ads, so users can focus without distractions. ScrollGuard is available for download on the Google Play Store. The main idea is to help people avoid "doom-scrolling," which means endlessly watching short videos and losing track of time. The app wants to give control back to users so they can spend less time on addictive content and more time doing other things. The focus is on better mental health and productivity. It is designed to be simple and easy to use. The app targets people who want to stop wasting time on social media but find it hard to do so on their own. ScrollGuard hopes to be a solution for both adults and young people who struggle with endless scrolling.

In the comment section, many people shared their own struggles with short video content and doom-scrolling. Some users liked the idea and said they needed something like this to help them control their habits. Others wondered if the app would work well long-term, or if people would just find ways around it. A few commenters mentioned that self-control is important, and that blocking apps might not fix the root problem. There were questions about how the app works technically—does it use accessibility features, or does it block content at the network level? Some users were happy to see that there are no ads and the app is focused on privacy. Others asked if an iOS version is coming, since it’s only on Android so far. A few people said they already use similar tools, like digital wellbeing settings or browser extensions, but liked that this app is focused on short-form videos. There were also suggestions to add more features, like time reports or better customization. Finally, some users wondered if blocking content is enough, or if social media companies should do more to make their platforms less addictive.

## Counter-Strike: A billion-dollar game built in a dorm room

- 原文链接: [Counter-Strike: A billion-dollar game built in a dorm room](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/18/arts/counter-strike-half-life-minh-le.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44941369)

This story is about Minh Le, a college student who made the first version of Counter-Strike in his dorm room. His game started as a hobby but soon became a huge hit, with over 100,000 players online at once and earning him and his partner over $20,000 each month from ads.

Counter-Strike was released officially in 2000 by Valve, and it quickly turned into one of the most famous and influential shooting games ever. It led to many sequels and helped start the esports industry, making billions from selling cosmetic weapon skins. Minh Le’s interest in computers and games led him to the world of “modding,” where people change existing games to make new ones. Modding is usually cheaper and quicker than making a full game from nothing, letting people be creative even with little money or time.

Before Counter-Strike, Minh made other mods like Navy SEALs for Quake and Action Quake 2, inspired by action movies. These projects helped him learn the skills he needed to build Counter-Strike. The game’s simple idea—teams of terrorists and counter-terrorists fighting over hostages or bombs—was easy to play but very exciting and fun. This simple but deep design is a big reason the game became so popular for so long.

On Hacker News, many people were inspired by Minh Le’s story. They liked how a student, with few resources, could make something that changed the game industry. Some commenters talked about how modding is a good way for beginners to learn programming and game design. A few said that games like Counter-Strike show how important it is to let players and fans change games, as it can lead to big new ideas.

Others remembered playing Counter-Strike when they were younger and how it brought people together. Some worried that today’s games are harder to mod, making it more difficult for new developers to do what Minh Le did. There were also debates about how much money the game now makes from selling skins and if this is good or bad for gaming. A few people pointed out that big companies now try to control mods more than before, which can stop new ideas. But many agreed that Counter-Strike’s story shows how passion and creativity can make a huge difference, even from a simple dorm room.

- 原文链接: [FFmpeg Assembly Language Lessons](https://github.com/FFmpeg/asm-lessons)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44940485)

This post is about a GitHub project called "FFmpeg Assembly Language Lessons," which helps people learn how to write assembly code for FFmpeg. The lessons are made for programmers who already know some C and high school math, and want to understand how things work closer to the hardware.

The project gives step-by-step lessons on assembly language as used in FFmpeg, a popular software for working with video and audio. It explains what assembly is, why it is important, and how it helps make code faster. The lessons are set up so that by the end, you should be able to read and write some real FFmpeg assembly code. There are folders for each lesson, and the lessons come in different languages, including English, French, and Spanish. The project is open source, so anyone can help or ask questions, and there’s even a Discord server to talk to others and get help. The goal is to make assembly less scary and show how it is used in real projects.

The lessons start simple, showing basic instructions and how to use registers. Later, they move to more complex ideas like working with vectors and using special instructions for fast math. The project also plans to add assignments so you can practice. It is friendly to beginners but expects you to know C and some math first. The project has a lot of stars on GitHub, showing that many people are interested.

In the comments, some people say this is a great resource because good assembly tutorials are hard to find, especially those focused on real-life projects like FFmpeg. Others share that learning assembly helped them understand computers better, even if they do not use it every day. Some users note that writing assembly can make your code much faster, but it is also hard and easy to make mistakes. A few people warn that modern compilers are very good, so hand-written assembly is not needed as much as before, except in special cases. There are also comments about how knowing assembly helps with debugging and understanding what your code really does. Some are happy about the translations, saying it will help more people learn. Others wish for more exercises and examples, and a few ask about support for other architectures besides x86. One person points out that the Discord server is helpful and active. Some users are just happy to see FFmpeg making its internal knowledge public, saying this helps the whole programming community.

## Sikkim and the Himalayan Chess Game

- 原文链接: [Sikkim and the Himalayan Chess Game](https://www.historytoday.com/archive/feature/sikkim-and-himalayan-chess-game)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44915939)

This article tells the story of Sikkim, a small kingdom in the Himalayas, and its role in the conflicts between India, Pakistan, and China during the 1960s. It explains how Sikkim’s location made it important during the Indo-Pakistan War of 1965, especially when China and India faced off near its border.

The article begins by describing a TV report in 1965 that showed Indian and Chinese soldiers on the Sikkim-Tibet border. This was during the Indo-Pakistani war, but the real danger was that the conflict could draw in China and even start a larger war. Kashmir, a region disputed by India and Pakistan since 1947, was the main area of conflict. Both countries wanted control, and the local ruler tried to stay independent, but violence broke out and India took control after sending troops.

China took control of Tibet in 1950, which worried India. After the Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959, relations between India and China got worse. This led to a short war in 1962, where China beat India. Pakistan saw India as weak and tried to get Chinese help, hoping to push its claims in Kashmir.

Sikkim, squeezed between Nepal, Bhutan, and Tibet, had its own unique story. It signed a special treaty with India in 1950 but kept some independence. The ruling family had ties to Tibet and Britain, and the state became a base for secret CIA operations supporting Tibetan rebels. In 1963, Sikkim’s prince married Hope Cooke, a young American woman, making the tiny kingdom suddenly famous.

During the 1965 war, China sent troops near Sikkim, raising fears of a bigger war. The US, already busy with the Vietnam War, tried to calm things down. Behind the scenes, American diplomats worked to stop Pakistan and China from making things worse. In the end, Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire, but the people there felt let down.

Even after the crisis, Sikkim did not stay safe for long. India’s new leader, Indira Gandhi, later took control of Sikkim in 1975, ending its independence. Sikkim became an example of how small countries can get caught in the “chess game” of bigger powers.

In the comment section, some readers talk about how Sikkim’s story shows the danger for small states caught between stronger neighbors. Others say the US and Soviet involvement made things more complicated, and highlight how the Cold War influenced local conflicts. One commenter points out that the marriage of Sikkim’s prince to an American raised suspicions, while another thinks India’s takeover of Sikkim was unfair but common in history. A few people discuss the ongoing tensions between India and China in the Himalayas and how the 1960s events still matter today. Some note that Sikkim’s culture survived despite political changes, while others feel sadness that local voices were ignored. There is also debate about whether outside powers helped or hurt stability in the region. Finally, some users share personal memories or family stories from the time, showing how these big events touched ordinary lives.
