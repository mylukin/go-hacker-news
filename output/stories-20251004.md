## Blog Feeds

This article talks about bringing back the old days of the web, when people shared ideas and stories through personal blogs, not social media. It explains how anyone can start a simple blog and connect with others using RSS feeds, without needing to join a big platform.

The main idea is that blogging can be easy and casual—you don’t need to be a professional writer or worry about making money. You just share your thoughts, photos, recipes, or anything you like. You can use simple blogging services or set up your own blog if you want more control. To follow other blogs, you use something called an RSS reader. This lets you subscribe to blogs and see new posts in one place, just like a newsletter goes to your email.

The article suggests making a “feeds page” on your blog, where you list all the blogs you follow. This helps others find new blogs and keeps the network growing. You can even share your feeds using special files (called OPML) to make it easy for others to follow the same blogs.

There’s no big company in charge—just you, web standards, and the people you want to connect with. You don’t sign up or pay to join. It’s not a replacement for social media, but a slower, more personal way to interact online. Monetization is possible, but not the main point. For comments and conversations, you can use blog comment sections, email, or other platforms—it’s all up to you and your readers.

In the Hacker News comments, some people love this idea and miss the old internet, saying RSS and personal blogs feel more honest and friendly. Others point out that RSS never really went away—many still use it, even if it’s less popular today. Some users worry that beginners might find RSS confusing, but others share tips and recommend easy-to-use tools.

A few commenters say that social media is so addictive because it’s easy and instant, while blogs take more effort and time. Some think the web would be better if more people used blogs and shared their feeds, but others doubt it will become popular again. There are also discussions about how to make commenting and conversations easier across different blogs. Some people talk about the pros and cons of self-hosting versus using big platforms.

Overall, many agree that this approach helps people control their own data and avoid big tech companies, but some wonder if enough people care to make it a real movement. Others appreciate that there’s no central authority or algorithm deciding what you see. A few share their own blogs and feeds pages, hoping more people join in.

## $912 energy independence without red tape

This article is about a solar power kit you can install yourself for around $912, made for renters or people who do not want a big, complex setup. The kit is easy to set up, does not need permits, and helps people get clean energy at home.

The author lists all the parts needed, with prices and Amazon links, showing the total cost is under $1,000. There are extra parts for remote tracking if you want to see how much energy you make. The system is based on a popular DIY 48V solar setup, and the author shares a guide that helped them build it. The solar kit makes about 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity each year, which could save someone in San Francisco around $550 a year on their power bill. The kit should pay for itself in about two years.

The article also talks about how much energy it takes to make the solar panels and battery, and how long it takes to “pay back” this energy use with clean power from the system—about three and a half years. The author says this system is safe and legal because it only powers your devices and never sends power back into the grid. You do need to run extension cords from your devices to the solar box, and then connect the box to your solar panels. If the sun is down and the battery runs out, the system can switch to using power from the wall so things like your fridge keep running. The author offers help if you want to build a system like this.

In the comments, some people like the idea because it helps renters or people in apartments use solar power without needing to change their home or get permission from a landlord. Others point out that running lots of extension cords can be messy or unsafe if not done carefully. Some think the payback numbers are too optimistic, because not everyone pays such high electricity rates, or because real-world energy production can be lower than expected.

A few commenters ask about fire safety and if the system could trip circuit breakers if too many things are plugged in. Others say this is not as good as a full home solar system, but it is a good step for people who cannot install one. Some people wonder if the system is really legal everywhere, since some places have rules about home wiring and what can be plugged in. People also talk about how easy it is to move the system, which is good for renters. There are suggestions to improve the kit, like making it look nicer or adding better tracking to see how much energy is made. Some users are excited to try this for small projects or backup power. A few are worried about the quality of the cheaper parts. Overall, most people agree it is a clever, simple way to start using solar power without a lot of trouble.
