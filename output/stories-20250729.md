- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44728188)

Shunsaku Tamiya, the former president of Tamiya Inc., has died at the age of 90. He was the person who helped make plastic model kits famous all over the world. Tamiya turned his family’s old lumber and transport business into a top company for model kits, making cars, planes, and radio-controlled toys. After a fire, the company changed from selling wood into making wooden and then plastic models. When plastic became popular, Shunsaku Tamiya pushed the company to focus on plastic models, known as “puramo” in Japan.

Tamiya worked hard to make his brand special. He asked his brother to design the famous “twin stars” logo and hired artists to make the box art clean and easy to spot. He was very serious about quality and detail. For example, when making a Porsche 934 Turbo model, Tamiya’s team went to the real Porsche factory many times to get the details right. They even bought a real Porsche 911 and took it apart just to make sure the model was perfect. Later, Shunsaku Tamiya drove this car himself during a big car race event in Japan.

Tamiya’s company became famous for its high-quality, easy-to-build kits, and helped many people learn about cars. In 2018, he won a big award in Japan for his work in the hobby industry. Many people, young and old, have enjoyed building Tamiya models for years.

In the comments, one person praised Tamiya’s quality and said it was always reliable. Another shared how building Tamiya models was a big part of their childhood, and how Tamiya introduced them to Japanese cars. They also noticed that younger people today might not have the patience for model building because of social media and wanting quick results. Someone else remembered how Tamiya kits were more expensive than others, but you could always tell they were better. Another person thanked Tamiya for making iconic models like The Hornet, a famous radio-controlled car. One commenter shared that their first Tamiya kit was not a car, but an Apollo Lunar Lander, showing that Tamiya made many types of models. Some people said there are not many company leaders like Tamiya left. Overall, people in the comments were grateful and remembered how much fun and inspiration Tamiya’s models brought to their lives.

## Learning basic electronics by building fireflies

- 原文链接: [Learning basic electronics by building fireflies](http://a64.in/posts/learning-basic-electronics-by-building-fireflies/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44725757)

This article is about someone who missed seeing real fireflies, so they decided to build their own blinking “fireflies” using basic electronics. The writer had little knowledge of electronics at first but wanted to learn by making a small circuit that could blink an LED like a firefly.

They started with an “Astable Multivibrator” circuit, which uses simple parts—resistors, capacitors, and transistors—to turn an LED on and off again and again. At first, they didn’t even know the basics, like the difference between voltage and current, so they learned step by step with help from AI and YouTube. Their first LED circuit worked, but the blinking was too fast and it didn’t stop during the day. To fix this, they learned about a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) that could make the LED blink only when it’s dark, just like a real firefly. After some mistakes, they wired it correctly, and it worked.

Next, they wanted to control how fast the LED blinked. By changing the resistor and capacitor values, they could make the blink slower or faster. They found out about potentiometers—resistors with a knob—and used one to fine-tune the blinking speed. They even built a web tool to predict blink delays and another to estimate battery life, finding their “firefly” could last for about 8 months on a battery.

There were problems along the way. Sometimes the circuit stopped working because of bad wires, so they switched to better ones. Circuit simulators online didn’t always work for their design. Soldering made smoke, so they made a homemade fume extractor with an old fan. When they needed a new capacitor, they took one from a broken power supply. The best part was testing the circuit in a dark room and seeing the small blinking light. Making the fireflies look nice was hard, too, but they used glue and covers to finish the job.

In the end, they built five fireflies. Seeing them blink in the dark brought a lot of happiness. The writer realized they loved learning by doing, even when it was hard or messy.

Hacker News commenters really liked the story and found it inspiring. Some shared their own memories of learning electronics as kids, saying hands-on projects are the best way to learn. Others gave tips: one said to use 555 timer chips for similar circuits, while another explained that LDRs can be tricky and need careful wiring. A few people talked about safety, pointing out the risks of soldering fumes and the importance of good ventilation. Some suggested using solar panels to make the fireflies even more like the real thing, charging during the day and blinking at night. A few mentioned open-source hardware kits that could help beginners. There were also debates: some thought simulators should work for all circuits, while others explained why real-world testing is still important. Many agreed that getting stuck and fixing mistakes is a big part of learning. Some just liked how the project brought back the feeling of joy from building something small and personal.

- 原文链接: [BugBash Ep1 – FoundationDB: from idea to Apple acquisition [video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1nZzQqcPZw)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44689565)

This podcast episode tells the story of FoundationDB, a database system that started as a small project and was later bought by Apple. The hosts talk about how FoundationDB used a new way of testing called deterministic simulation to make their database more reliable.

FoundationDB wanted to solve problems with database reliability and speed. Their system supports ACID transactions, which means it keeps data safe and consistent even if something goes wrong. The team focused a lot on concurrency control, letting many actions happen at once without errors.

At first, people in the market were unsure if FoundationDB could do what it promised. To prove it worked, the founders built a demo with plywood and lightbulbs to show how the system handled failures. This simple demo helped build trust with early users.

The key part of FoundationDB’s process was deterministic simulation testing. This kind of testing let them find and fix problems before they happened in the real world. The team ran many tests, simulating crashes and bugs, and made sure the database always recovered correctly.

As they improved the database, they learned many lessons about making reliable software. Over time, FoundationDB became the backend for big companies like Snowflake, DeepSeek, Apple, and Goldman Sachs. The podcast ends by talking about FoundationDB's legacy and its open-source future.

In the comments, some people are amazed at how much FoundationDB achieved with a small team. Others point out that deterministic simulation is still rare in the industry and wonder why more companies do not use it. One commenter says the plywood-and-lightbulb demo was a smart move, making a complex system easy to understand.

A few developers share their own experiences using FoundationDB and praise its stability. Someone asks why Apple does not talk much about FoundationDB, even though they use it a lot. Another person thinks the open-sourcing of FoundationDB was Apple’s best move, as it helped the whole tech community.

Some are curious about the technical details and want more deep dives on topics like ACID transactions or testing. Others argue that the story shows how important strong testing is for all software teams, not just database companies. There are also comments about the risks of getting acquired and how it changes a project’s direction.

Overall, the community sees FoundationDB as a great example of smart engineering, strong testing, and good storytelling. Many hope that more startups will try similar ideas in the future.

## A month using XMPP (using Snikket) for every call and chat (2023)

- 原文链接: [A month using XMPP (using Snikket) for every call and chat (2023)](https://neilzone.co.uk/2023/08/a-month-using-xmpp-using-snikket-for-every-call-and-chat/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44726731)

This article is about someone using XMPP with Snikket for all calls and chats with his wife for a month, after switching from Matrix. The author explains that Matrix worked well for messages but often had problems with audio and video calls, sometimes working and sometimes not.

When they moved to XMPP with Prosody, messages were reliable, but Sandra’s iPhone did not get real-time notifications, and there were no alerts for incoming calls, which was a big problem. The author then installed Snikket, which is a simple XMPP setup, and they started using it for every call and message. Only twice did they have to use normal phone calls: once when there was very bad mobile data, and once when there was a strange delay on the call, probably from network problems.

Other than that, voice and video calls worked very well, even during long calls and while switching between Wi-Fi and mobile data. Sending messages and photos also worked perfectly. The author’s wife, who does not care much about technology, found XMPP easy to use, which was important. The author has not tried using XMPP with other people or different servers yet, but he does wish Snikket made it easier to use more than one domain name without new setups. He likes having his own small server at home, where all their messages are encrypted and private.

In the comments, some people praise XMPP for being open and decentralized, saying it is good to see it still working well. Others point out that XMPP can be hard to set up for non-technical users, but Snikket makes it easier. A few mention that XMPP used to have problems with group chats and media, but say that it has improved over time. Some users are surprised that notification problems still happen, especially on iPhones, and suggest that mobile support is still a weak point. Others compare XMPP to Signal, WhatsApp, and Matrix, saying each has pros and cons—XMPP is private and open, but less popular and sometimes harder to use.

A few commenters talk about running their own servers and enjoy having control over their data. Some worry that setting up XMPP for family members could be too technical. There are comments about the state of voice and video calling, with people agreeing that it has gotten better but might still not be as smooth as commercial apps. Others wish more people used XMPP so they could talk to friends outside their own home server. Some ask about security and encryption, and a few share tips for improving notifications on iOS. Overall, people are happy to see XMPP working well but agree it still needs to get easier for regular users.
