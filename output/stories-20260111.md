## The struggle of resizing windows on macOS Tahoe

- 原文链接: [The struggle of resizing windows on macOS Tahoe](https://noheger.at/blog/2026/01/11/the-struggle-of-resizing-windows-on-macos-tahoe/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46579864)

The article talks about problems people face when trying to resize windows on macOS Tahoe, the latest Mac operating system. The author explains that the new version has windows with very large rounded corners, and this change makes it hard to grab and resize windows like before.

The main issue is that the area you need to click to resize a window corner is now mostly outside the visible window. In older versions, most of this area was inside the window, so you could just move your mouse to the corner and drag. But with Tahoe, about 75% of this clickable area is outside the actual window, because of the big rounded corners. The author says this is not what people expect. When you see a window, you think you should be able to resize it by grabbing the inside corner. But now, if you try to do that, nothing happens. You have to move your mouse outside the window’s edge, which feels strange and unnatural. The author points out that this is a big change after decades of using computers, and it makes resizing windows more difficult and less reliable.

The article also mentions that many people are making fun of the new window design, calling it childish or silly. But the main focus is on how the design affects usability, not just style. The author uses pictures and simple examples to show exactly where you can and cannot grab to resize. They also say that this small change makes everyday tasks more annoying and less friendly for users.

In the comments, some people agree that the new design is hard to use and feels like a step backwards. A few share their own stories about missing the window edge and getting frustrated. Others say that Mac used to be easy and smooth, but now small updates like this make things worse. Some users think Apple cares more about how things look than how they work, and wish the company would listen to users more. There are also people who suggest using keyboard shortcuts or third-party apps to manage windows better. A few commenters defend the new look, saying they actually like the rounded corners, or that they quickly got used to the change. Some think it’s just a small problem and not a big deal, while others see it as part of a bigger trend with Apple software becoming less user-friendly. Overall, the comments show a mix of frustration, helpful tips, and debate about what matters most in good software design.

## iCloud Photos Downloader

- 原文链接: [iCloud Photos Downloader](https://github.com/icloud-photos-downloader/icloud_photos_downloader)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46578921)

This project is a free command-line tool that lets you download all your photos from Apple iCloud onto your own computer or server. It works on Linux, Windows, and macOS, and is popular with almost 10,000 stars on GitHub. The tool is called `icloudpd` and is managed by volunteers, but they are looking for new maintainers to help out.

The downloader comes as an app you can run directly, or you can install it using Docker, PyPI, AUR, or npm. You can also build it from the source code if you want. To use it, you need to change some iCloud settings: enable access to iCloud data on the web and turn off Advanced Data Protection on your Apple device. The tool can run in three ways: just copy new photos from iCloud, sync (copy and delete local files if removed in iCloud), or move (copy and then delete photos from iCloud). It supports Live Photos, RAW images, and can handle duplicate photo names. There are features for one-time downloads or for keeping your photos in sync all the time. You can use command-line options to change how it works, like setting how often it checks for new photos or updating photo metadata.

The tool supports two-factor authentication and you can check if your session is still active. It is open-source with an MIT license, so anyone can help to improve it. There is good documentation and many ways to get support or report bugs.

From the comments, many people are happy to see this tool because Apple does not make it easy to get all your photos out of iCloud, especially on non-Apple devices. Some users say this tool is very helpful for moving family photos to their own storage or backup system. Others warn that Apple sometimes changes their iCloud system, which can break tools like this, so you might need to wait for updates if problems appear. A few people share stories of using this tool on servers or NAS devices, and they like the automation. Some users wish Apple would offer official tools like this, while others are glad open-source projects can fill the gap. A few developers talk about possible privacy risks and suggest reading the code or using accounts with limited access. There is also some talk about trouble with two-factor authentication and needing to re-login often. Finally, many thank the project maintainers for making it easier to control their own data.

## I'm making a game engine based on dynamic signed distance fields (SDFs) [video]

- 原文链接: [I'm making a game engine based on dynamic signed distance fields (SDFs) [video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il-TXbn5iMA)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46539478)

This project is about building a new game engine that uses dynamic signed distance fields (SDFs) to let players change the game world in more detailed ways. The creator wants games to have worlds that are not just static, but can be changed smoothly and with high quality during gameplay.

The video explains that most games today, even ones like Minecraft or No Man’s Sky, only let you change the world in simple or “blocky” ways. This new engine can make smoother holes, tunnels, and even moving voids that can appear or go away as you play. The creator talks about how SDFs help with these detailed changes, and gives a short intro to how SDFs work. He shows that ray-marching with SDFs can be slow, so he uses tricks like caching SDF distances and interpolating between them to speed things up. There are challenges with memory use, so he stores distance data in a smart, sparse way, using a “brick-map” and “brick atlas” system. This lets the engine use less memory but still update the world quickly and with lots of detail.

The video also explains why the engine does not use triangle meshes (the usual way to make 3D worlds) and how it can support large, open worlds using geometry clipmaps. There are sections about dramatic memory savings, fast incremental updates, physics and collision, and how even terrain is handled as SDFs. The creator is working on a game using this engine and is excited for new kinds of gameplay and interactions.

In the comments, many people are excited about the technical progress and creativity. Some say this is what they want from games—new ways to interact, not just better graphics. One person suggests this engine would be perfect for a snowboarding or skiing game, while another is amazed at seeing so many SDF shapes used together. Some are surprised by how objects can melt or fuse together in the engine, saying it looks both strange and cool.

A few commenters discuss the possible gameplay, like using “negative SDFs” to make puzzles or change physics in new ways. There is praise for the clever use of sparse brick maps and geometry clipmaps, and for the creator’s software engineering skills. Some wish the engine had SDF-based collision or physics, and encourage trying that. There are also jokes and lighter comments, like laughing at a scene with Mr. Potato Head or saying the work is “wizard level.” Several people remember Sebastian Lague and Inigo Quilez for their SDF tutorials, showing this project is part of a broader community. Overall, the comments show both excitement for new gameplay ideas and respect for the technical work behind the engine.

## A set of Idiomatic prod-grade katas for experienced devs transitioning to Go

- 原文链接: [A set of Idiomatic prod-grade katas for experienced devs transitioning to Go](https://github.com/MedUnes/go-kata)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46531622)

This post is about a GitHub project called “go-kata” that gives daily coding challenges to help experienced developers learn idiomatic Go. The idea is to help you not just write working code, but code that follows Go’s best practices, especially in areas like concurrency, memory, and error handling.

The project includes many small exercises called “katas,” grouped by topic. For example, there are katas about handling context and cancellation in Go, which teach you to avoid memory leaks and make your programs stop quickly when needed. There are katas for better performance and memory use, like writing a fast JSON parser or using buffer pools. Some katas focus on HTTP servers, middleware, and writing code that is easy to test and deploy. There are also exercises on handling errors in Go’s special way, such as using “defer” for cleanup or handling tricky “nil” cases. Testing is another focus, teaching you to write tests that are parallel and use fuzzing.

The process is simple: pick a kata, read the challenge in its folder, try to solve it, and then compare your answer to a reference solution if there is one. The goal is not to learn Go from scratch, but to help people who already know how to code learn how to “think in Go” and write code that fits well with the Go community.

From the comments, many people say this is a great idea, especially for those coming to Go from other languages like Python or Java. Some like that the katas are practical and based on real-world problems, not just theory. Others say that learning idiomatic Go is hard, and this kind of focused practice helps avoid common mistakes that new Go developers often make. A few users point out that reading and writing lots of Go code is the best way to learn what “good” Go looks like, and these katas give a way to do that with feedback.

However, some commenters wish there were more beginner-level katas or more coverage of Go’s standard library. A few say that while katas are useful, it’s also important to work on real projects to see how Go is used in “production” code. Some also suggest adding more tests or explanations to the reference solutions. Overall, most people agree that this project fills an important gap for experienced developers who want to level up quickly in Go.

## Show HN: Epstein IM – Talk to Epstein clone in iMessage

- 原文链接: [Show HN: Epstein IM – Talk to Epstein clone in iMessage](https://epstein.im/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46571661)

A new tool lets people chat with an AI version of Jeffrey Epstein using iMessage. The website says you can "talk to Jeffrey Epstein" and even "start interrogation" with the bot.

The tool was built by a developer or team at photon.codes. There is also a Discord community linked, suggesting they want people to discuss or test the bot together. On the site, there are only simple links and a very direct invitation to chat with the Epstein clone. The idea is to let users ask questions or have conversations with an AI trained to act like Epstein. It’s not clear what data or text was used to build the AI's personality. The main focus seems to be curiosity or exploring what the bot might say. The project uses iMessage, so it works on Apple devices. There is little detail given about safety, privacy, or how the AI responds to sensitive topics. Some users might see it as a dark joke, while others might be interested in what the AI says about real-world issues. The project looks more like a tech demo than a serious research tool.

In the comments, some people say this project is in poor taste or disrespectful, especially since Epstein was a criminal. Others think it is just a tech experiment and not meant to be taken seriously. A few users worry about legal or ethical problems with making bots of real people, especially controversial ones. Some comment that using iMessage is clever, as it makes the bot easy to use. Others ask about how the AI was trained and if it can give useful answers. A few people warn that chatting with a bot like this could be risky or could upset some users. There are also jokes about what kind of things the bot might say. Some developers say the idea is creative but needs better warnings or rules. Others say projects like this show what AI can do now, for good or bad. A few people are interested in making similar bots with other famous or historical figures.

## Gentoo Linux 2025 Review

- 原文链接: [Gentoo Linux 2025 Review](https://www.gentoo.org/news/2026/01/05/new-year.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46574769)

The article is a review of Gentoo Linux’s progress and changes during 2025, looking back at the year and sharing plans for 2026. It covers new features, community activity, technical updates, and some important numbers about the project.

Gentoo added four new developers in 2025, coming from different countries and backgrounds, and continued to grow its community of contributors. The project managed over 31,000 ebuilds covering almost 20,000 packages, and released 89GB of binary packages for its main architecture. Gentoo saw a small drop in code commits and bug reports, but still fixed more bugs than it received. The GURU repository for user-contributed packages had less activity this year, but more people helped out.

Big technical updates included the decision to move away from Github to Codeberg for mirrors and pull requests, due to concerns about Copilot. EAPI 9 was finalized, bringing better build tools and error handling. The project was present at big open source events and ran both in-person and online workshops.

Gentoo improved its support for RISC-V, made WSL images available for Windows users, and dropped stable support for hppa and sparc because of old hardware. Packages got important updates: users can now choose between different GPG providers, zlib-ng is supported, and there’s a new jobserver tool to better manage build jobs. Rust, Ada, and D language bootstrapping is easier now, and FlexiBLAS helps switch BLAS libraries at runtime. Python and KDE packages are up to date.

Infrastructure improved with a new build server, and the wiki and handbook got many updates. Financially, Gentoo is stable, with most income from small donations. The project is slowly shifting its finances to Software in the Public Interest (SPI) and encourages donors to update their payment info.

In the Hacker News comments, many users praised Gentoo’s technical depth and flexibility, saying it teaches you a lot about Linux. Some shared stories about using Gentoo for years, while others said it’s too complex for daily use. People liked the move away from Github, seeing it as standing up for open source values, but a few worried about losing visibility. The new WSL images got users excited for easier Windows integration, though some questioned if Gentoo’s hands-on style fits WSL users. Users discussed the new jobserver and EAPI 9, with some saying it makes Gentoo even more powerful, and others noting the learning curve. Several appreciated the focus on RISC-V, while a few missed support for old hardware like sparc. Comments on finances were positive, with users happy to see transparency. A few asked about the slow pace of the SPI migration. Documentation updates and community workshops got a thumbs up, with new users saying the wiki is a great help. Overall, the discussion showed respect for Gentoo’s unique place in the Linux world, even from people who don’t use it every day.

## "Scholars Will Call It Nonsense": The Structure of von Däniken's Argument (1987)

- 原文链接: ["Scholars Will Call It Nonsense": The Structure of von Däniken's Argument (1987)](https://www.penn.museum/sites/expedition/scholars-will-call-it-nonsense/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46578957)

This article looks at Erich von Däniken’s famous book, "Chariots of the Gods?", and explains how his arguments are built. Von Däniken claims that ancient people were visited by aliens, and that these visitors changed human history and intelligence. The article does not try to disprove every detail, but instead shows that von Däniken’s way of arguing is flawed.

Von Däniken often uses two types of arguments. First, he says that old statues or carvings look like astronauts or spaceships to him, so they must be proof of aliens. For example, he says the carving on King Pakal’s tomb in Palenque, Mexico, shows a man flying a spaceship. Real experts say it shows a king entering the underworld, not a rocket. The article compares this to a child saying a cloud looks like a dog—it tells you about the child, not the cloud.

Second, von Däniken claims that if science cannot explain something, it must be because aliens did it. He points to the Iron Pillar in Delhi, saying it does not rust and must be made by aliens. But scientists have studied the pillar for years and know why it lasts—because of its special iron and the dry climate. Von Däniken also says the statues on Easter Island are a mystery, but other books show how local people carved and moved them with simple tools and teamwork.

The article warns that von Däniken sometimes ignores facts or leaves out information on purpose. Readers should use common sense, be skeptical, and not believe something just because it is written in a book. The author suggests using Occam’s Razor—choosing simple explanations over complex ones—and remembering that history should be explained by things we can see and test today.

In the comments, some people agree with the article and say von Däniken’s ideas are fun stories but not real history. They point out that his books are popular because people enjoy thinking about mysteries and aliens, even if the claims are weak. Others say that von Däniken’s books made them interested in archaeology and science when they were young, even if they later learned the truth. A few commenters defend von Däniken, saying that experts sometimes ignore strange facts, and that asking wild questions can help us look at history in new ways.

Some users are upset that von Däniken is not honest or careful with facts, calling his work misleading or dishonest. Others warn that too much skepticism can also be a problem, and that sometimes experts are too quick to dismiss new ideas. There is also a discussion about how hard it is for real archaeologists to correct popular myths once they spread. A few people note that the public often likes big, exciting stories more than careful science.

Commenters also talk about the responsibility of writers and publishers to tell the truth, and the need for better science education so people can spot bad arguments. Some say that it’s important to remember the real achievements of ancient people, without giving credit to aliens. In the end, most agree that being curious is good, but we should always check the facts before believing strange claims.
