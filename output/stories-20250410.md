## Uncovering a 0-Click RCE in the SuperNote Nomad E-Ink Tablet

- 原文链接: [Uncovering a 0-Click RCE in the SuperNote Nomad E-Ink Tablet](https://www.prizmlabs.io/post/remote-rootkits-uncovering-a-0-click-rce-in-the-supernote-nomad-e-ink-tablet)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43615805)

The article explores a serious security flaw in the SuperNote Nomad E-Ink Tablet. Researchers found a way to exploit vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, allowing attackers to install a rootkit without any action from the user. This 0-click exploit could let someone on the same network take over the device completely.

The researchers started by scanning the device with Nmap and found an open port, 60002, which wasn't immediately recognizable. They downloaded the device's firmware, which wasn't protected by encryption, allowing them to investigate further. They discovered a service using this port that seemed to function as a custom HTTP server. By manipulating the file-sharing feature, they could upload files to the device's INBOX directory.

They then tried a path traversal attack, which let them access other directories by modifying file paths. The device's firmware update mechanism, which checks for updates in a specific directory, was vulnerable. The researchers crafted a malicious firmware update, exploiting the fact that the device didn't properly verify file signatures. They faced an issue where filenames were altered during transfer, but they overcame this with a clever method involving sending two files simultaneously, exploiting a sort of race condition to place their malicious file with the correct name.

In the comments, users shared mixed reactions. One user noted that SuperNote's screen mirroring feature could make this exploit particularly dangerous. Others debated whether this was an honest mistake or something more sinister, pointing out that the company’s code is open for inspection. Some praised the cleverness of the exploit, while others pointed out that calling it a "0-click" exploit might be misleading since users do receive an update prompt, even if it defaults to installing automatically. Additionally, some users discussed how easy it is to sync notes from these devices to other services, with options like Google Drive and SyncThing being available.
