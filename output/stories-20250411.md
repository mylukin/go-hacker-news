The author compares this to the evolution of Spotify, which has moved away from being an iTunes alternative to a platform with inconsistent content offerings. The author suggests that companies are following a pattern of focusing on maximizing user engagement, similar to TikTok, at the cost of user experience.

In the comment section, various perspectives emerge. Some users believe that tech companies prioritize engagement to increase ad revenue, arguing that this approach can lead to a decline in quality and user satisfaction. Others point out that analytics often cater to the average user, neglecting the enthusiasts who initially drove the popularity of these platforms. Some commenters suggest that the focus on maximizing engagement is driven by short-term profit goals, which may not align with long-term user satisfaction. Additionally, there is debate about how companies like Netflix and Spotify could balance catering to both enthusiasts and the broader user base. Lastly, some users reflect on how consumer preferences and business strategies contribute to the current state of tech services, emphasizing the role of financial incentives in shaping product development.

## Default styles for h1 elements are changing

- 原文链接: [Default styles for h1 elements are changing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/h1-element-styles/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43649853)

The article discusses upcoming changes to the default browser styles for `<h1>` elements nested within sectioning elements like `<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, and `<aside>`. These changes mean `<h1>` will no longer adapt its size based on its nesting level, aligning more closely with accessibility practices. Developers are advised to define their own styles for headings to prevent issues and warnings from tools like Lighthouse, which now flag undefined `<h1>` font sizes as bad practice.

Previously, browsers used an outline algorithm that adjusted `<h1>` styling based on how deeply it was nested in sectioning elements, simulating heading levels like `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc. This caused confusion and inconsistent tool handling, leading to its removal from the HTML spec in 2022. Now, browsers like Firefox and Chrome are removing the remaining browser-specific styles, making `<h1>` styles consistent regardless of context. Developers should explicitly set font sizes and margins for `<h1>` elements to avoid warnings and ensure accessibility.

In the comments, opinions vary. Some users appreciate the move towards clarity and consistency, arguing that the outline algorithm was confusing and never widely adopted. Others miss the flexibility of the old system, where headings could adapt based on context. Some developers express concern over the potential for broken sites due to reliance on default styles. There's also a call for new HTML elements that could handle hierarchy more intuitively, avoiding the limitations of fixed heading levels. Overall, the change is seen as a push towards better practices, though not without challenges in adapting existing web content.

- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43648950)

A Fintech startup founder was charged with fraud for allegedly using human labor in the Philippines instead of AI as claimed. The app, marketed as an AI-powered solution, actually relied on people to perform tasks.

The article explains how this situation unfolded. Initially, the founder claimed that their app was powered by AI, and they raised millions from investors based on these claims. However, it was discovered that the app's automation rate was effectively zero, meaning humans were doing all the work. This misrepresentation led to the fraud charges. The article highlights a pattern where startups claim AI capabilities but use human labor as a stopgap measure, expecting the AI to improve over time. Nonetheless, this often leads to ethical issues and, in this case, legal action.

In the comments, many users drew parallels to other companies that have used similar tactics, where AI is more a marketing term than a reality. One user humorously suggested that "AI" sometimes stands for "Actually Indians," referring to human labor being masked as AI work. Others noted this as a recurring issue in tech, where companies make grand claims to attract investment without a functioning product. Some commenters critiqued investors for not doing proper due diligence, while others debated whether such practices can be considered fraud or part of typical startup culture. The discussion also touched on the broader implications of AI and human labor in tech, with some seeing it as a reflection of systemic issues in how tech solutions are marketed and sold.
