Hello everyone, this is the 2025-12-03 episode of Hacker News Daily Podcast. Today, we have a full lineup of technology news, security stories, and even some research about our furry friends. Let’s get started.

First, Ghostty, a modern terminal project, is now officially a non-profit under Hack Club. This means Ghostty will be managed as a charitable project, with a focus on being free and open source for everyone. Fiscal sponsorship by Hack Club lets them handle compliance, donations, and legal paperwork, so the developers can spend more time building Ghostty itself. Founder Mitchell Hashimoto says this step keeps Ghostty safe from being sold or changed for profit, and it builds trust with users. While he is the main donor for now, the new status lets others give money safely, with all funds visible to the public. There are strict rules so no money can go to him personally. The project’s name and code now belong to the non-profit, and Ghostty will keep its MIT license. The team also hopes to start paying contributors and support related projects. Hack Club takes 7% of donations for their help. Hashimoto’s family is also giving $150,000 to Hack Club directly, as extra support.

In the comments, many praise this move for building trust and setting an example for open-source projects. People are glad Ghostty is no longer tied to one person or company, which could make it last longer. Some mention that non-profit status helps with donations and shows the project is serious. A few worry that the founder still has power, but most agree legal rules help. Others ask about future leadership and are interested in the public ledger for finances. There are also positive comments about Hack Club, saying they do good work for young people in tech. Some note how rare it is for terminal projects to get this level of attention and money, and wonder if it could work for other open-source tools. Overall, the community wishes Ghostty success and hopes more projects follow this model.

Next, a security researcher found a critical bug in Filevine, a billion-dollar legal AI tool used by law firms. The researcher, while checking a demo version, found hidden JavaScript that revealed how the site connects to its data. He discovered an API endpoint without any password. By sending a simple request, he got a special token that gave him full admin access to the law firm’s entire storage—an open door to all files, including client documents, legal memos, payrolls, and even files protected by court orders and HIPAA. Searching for “confidential” returned about 100,000 results, showing the scale.

Realizing the risk, the researcher stopped and told the company immediately. Filevine fixed the issue quickly and thanked him. This is a good example of “responsible disclosure”—telling the company so they can fix the problem before going public. If a bad actor had found this, millions of private documents could have been stolen, causing huge harm. The researcher warns companies to be careful with AI tools and always check security.

Hacker News commenters were shocked at such a basic security mistake from a big company. Many praised the researcher for being responsible. Some said this shows why companies should not rush to use new AI tools, especially for legal or medical work. Others explained that API security is often missed when teams move fast. Some worried that there may be other companies with similar issues that have not been checked yet. People were glad Filevine responded quickly, but a few asked if the company should face legal action. Overall, this is a strong warning for anyone building or using AI tools with private data.

Now, let’s talk about Internet security and the ACME protocol. Before 2015, most websites did not use HTTPS encryption, so people’s data was not safe online. The main problem was that getting a security certificate was hard, slow, and cost money. To fix this, a group from Mozilla, EFF, Akamai, Cisco, and the University of Michigan created Let’s Encrypt. Let’s Encrypt gives out free certificates using the ACME protocol, which automates the process. Website owners do not need to do anything by hand. ACME lets software prove it controls a website and get a certificate automatically. This made it easy and free for anyone, not just big companies, to use HTTPS.

ACME became an official Internet standard in 2019, and now there are many ACME clients for different systems. HTTPS use has gone from about 40% to over 80% worldwide. ACME keeps improving, with new extensions like ARI for faster certificate renewal. The biggest challenge now is making sure people keep their ACME clients up to date, since many set it up and forget it. The protocol is also used by other certificate authorities, both free and paid, and by private companies for their own systems.

In the comments, many say ACME and Let’s Encrypt made the web safer and easier. Some remember when getting a certificate was expensive and slow, and are glad those days are over. Others like that ACME is open, so anyone can use or improve it. Some mention having to update scripts when ACME changes, and worry about what happens if people do not upgrade. A few ask if ACME could be used for other things, like device authentication, and some say this is already starting. There are technical discussions about which ACME challenges are best, and tips for using ACME with private systems. Overall, people agree ACME and Let’s Encrypt are big wins for open standards, security, and the Internet.

In hardware news, Micron has announced it will stop selling Crucial consumer products. Crucial is the well-known brand for SSDs and RAM for home computers. Micron says it wants to focus on business and data center customers, since that market is more stable and profitable. They will keep making memory, but only for companies, not for individual users. They promise to support existing Crucial customers for a while, but soon Crucial SSDs and RAM will disappear from stores.

The reasons include lower profits in the consumer market, tough competition, and changing demand. Big companies and cloud services now buy most of the memory, so Micron wants to serve them. Hacker News readers have mixed feelings. Some are sad or worried about losing a trusted brand. Others think it is a smart move for Micron, since selling to businesses is less risky and more profitable. Some point out that the consumer memory market is tough, with many price wars. A few wonder what will happen with support or warranties for Crucial products they already own. Others say there are still many memory brands to choose from, so it might not be a big problem. Some hope smaller brands will have a chance to grow, while others worry about less competition and higher prices in the future. A few share memories of building their first computer with Crucial RAM. Overall, there is both concern for home users and understanding of Micron’s business decision.

Next, there is big news from the world of Conway’s Game of Life. For the first time, someone has discovered a true one-dimensional spaceship, or "glider," with a length of 3.7 billion cells. The spaceship is "unidimensional" because it is only one cell thick vertically but very long horizontally. The creator, Hippo.69, used a mix of new and old techniques to make a pattern that moves forward, cleans up after itself, and repeats its cycle. Debugging was very hard, since the pattern is huge and normal tools are too slow, so special software was used to simulate and check the pattern.

The ship is built from several “arms” that use gliders to build, destroy, and move parts of the pattern. There are fuse arms to start the process, binary arms for writing bits, and ecca arms for efficient construction and destruction. Each arm has to fire gliders with perfect timing. The article shares code for running and checking the pattern in Golly, a popular simulator. After many tries, the ship finally works, and the files are shared for others to run. The ship has a period of over 133 billion generations and a starting box of more than 3.7 billion by 1 cell. The community has confirmed the discovery and is discussing names for the ship, like “Arrow 1” or “Unidimensional Spaceship 1.”

Many comments share congratulations and excitement. Some tried running the pattern but found it too big for their computers. Others ask for simple explanations or a wiki page. There are questions about stray gliders, with the creator explaining these were due to a small mistake in the sample, not the real design. Some discuss if this is the slowest possible spaceship, and how to make thicker ships. People talk about the technical tools, the need for a scientific paper, and ideas for future improvements. There are jokes, suggestions for names, and hopes for more macro spaceships soon.

Now, to an important security update: a serious vulnerability was found in React and Next.js, which could let attackers run code on your server without permission. The issue affects certain versions of React (19.0.0 to 19.2.0) and Next.js (15.x and 16.x), especially when using the App Router or special React Server Component packages. This bug is rated 10 out of 10 for risk. Attackers do not need special access—they can attack from anywhere. If successful, they can read, change, or destroy your data, and even break your service.

The problem comes from packages like react-server-dom-parcel, react-server-dom-turbopack, and react-server-dom-webpack. Early “canary” versions of Next.js are also affected. To fix it, update React to at least version 19.0.1, and Next.js to a patched version like 15.0.5 or 16.0.7. If you use a risky canary version, go back or update right away.

Many commenters are very worried because this bug is easy to use and can cause a lot of harm. Some say it is rare to see a perfect 10.0 risk score in a popular tool like React. Others point out that server-side code should be safer, so this breaks trust in these frameworks. Some developers are upset that experimental features like React Server Components are causing big problems. Others blame the fast pace of new releases, saying it makes software less safe. Some share advice on how to check if your app is at risk and how to upgrade safely. A few thank the team for fixing the issue quickly and making the details public, but others worry that many companies will not update soon enough, leaving users exposed. Some developers are thinking about switching to simpler tools with fewer risks.

Now, something lighter—a new study shows cats greet their humans with sounds, like meows, more often when the main caregiver is a man. Scientists watched cats and their owners at home, counting how often cats made greeting sounds. They checked if the person was a man or a woman, and if they were the main caregiver. The results showed cats used more vocal greetings when their main person was male. The study does not say why, but suggests it could be because of how men and women interact with cats or differences in their voices. Another reason might be that cats learn which behaviors get the most attention.

Hacker News commenters found the study interesting and wanted more details, like how many cats and people were in the research. Some joked that cats think men are more likely to give treats. Others said their own cats seem to act the same, no matter who is around. A few wondered if men and women respond differently to cats’ meows, which could change how often cats use vocal greetings. Some pointed out that cats are good at reading people and adjusting to get what they want. Others questioned if the study really proves anything, or if the difference is just random. Most liked learning something new about cats, but wanted clearer answers and more data.

Next, someone built a dashboard to compare mortgage rates from over 120 credit unions across the US. The tool helps people find better options when buying or refinancing a home, since credit unions often have lower rates than big banks. Credit unions are non-profit and member-owned, so they can offer loans with lower interest. But their rates are hard to find, since they do not advertise much. The dashboard collects rates daily and shows them next to national averages. For example, some 30-year fixed loans from credit unions have rates from 5.49% to 6.16%, lower than many banks. The dashboard also checks national data from the Federal Reserve for comparison.

The creator built the tool after finding their own bank had much higher rates than a local credit union. In the US, most mortgages are standardized, so differences are often due to advertising costs. The article encourages people to use the dashboard and get quotes from different lenders, since even a small rate difference can save thousands. Other tips include protecting your privacy before credit checks and using online guides to decide whether to buy, rent, or refinance.

Top comments praise the tool for making credit union rates easier to find. Some users say they saved a lot by going with credit unions. Others share that some credit unions have special rules about who can join, so not everyone can use every rate. Some wish the dashboard could include more local banks or lenders. A few discuss how buying a home can be confusing, and appreciate tools that make it simpler. Some point out that credit unions may have weaker online systems or customer service compared to big banks. Users ask technical questions about how the data is collected, and suggest adding filters for loan type or region. A few warn that rates can change quickly, and that buyers still need to follow up with lenders. Finally, people thank the creator for not taking referral fees or ad money, which helps them trust the information more.

For network admins, the article introduces Kea DHCP, a modern, open-source server for giving out IP addresses on networks. Kea replaces the older ISC DHCP server and has new features for today’s networks. It has a modular setup—separate programs for IPv4, IPv6, and DNS, so you can run only what you need. You can add features using “hooks,” and even write your own. Kea lets you change settings online using a REST API, without stopping the server. Network data can be stored in a database like MySQL or PostgreSQL, making it easier to share between servers or make backups. With the database backend, you can set up high-availability pairs, so your DHCP keeps working even if one server fails. There’s also a dashboard called Stork for managing many Kea servers, showing how many addresses are used, sending alerts, and helping with host reservations.

Kea is open-source, runs on Linux, Unix, and MacOS, and has pre-built packages for most systems. There’s a migration tool for people switching from ISC DHCP, and support options from community help to paid plans. The article also talks about different versions, mailing lists, and how to help the project.

In the comments, many users are happy to see a modern DHCP server with good support for IPv6 and databases. Some like the modular design, which makes it lighter and safer. Others like being able to change settings with the API, which fits automated setups and big networks. People discuss the Stork dashboard, saying it helps admins who manage many servers. A few worry about the complexity of using databases, saying simple files may be better for small networks. Some wish more advanced features were free, since some are in paid versions. There are comments about migrating from ISC DHCP—some found it easy, others needed manual fixes. Some remember DHCP server crashes and praise Kea’s high-availability. One notes Kea is written in C++, so it is fast, but warns to be careful with updates and security. Most agree that open-source and good documentation make Kea a strong choice for network admins today.

That’s all for today’s episode. Thank you for listening to Hacker News Daily Podcast. We’ll be back tomorrow with more news and stories from the world of technology.
