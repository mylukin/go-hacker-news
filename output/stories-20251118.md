Google has launched Gemini 3, their newest and smartest AI model, now available in many Google products and tools. Gemini 3 is designed to help you learn, build, and plan anything by using advanced reasoning and handling different types of data like text, images, video, and even code.

Gemini 3 Pro is much better than older versions at solving hard problems and understanding complex ideas. It scores top marks on many AI tests, including reasoning exams and coding tasks. The Deep Think mode, coming soon, will make Gemini 3 even smarter, especially for difficult or multi-step problems.

You can use Gemini 3 in the Gemini app, Google Search, AI Studio, Vertex AI, and a new platform called Google Antigravity. Antigravity lets developers use AI agents that can plan and carry out whole software projects, not just simple tasks. Gemini 3 can read and translate handwritten recipes, make flashcards from videos, analyze sports videos, and help you plan or organize your life.

For developers, Gemini 3 is very good at coding, creating apps, and solving tasks using computer tools. It works with other platforms like GitHub and Replit. It also helps with long-term planning, like managing a business in a simulation, and can handle tasks like booking services or sorting emails.

Google says Gemini 3 is also their safest model yet, with strong protection against attacks and better testing with outside experts. Google is careful with new features, like Deep Think, to make sure they are safe before everyone can use them.

In the Hacker News comments, some people are excited about Gemini 3’s new abilities, especially in understanding and planning. Developers like that it works with many tools and open platforms. Others are cautious, saying Google’s AI promises sometimes sound too good or are hard to use for real work. There are worries about privacy and how much control Google will have over user data and AI decisions.

Some users discuss if Gemini 3 can beat competitors like OpenAI’s models or if it is just good at benchmarks but not at real tasks. Others point out that Google’s history with shutting down products makes them nervous to rely on Gemini. There are also comments about the risks of agentic AI: some feel it could help automate boring work, while others worry about mistakes or AI making unwanted changes.

A few users praise Google for working on safety and inviting outside testers. Others say the actual results from using Gemini 3 will matter more than any claims or scores. Many are curious to see how Gemini 3 changes software development and daily life, but most agree that real-world testing and feedback will show if it truly starts a “new era” for AI.

- 原文链接: [I am stepping down as the CEO of Mastodon](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2025/11/my-next-chapter-with-mastodon/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45969909)

The article is about the founder of Mastodon stepping down as CEO and giving ownership of the project to a non-profit. After leading Mastodon for almost 10 years, he says this is the next step for the project and for himself.

He explains that Mastodon has grown bigger than just one person. The project is about community and open values, and he wants to make sure it stays true to those ideas. He talks about how being a CEO, especially of a social network, is very stressful and not always healthy. People expect a lot from you, sometimes comparing you to billionaires, even though you don’t have their money or support. He shares funny and strange stories, like being told to fight Elon Musk or being judged by newspapers for his clothes.

He says these small things can wear you down over time. One bad interaction with a user last summer made him realize he needed to step away and take care of himself. He believes one of his main jobs as CEO was to say “no” to ideas that would have pulled the project in too many directions. He thinks this helped Mastodon avoid problems, but he also admits that not liking public attention may have caused the project to miss some big media chances.

He is proud of how far Mastodon has come, starting as a simple project in his bedroom and growing into a big, important part of the internet. He still cares a lot about Mastodon and the fediverse, calling them a bright spot in a tough online world. Even though he will not be CEO, he will still help out behind the scenes.

In the comments, many people thank him for his hard work and vision. Some say this is a brave move, and it shows good leadership to step down and avoid the problems some founders cause. Others wonder how Mastodon will do without him, hoping the non-profit keeps things running well. A few people discuss how running a social network is very hard and stressful, and they respect his honesty about mental health.

Some comment that Mastodon’s focus on community is rare today, and they hope it stays open and safe. There are also worries about what happens when founders leave—some projects lose their way—but others point out that moving to a non-profit can protect Mastodon from being bought or changed too much. People also share their own stories about burnout and how hard it is to keep a healthy balance when running big projects. Most agree that Mastodon is special because it is not about money or power, but about helping people connect.

- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45971726)

GitHub had problems with Git operations like push and pull, making it hard for people to use their code repositories. The issue affected both SSH and HTTP connections, and Codespaces was also not working well. GitHub shared updates as they tried to fix the problem. First, they said they were looking into failures with Git operations. After some time, they noticed the problem was with Git HTTP actions and that many users could not use Git as normal. Codespaces, which lets you code in the cloud, was also having trouble. GitHub found what was likely causing the issue and worked on a solution. Later, they shipped a fix and saw things starting to get better in some areas.

Many people on Hacker News said they rely on GitHub every day, so even small outages cause a lot of trouble for developers and teams. Some users pointed out that many companies depend too much on a single service like GitHub, and problems like this show the risks. Others shared that they keep backups or mirrors of their code in other places, which helped them during the outage. A few people remembered times when they hosted their own Git servers and did not have these problems, but agreed that GitHub’s extra features are very useful. Some users were frustrated by the lack of clear, fast updates from GitHub during the outage, while others thought the status updates were good enough. There was also discussion about whether self-hosting is worth the extra work. A few developers joked about taking a break or doing other work while waiting for GitHub to recover. Others talked about how outages like this push teams to think more about “disaster recovery” plans. Some users praised GitHub for being quick with a fix, but others said even short outages are a big deal for software teams. Overall, many agreed that outages are rare but remind everyone how much they rely on cloud tools.

## Google Antigravity

- 原文链接: [Google Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45967814)

Google Antigravity is a new tool for developers that uses AI to help write and manage code. It is meant to make coding faster and easier by giving you smart help inside your editor, terminal, and browser all at once.

The main part of Google Antigravity is its AI-powered editor. You can use simple commands in English to ask the AI to write or change code for you. The editor also suggests code as you type, which can save time. There is a special agent in the tool that you can change or set up to match what you need. This agent can help you across different parts of your workflow, not just one place.

Google Antigravity uses a task-based system. This means you can see what the agent is doing and check the results, which helps you trust the AI more. The tool lets you manage several AI agents at once and control them from one “mission control” screen. You can give feedback to the AI, and it will use your feedback to get better at helping you.

The tool is made for all types of developers. If you work on the front-end, it can help you automate boring tasks in the browser. Full stack developers can use it to build apps with more confidence, because it checks and tests the code. Enterprise developers can use it to manage big projects and switch between tasks more easily. Google Antigravity is free to use right now.

In the Hacker News comments, some people are excited about how this could save time and make coding easier, especially for big teams or people who work on lots of projects. Others are a bit worried about trusting an AI with their code, and they want to know how safe and correct the results will be. Some users like the idea of using natural language to talk to the AI agent, saying it will help new coders or those who do not know every detail of a language.

A few developers say they want to see real demos or try the tool before they judge it. Some mention that there are already other AI coding tools, and they wonder if Google Antigravity is better or just another option. A common question is how well the tool works with private or sensitive code, and if it will keep their data safe. Others think managing many AI agents could get confusing or hard to control in big projects.

One commenter points out that having everything in one “mission control” could be helpful, but only if the user interface is simple and clear. Some people feel that AI tools are moving too fast and might change how coding works in the future, for better or worse. Others are just happy to see more free tools for developers to try out. There are also some jokes about the name “antigravity,” with people wondering if it will “lift the weight” of coding off their shoulders.

## Pebble, Rebble, and a path forward

- 原文链接: [Pebble, Rebble, and a path forward](https://ericmigi.com/blog/pebble-rebble-and-a-path-forward/)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45969250)

This article is about a fight between two groups in the Pebble smartwatch community: Core Devices (a new company making Pebble watches) and Rebble (a non-profit that has kept Pebble alive). The writer, Eric, started Core Devices and says both groups want Pebble to survive, but they disagree about who controls old Pebble apps and community data.

Eric explains that Core Devices and Rebble had a deal. Core Devices would pay Rebble to help support services. The deal broke down over who owns the old Pebble Appstore data—13,000 apps and watchfaces. Rebble says they own the data and want to limit access. Eric thinks the data should be free for everyone, not locked away by one group.

Eric answers four main complaints from Rebble. First, Rebble accuses Core Devices of stealing open source work, but Eric says all code used is open source and allowed by license. Second, Rebble says Core copied their library, but Eric says Core bought rights from the code’s authors and improved it, all as open source. Third, Rebble thinks Core promised Rebble could run the developer site, but Eric says this was never agreed and Core is running the site openly. Fourth, Rebble says Eric scraped their app store, but Eric says he only looked at watchface screenshots to pick favorites, not download data.

Eric shares the history: Pebble shut down in 2016, Rebble saved the app store data, and now Core Devices is making new Pebble watches using open source PebbleOS. Eric says he tried to work with Rebble, even hiring some Rebble people. But talks were slow and the two groups could not agree on how to share the app store data.

The main argument is about the app store archive. Eric thinks it should be public, maybe put on Archive.org, to honor the developers and keep Pebble open. Rebble wants to control access and says the data is theirs. Eric worries that if one group has too much control, the whole Pebble community could suffer.

For the future, Core Devices will keep their app store open, not require subscriptions, and work on new features. Eric says he wants to help other Pebble projects and is not trying to make lots of money—he just loves Pebble.

In the comments, some people support Eric, saying open data helps everyone and that Rebble is being too controlling. They think that Pebble was always about community and sharing, and feel sad to see a fight over old apps. Others side with Rebble, noting that they did the hard work to save and host the app store, so they deserve some control or credit. Some worry about legal risks if the data is shared without permission from old developers. A few people suggest both groups should focus on what is best for users and try to work together.

Other commenters point out that open source projects often have these fights, especially when money and business goals get involved. Some say it is normal for new companies and old community groups to clash. People hope both sides can agree so Pebble can have a good future. There is also praise for how much both groups have done to keep Pebble alive.

## The code and open-source tools I used to produce a science fiction anthology

- 原文链接: [The code and open-source tools I used to produce a science fiction anthology](https://compellingsciencefiction.com/posts/the-code-and-open-source-tools-i-used-to-produce-a-science-fiction-anthology.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45968121)

This article is about how one person made a science fiction story collection using open-source tools and code, even while working a full-time job and caring for kids. The author made a process that uses Python, YAML files, and LaTeX to organize, select, and publish the book, showing that you don’t need big budgets or fancy software to publish a quality anthology.

First, the author tracked almost 400 stories with plain YAML text files, not spreadsheets. This made it easy to use version control (Git), work with the data in Python scripts, and keep everything simple and human-readable. Each story had its own YAML file with title, author, and other details. He also made a main progress file to track which stories were accepted, rejected, or still being decided.

Next, the author wrote a small Python command-line tool called “se.py” to manage the stories and quickly see stats about the anthology, like word counts, number of authors, and which magazines were represented. This helped organize the work and keep goals in mind.

For making the print book, the author used LaTeX, a typesetting system often used for academic papers. He chose it because it creates professional-looking books, is easy to automate, and works well with version control. Custom fonts and styles were set up, and the author wrote scripts to convert stories from different formats (like Word or HTML) into LaTeX.

To make an ebook, the author used Pandoc to convert the LaTeX files into EPUB format. He then wrote a script to fix the table of contents in the ebook, adding author names like in the print version.

The main lessons were: keeping organized with simple formats is important, reproducible builds save a lot of trouble, and you don’t need to know everything before starting. Incremental improvement and transparent files made the work possible and not overwhelming.

People in the comments had many thoughts. Some praised the use of simple, open formats like YAML and LaTeX, saying it’s smart for long-term projects. Others liked the idea of using programming skills for creative work. A few professionals warned about the risks of skipping standard publishing tools, like InDesign, saying LaTeX can be tricky for non-technical users and may not always handle book design details well.

Some users suggested that even more tools could be automated, or that more could be shared for others to use. One commenter mentioned that using Git for tracking edits is great, especially for collaboration. Others asked practical questions about formatting, font licenses, and converting files. A few people shared their own experiences with self-publishing, noting that open-source tools can make the process empowering but also sometimes frustrating.

There was debate over the trade-offs between full control (with open tools) and the polish of professional publishing software. Some said that for technical people, the open-source workflow is fun and flexible, while others argued that the learning curve is steep. Many found the article inspiring, and said it made them want to try similar projects themselves. Some also noted the importance of having backups and reproducible steps, especially when working late at night or over many months. Overall, the comments showed a mix of excitement, practical advice, and some warnings about the challenges of do-it-yourself book publishing.

## Bild AI (YC W25) Is Hiring: Make Housing Affordable

- 原文链接: [Bild AI (YC W25) Is Hiring: Make Housing Affordable](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/bild-ai/jobs/m2ilR5L-founding-engineer-applied-ai)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45972390)

Bild AI is a new startup that wants to use AI to make reading construction blueprints easier, hoping this will help make building houses and other buildings cheaper and faster. They are looking for a founding engineer with skills in machine learning, computer vision, and Python to help build and improve their AI systems.

The company was started by Roop Pal and Puneet Sukhija, and is backed by big investors from Y Combinator. Their main idea is to use AI to solve hard problems in construction, like understanding blueprints, estimating costs, and handling permits. These tasks are usually slow and full of mistakes when done by hand. Bild AI wants to focus on the “intelligence layer,” which means making the actual AI models smarter, not just building a basic app. They use the latest computer vision and large language models (LLMs), and they want to quickly build prototypes, test them with real users, and keep improving. The company values honesty, learning fast, and being ready to deal with the boring or tough work (“schlep”) in startups. They prefer people who have built real products before, especially if they know about construction or have a startup background. The job is full-time, in-person in San Francisco, and open to new graduates or experienced engineers who are US citizens or have a visa. Bild AI says they are “customer-obsessed” and need people who want to have a big impact.

In the Hacker News comments, many people are interested in how Bild AI plans to actually solve the blueprint reading problem, since blueprints can be very complex and not always follow the rules. Some commenters ask if AI can really handle all the weird corner cases in construction documents, or if it will just add more confusion. Others say this is a good idea because construction is slow and full of manual work, so any automation could help. A few people warn that working with construction companies can be hard, since the industry is slow to change and not used to software tools. Some users are excited that Bild AI is hiring even new graduates, while others wonder if the small team size (just 5 people) might be risky for job security. There is also praise for the “model garden” approach—using different AI models for different problems—since this can give better results than relying on just one. Finally, some suggest that the real challenge will be getting customers to trust the AI’s answers, not just building the tech.

## Gemini 3 Pro Model Card [pdf]

- 原文链接: [Gemini 3 Pro Model Card [pdf]](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/Model-Cards/Gemini-3-Pro-Model-Card.pdf)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45963670)

Gemini 3 Pro is Google’s newest advanced AI model, capable of understanding and working with text, images, audio, video, and even code. The model card explains how Gemini 3 Pro was built, what it can do, and its safety measures.

Gemini 3 Pro uses a special “mixture-of-experts” architecture, which means only some parts of the model are used for each task. This makes the model both powerful and efficient. It can handle very large inputs—up to one million tokens—and produce big outputs, up to 64,000 tokens. The training data came from many sources: web pages, code, images, audio, video, and even user interactions with Google products, all filtered for safety and quality. The training process used Google’s TPUs and software like JAX and ML Pathways, which helped make the process faster and more energy-efficient.

Gemini 3 Pro is available through several Google products, APIs, and services, so developers can use it without special hardware. Tests show that this model is much better than the previous Gemini 2.5 Pro at reasoning, handling multiple types of inputs, and working with long documents. The model is meant for things like writing code, solving complex problems, planning, and creative tasks.

However, Gemini 3 Pro still has limits. Sometimes it makes mistakes, or “hallucinates.” There can also be slow responses or timeouts. Its knowledge is current only up to January 2025. There are strict rules on how the model can be used: no illegal, harmful, or misleading activities, and no use for hate speech, violence, or unsafe medical advice.

A big focus was on safety. The model was tested by both humans and automated tools to find weaknesses, and Google’s teams tried to break it (“red teaming”) to ensure it stays safe. The model’s safety performance is generally better or similar to previous versions, with some improvements in handling sensitive topics and fewer unnecessary refusals.

Commenters on Hacker News had mixed feelings. Some were impressed by the technical details, especially the large input and output limits and the mixture-of-experts design. They liked that Google shared more information about the data and safety steps. Others worried about the use of user data for training, even with privacy policies in place. There were concerns about the limits of safety filters—some believe they might block useful content or give too many false positives. A few people questioned if the benchmarks and safety scores are meaningful without more open, independent testing.

Some developers are excited to try the model for coding and research, while others want more transparency about the data sources and training process. There were debates about whether these models can truly be safe, and if the restrictions might make the AI less useful for some real-world tasks. A few thought Google’s safety claims sounded like marketing, while others appreciated the effort to be responsible. Several comments discussed the balance between innovation and caution, with some calling for even stricter controls, and others asking for more open access to the technology. Overall, the discussion was lively, with many people curious about how Gemini 3 Pro will work in practice.

## OrthoRoute – GPU-accelerated autorouting for KiCad

- 原文链接: [OrthoRoute – GPU-accelerated autorouting for KiCad](https://bbenchoff.github.io/pages/OrthoRoute.html)
- HN链接: [Hacker News讨论](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45970391)

This article is about OrthoRoute, a new GPU-accelerated autorouter plugin made for KiCad, a popular tool for designing circuit boards. The author built OrthoRoute because he needed to route a huge and very complex board with thousands of connections, which normal tools could not handle well.

The author first tried using existing autorouters like FreeRouting, but they were extremely slow and could only route a small part of the board after many hours. Hand-routing was not practical—it would take months. So, he decided to build his own tool, using the new IPC plugin system in KiCad, which allows faster and more powerful plugins with better access to board data. OrthoRoute builds its own model of the board, then uses a special routing algorithm called PathFinder, which was first made for FPGAs. This algorithm treats the board as a graph and routes all connections in steps, fixing problems like congestion over time.

Because the task is so big, OrthoRoute uses GPU acceleration to handle the huge number of calculations needed for each routing step. The author explains how he adapted the FPGA routing algorithm to work on PCBs, which are different because every board is unique. He also talks about many bugs and problems he faced, such as issues with the algorithm remembering past mistakes or oscillating between good and bad solutions. He fixed these by changing parameters and making the algorithm adapt to each board.

For the largest board, even his home GPU was not enough, so he created a way to export the problem, rent a powerful GPU in the cloud, and then import the results back into KiCad. The final board was routed in 41 hours on an 80GB GPU, a big improvement over the months it would take with normal tools. The result was good, though not perfect—some small mistakes remained, but it was much easier to fix these than to route the board by hand.

Now, OrthoRoute is open source and the author invites others to try it, improve it, or adapt it for new uses. He says autorouters are never perfect, but with OrthoRoute, even very big and dense boards can be routed much faster.

People in the comments were very interested in the technical details. Some praised the idea of using GPU acceleration and adapting FPGA algorithms for PCBs. Others pointed out that autorouting is still a hard problem and will never be perfect, but OrthoRoute’s speed is impressive. A few commenters asked about how well the tool handles design rule checks (DRC) and if it can be made more DRC-aware in the future. Some people discussed the pros and cons of autorouting versus hand-routing, agreeing that autorouters are good for simple or repetitive tasks, but critical signals still need careful manual routing.

Other comments wondered about the hardware requirements, since not everyone has access to a big GPU, and liked the idea of cloud-based routing. Several users said they would like to try OrthoRoute on their own large projects, and some shared stories about their own struggles with big or complex boards. There were also suggestions for future features, like support for flexible circuit boards or RF-specific optimizations. A few expressed concerns about the learning curve and asked for more documentation. Overall, the community was excited to see new tools like OrthoRoute pushing the limits of what is possible with PCB autorouting.
